positive,"Structural glycoprotein LmAbd-9 is required for the formation of the endocuticle during locust molting. Insect cuticle is a composite made of chitin filaments embedded in a proteinaceous matrix, consisting mainly of structural cuticular proteins. In the present study, an endocuticle structural glycoprotein gene, LmAbd-9, was characterized based on the Locusta migratoria transcriptome. LmAbd-9 encodes a glycoprotein with a chitin binding domain 4, belonging to RR-1 subclass of the CPR family, which has two potential O-linked glycosylation sites (S115 and T137) at which glycosylation modification may occur. LmAbd-9 was highly expressed in the integument and showed periodic expression during molting. The expression levels of LmAbd-9 were significantly down-regulated after injection with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) for 6, 12, and 24 h, whereas it was upregulated after double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference of the 20E receptor gene LmEcR and LmFTZ-F1beta at day 2 of fifth instar nymphs for 48 h. After injection of dsLmAbd-9 on day 2 of fifth instar nymphs, the insects could normally molt to adults and showed no macroscopic phenotype; however, the cuticle of the adults was thinner, and there were significantly fewer endocuticular lamellae than in the control. Thus, LmAbd-9 that negatively regulated by the 20E signaling pathway was involved in the formation of the endocuticle in L. migratoria. "
negative,"Gene discovery using massively parallel pyrosequencing to develop ESTs for the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. BACKGROUND: Flesh flies in the genus Sarcophaga are important models for investigating endocrinology, diapause, cold hardiness, reproduction, and immunity. Despite the prominence of Sarcophaga flesh flies as models for insect physiology and biochemistry, and in forensic studies, little genomic or transcriptomic data are available for members of this genus. We used massively parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform to produce a substantial EST dataset for the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. To maximize sequence diversity, we pooled RNA extracted from whole bodies of all life stages and normalized the cDNA pool after reverse transcription. RESULTS: We obtained 207,110 ESTs with an average read length of 241 bp. These reads assembled into 20,995 contigs and 31,056 singletons. Using BLAST searches of the NR and NT databases we were able to identify 11,757 unique gene elements (E<0.0001) representing approximately 9,000 independent transcripts. Comparison of the distribution of S. crassipalpis unigenes among GO Biological Process functional groups with that of the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome suggests that our ESTs are broadly representative of the flesh fly transcriptome. Insertion and deletion errors in 454 sequencing present a serious hurdle to comparative transcriptome analysis. Aided by a new approach to correcting for these errors, we performed a comparative analysis of genetic divergence across GO categories among S. crassipalpis, D. melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae. The results suggest that non-synonymous substitutions occur at similar rates across categories, although genes related to response to stimuli may evolve slightly faster. In addition, we identified over 500 potential microsatellite loci and more than 12,000 SNPs among our ESTs. CONCLUSION: Our data provides the first large-scale EST-project for flesh flies, a much-needed resource for exploring this model species. In addition, we identified a large number of potential microsatellite and SNP markers that could be used in population and systematic studies of S. crassipalpis and other flesh flies. "
positive,"Insulin-like peptides of the legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, and their mediation effects on hemolymph trehalose level, larval development, and adult reproduction. Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) of insects mediate various physiological processes including hemolymph sugar level, immature growth, female reproduction, and lifespan. In target cells of ILPs, insulin / insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) is highly conserved in animals. IIS in the legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is known to be involved in maintaining hemolymph trehalose levels and promoting larval growth. However, ILPs in M. vitrata have not been reported yet. This study predicted two ILP genes of Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 from transcriptome of M. vitrata. Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 shared high sequence homologies and domain architecture with Drosophila ILPs. Both ILPs exhibited similar expression patterns in most developmental stages, showing high expression levels in adult stage. In the larval stage, Mv-ILP1 and Mv-IlP2 were expressed mostly in the brain and fat body. However, in the adult stage, both ILP genes were expressed more in the abdomen than those in the head containing the brain. RNA interference (RNAi) of either Mv-ILP1 or Mv-ILP2 during larval stage resulted in significant malfunctioning in regulating hemolymph trehalose titers. RNAi-treated larvae also exhibited significant retardation of larval growth. RNAi treatment in adult stage interfered with the ovarian development of females. These results suggest that Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 play crucial roles in mediating larval growth and adult reproduction. "
negative,"Characterization of the basal angiosperm Aristolochia fimbriata: a potential experimental system for genetic studies. BACKGROUND: Previous studies in basal angiosperms have provided insight into the diversity within the angiosperm lineage and helped to polarize analyses of flowering plant evolution. However, there is still not an experimental system for genetic studies among basal angiosperms to facilitate comparative studies and functional investigation. It would be desirable to identify a basal angiosperm experimental system that possesses many of the features found in existing plant model systems (e.g., Arabidopsis and Oryza). RESULTS: We have considered all basal angiosperm families for general characteristics important for experimental systems, including availability to the scientific community, growth habit, and membership in a large basal angiosperm group that displays a wide spectrum of phenotypic diversity. Most basal angiosperms are woody or aquatic, thus are not well-suited for large scale cultivation, and were excluded. We further investigated members of Aristolochiaceae for ease of culture, life cycle, genome size, and chromosome number. We demonstrated self-compatibility for Aristolochia elegans and A. fimbriata, and transformation with a GFP reporter construct for Saruma henryi and A. fimbriata. Furthermore, A. fimbriata was easily cultivated with a life cycle of just three months, could be regenerated in a tissue culture system, and had one of the smallest genomes among basal angiosperms. An extensive multi-tissue EST dataset was produced for A. fimbriata that includes over 3.8 million 454 sequence reads. CONCLUSIONS: Aristolochia fimbriata has numerous features that facilitate genetic studies and is suggested as a potential model system for use with a wide variety of technologies. Emerging genetic and genomic tools for A. fimbriata and closely related species can aid the investigation of floral biology, developmental genetics, biochemical pathways important in plant-insect interactions as well as human health, and various other features present in early angiosperms.

negative,"Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for Yield and Weevil Resistance in Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam). KEY MESSAGE: We apply the GWAS to sweet potato genome, and identified the SNPs associated with yield and weevil resistance. The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is a highly heterozygous, outcrossing, polyploid species, which presents challenges for genetic analysis. Therefore, we considered that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may be applied to the study of the sweet potato genome. The yield of two sweet potato varieties [Purple Sweet Lord (PSL) and 90IDN-47] was assessed at two locations (Kumamoto and Okinawa prefectures) in Japan in 2013 and the yield scores were used for GWAS. The results showed that there were several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) above the significance thresholds in PSL; two peaks were detected in Kumamoto and Okinawa on the Ib03-3 and Ib01-4 linkage groups of PSL, respectively. As for 90IDN-47, one relatively high peak was detected in Kumamoto on the Ib13-8 linkage group. Interestingly, although high peaks above significance thresholds were detected in Kumamoto and Okinawa in PSL, the peaks were located in different linkage groups. This result suggests that the genetic regions controlling yield may change in response to environmental conditions. Additionally, we investigated the degree of weevil damage to the plants, which is the greatest problem in sweet potato cultivation in Okinawa. In this experiment, no SNPs were identified above the significance thresholds. However, one relatively high peak was found in the 90IDN-47 genotype, which showed resistance to weevils. On the other hand, one relatively high peak was also detected in the PSL genotype, which showed susceptibility to weevils. These results suggest that two regions could affect weevil resistance and may contain the gene(s) controlling weevil resistance. "
negative,"The power and promise of applying genomics to honey bee health. New genomic tools and resources are now being used to both understand honey bee health and develop tools to better manage it. Here, we describe the use of genomic approaches to identify and characterize bee parasites and pathogens, examine interactions among these parasites and pathogens, between them and their bee hosts, and to identify genetic markers for improved breeding of more resilient bee stocks. We also discuss several new genomic techniques that can be used to more efficiently study, monitor and improve bee health. In the case of using RNAi-based technologies to mitigate diseases in bee populations, we highlight advantages, disadvantages and strategies to reduce risk. The increased use of genomic analytical tools and manipulative technologies has already led to significant advances, and holds great promise for improvements in the health of honey bees and other critical pollinator species. "
negative,"Extracting single genomes from heterogenous DNA samples: a test case with Carsonella ruddii, the bacterial symbiont of psyllids (Insecta). Analysis of many bacterial genomes is impeded by the inability to separate individual species from complex mixtures of cells or to propagate cells in pure culture. This problem is an obstacle to the study of many bacterial symbionts that live intracellularly in insects and other animals. To recover bacterial DNA from complex samples, we devised a method that facilitates the cloning of DNA fragments of distinctive G+C contents in order to generate shotgun DNA libraries enriched in inserts having a specific base composition. DNA preparations are first treated with a restriction enzyme having a common cleavage site in a particular genome and then shotgun cloned following size-fractionation. This method was applied to whole bacteriomes of the psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta, which harbors the bacterial symbiont Candidatus Carsonella ruddii. The resulting libraries were highly enriched in bacterial sequences. Through the use of alternate enzymes and partial digests, this technique can be adapted to yield virtually pure DNA libraries for individual bacterial species. "
negative,"Identification, genomic organization and expression pattern of glutathione transferase in Pardosa pseudoannulata. The pond wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, is one of the dominant natural enemies in farmlands and plays important roles in controlling a range of insect pests. The spider is less sensitive to many insecticides than the target pests such as the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The different sensitivity to a certain insecticide between species is mostly attributed to the differences in both molecular targets and detoxification enzymes. As one of the most important detoxification enzymes, glutathione transferases (GSTs) play a key role as phase II enzyme in the enzymic detoxification in organisms. Until now, there are few studies on spiders' GSTs, limiting the understanding of insecticide selectivity between insect pests and natural enemy spiders. In this study, based on the transcriptome and genome sequencing of P. pseudoannulata, thirteen full-length transcripts encoding GSTs were identified and analyzed. Interestingly, Delta family, which is thought to be specific to the Insecta, was identified in P. pseudoannulata. Further, vertebrate / mammalian-specific Mu family was also identified in P. pseudoannulata. The mRNA expression levels of cytosolic GSTs in different tissues were determined, and most GST genes were abundant in the gut and the fat body. To investigate GST candidates involving in insecticide detoxification, the mRNA levels of cytosolic GSTs were tested after spiders' exposure to either imidacloprid or deltamethrin. The results showed that PpGSTD3 and PpGSTT1 responded to at least one of these two insecticides. The present study helped understand the function of GSTs in P. pseudoannulata and enriched the genetic information of natural enemy spiders. "
positive,"MicroRNA Let-7 targets the ecdysone signaling pathway E75 gene to control larval-pupal development in Bactrocera dorsalis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological processes during insect development; however, their role in larval-pupal development in oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) remains unknown. In the current study, we address the biological function of a conserved miRNA, Bdo-Let-7 in the regulation of BdE75 gene, which belongs to the ecdysone signaling pathway and participates in the larval-pupal development in B. dorsalis. Using dual luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells we show that Bdo-Let-7 miRNA interacts with the 3' untranslated region of BdE75 gene and suppresses its expression. The Bdo-Let-7 and BdE75 are also co-expressed in the larval-pupal stages and in different tissues of B. dorsalis. In in vivo experiments, the injection of Bdo-Let-7 agomir and antagomir in third instar larvae down- and up-regulated the expression of BdE75, respectively. The 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) injection assay shows that 20E up-regulated the expression of Bdo-Let-7 on the 5th day of the larvae. Moreover, abnormal pupation and eclosion were observed after larval Bdo-Let-7 antagomir injection. Based on these results, we show that Bdo-Let-7 regulates the ecdysone signaling pathway through the exact dose of BdE75 gene, and is indispensable for normal larval-pupal development in B. dorsalis. "
negative,"G protein-coupled receptors in arthropod vectors: omics and pharmacological approaches to elucidate ligand-receptor interactions and novel organismal functions. Regulation of many physiological processes in animals, certainly those controlled by neuropeptide hormones, involves G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our work focusing on endocrine regulation of diuresis and water balance in mosquitoes and ticks started in 1997 with the kinin receptor, at the dawn of the omics era. After the genomic revolution, we began work on the endocrinology of reproduction in the red imported fire ant. We will use the template of this comparative work to summarize key points about GPCRs and signaling, and emphasize the most recent developments in the pharmacology of arthropod neuropeptide GPCRs. We will discuss omics' contributions to the advancement of this field, and its influence on peptidomimetic design while emphasizing work on blood feeding arthropods. "
negative,"Virology, Epidemiology and Pathology of Glossina Hytrosavirus, and Its Control Prospects in Laboratory Colonies of the Tsetse Fly, Glossina pallidipes (Diptera; Glossinidae). The Glossina hytrosavirus (family Hytrosaviridae) is a double-stranded DNA virus with rod-shaped, enveloped virions. Its 190 kbp genome encodes 160 putative open reading frames. The virus replicates in the nucleus, and acquires a fragile envelope in the cell cytoplasm. Glossina hytrosavirus was first isolated from hypertrophied salivary glands of the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera; Glossinidae) collected in Kenya in 1986. A certain proportion of laboratory G. pallidipes flies infected by Glossina hytrosavirus develop hypertrophied salivary glands and midgut epithelial cells, gonadal anomalies and distorted sex-ratios associated with reduced insemination rates, fecundity and lifespan. These symptoms are rare in wild tsetse populations. In East Africa, G. pallidipes is one of the most important vectors of African trypanosomosis, a debilitating zoonotic disease that afflicts 37 sub-Saharan African countries. There is a large arsenal of control tactics available to manage tsetse flies and the disease they transmit. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a robust control tactic that has shown to be effective in eradicating tsetse populations when integrated with other control tactics in an area-wide integrated approach. The SIT requires production of sterile male flies in large production facilities. To supply sufficient numbers of sterile males for the SIT component against G. pallidipes, strategies have to be developed that enable the management of the Glossina hytrosavirus in the colonies. This review provides a historic chronology of the emergence and biogeography of Glossina hytrosavirus, and includes researches on the infectomics (defined here as the functional and structural genomics and proteomics) and pathobiology of the virus. Standard operation procedures for viral management in tsetse mass-rearing facilities are proposed and a future outlook is sketched.  "
positive,"Identification and Expression Analysis of Four Small Heat Shock Protein Genes in Cigarette Beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius). Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that play crucial roles in the stress adaption of insects. In this study, we identified and characterized four sHsp genes (LsHsp19.4, 20.2, 20.3, and 22.2) from the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius). The four cDNAs encoded proteins of 169, 180, 181, and 194 amino acids with molecular weights of 19.4, 20.2, 20.3, and 22.2 kDa, respectively. The four LsHsp sequences possessed a typical sHsp domain structure. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that LsHsp19.4 and 20.3 transcripts were most abundant in pupae, whereas the transcript levels of LsHsp20.2 and 22.2 were highest in adults. Transcripts of three LsHsp genes were highly expressed in the larval fat body, whereas LsHsp20.2 displayed an extremely high expression level in the gut. Expression of the four LsHsp genes was dramatically upregulated in larvae exposed to 20-hydroxyecdysone. The majority of the LsHsp genes were significantly upregulated in response to heat and cold treatments, while LsHsp19.4 was insensitive to cold stress. The four genes were upregulated when challenged by immune triggers (peptidoglycan isolated from Staphylococcus aureus and from Escherichia coli 0111:B4). Exposure to CO2 increased LsHsp20.2 and 20.3 transcript levels, but the LsHsp19.4 transcript level declined. The results suggest that different LsHsp genes play important and distinct regulatory roles in L. serricorne development and in response to diverse stresses. "
negative,"Microarray analysis reveals strategies of Tribolium castaneum larvae to compensate for cysteine and serine protease inhibitors. The transcriptome response of Tribolium castaneum larvae to dietary protease inhibitors was evaluated by whole-genome microarray analysis. RNA was isolated from guts of larvae fed control diet (no inhibitor), or diets containing 0.1% E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor), 5.0% soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI, serine protease inhibitor), or a combination of 0.1% E-64 and 5.0% STI. Data were analyzed by pairwise analysis, in which each inhibitor treatment group was compared to control, or ANOVA of all treatment groups. In pairwise analysis, the expression of only 253 genes was significantly altered (p<0.05) in response to STI treatment, whereas E-64 and combination treatments resulted in 1574 and 1584 differentially regulated genes. The data indicate that treatments containing E-64, whether alone or in combination, significantly impacts gene expression in T. castaneum larvae. ANOVA analysis revealed 2175 genes differentially expressed in inhibitor-treated larvae compared to control (p<0.05), including genes related to proteases that were mostly up-regulated, namely cathepsins B and L, chymotrypsins, and nonproteolytic cysteine cathepsin or serine protease homologs. Inhibitor treatments induced the differential expression of other gut-related genes, as well as genes encoding proteins of unknown function. These data suggest that T. castaneum larvae compensate for dietary cysteine protease inhibitors by altering large-scale gene expression patterns. "
positive,"Conserved roles of Osiris genes in insect development, polymorphism and protection. Much of the variation among insects is derived from the different ways that chitin has been moulded to form rigid structures, both internal and external. In this study, we identify a highly conserved expression pattern in an insect-only gene family, the Osiris genes, that is essential for development, but also plays a significant role in phenotypic plasticity and in immunity / toxicity responses. The majority of Osiris genes exist in a highly syntenic cluster, and the cluster itself appears to have arisen very early in the evolution of insects. We used developmental gene expression in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, and the wood ant, Formica exsecta, to compare patterns of Osiris gene expression both during development and between alternate caste phenotypes in the polymorphic social insects. Developmental gene expression of Osiris genes is highly conserved across species and correlated with gene location and evolutionary history. The social insect castes are highly divergent in pupal Osiris gene expression. Sets of co-expressed genes that include Osiris genes are enriched in gene ontology terms related to chitin / cuticle and peptidase activity. Osiris genes are essential for cuticle formation in both embryos and pupae, and genes co-expressed with Osiris genes affect wing development. Additionally, Osiris genes and those co-expressed seem to play a conserved role in insect toxicology defences and digestion. Given their role in development, plasticity, and protection, we propose that the Osiris genes play a central role in insect adaptive evolution. "
negative,"Characteristics of the genome of Arsenophonus nasoniae, son-killer bacterium of the wasp Nasonia. We report the properties of a draft genome sequence of the bacterium Arsenophonus nasoniae, son-killer bacterium of Nasonia vitripennis. The genome sequence data from this study are the first for a male-killing bacterium, and represent a microorganism that is unusual compared with other sequenced symbionts, in having routine vertical and horizontal transmission, two alternating hosts, and being culturable on cell-free media. The resulting sequence totals c. 3.5 Mbp and is annotated to contain 3332 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Therefore, Arsenophonus represents a relatively large genome for an insect symbiont. The annotated ORF set suggests that the microbe is capable of a broad array of metabolic functions, well beyond those found for reproductive parasite genomes sequenced to date and more akin to horizontally transmitted and secondary symbionts. We also find evidence of genetic transfer from Wolbachia symbionts, and phage exchange with other gammaproteobacterial symbionts. These findings reflect the complex biology of a bacterium that is able to live, invade and survive multiple host environments while resisting immune responses. "
negative,"Expansion of genes encoding a novel type of dynamin in the genome of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Screening of the entire genome of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, detected 15 genes for putative dynamin superfamily proteins - self-assembling large GTPases that are involved in the fission and fusion of membranes. In addition to a single gene each for Dyn, Drp1, and Opa1, orthologues that are common in Metazoa, 12 genes encoding a novel type of dynamin were found. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these novel-class genes are monophyletic. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that expressions of four novel-class dynamin genes are highly up-regulated in the midgut, through which aphids take in phloem-sap diets and plant viruses. As this type of dynamin is absent from all other fully sequenced organisms, they may function in processes unique to aphids. "
negative,"Genomic approaches for understanding dengue: insights from the virus, vector, and host. The incidence and geographic range of dengue have increased dramatically in recent decades. Climate change, rapid urbanization and increased global travel have facilitated the spread of both efficient mosquito vectors and the four dengue virus serotypes between population centers. At the same time, significant advances in genomics approaches have provided insights into host-pathogen interactions, immunogenetics, and viral evolution in both humans and mosquitoes. Here, we review these advances and the innovative treatment and control strategies that they are inspiring.  "
positive,"A trypsin inhibitor-like protein secreted by Cotesia vestalis teratocytes inhibits hemolymph prophenoloxidase activation of Plutella xylostella. To establish successful infections, endoparasitoid wasps must develop strategies to evade immune responses of the host. Here, we identified and characterized a teratocytes-expressed gene encoding a trypsin inhibitor-like protein containing a cysteine-rich domain from Cotesia vestalis, CvT-TIL. CvT-TIL had a high expression level during the later developmental stage of teratocytes and was secreted into host hemolymph. Further experiments showed CvT-TIL strongly suppressed the prophenoloxidase activation of host hemolymph in a dose-dependent manner by interacting with PxPAP3 of PO cascade. Our results not only provide evidence for an inhibition between CvT-TIL gene and the host's melanization activity, but also expand our knowledge about the mechanisms by which parasitoids regulate humoral immunity of the host. "
negative,"Serine and cysteine protease-like genes in the genome of a gall midge and their interactions with host plant genotypes. Proteases play important roles in a wide range of physiological processes in organisms. For plant-feeding insects, digestive proteases are targets for engineering protease inhibitors for pest control. In this study, we identified 105 putative serine- and cysteine-protease genes from the genome of the gall midge Mayetiola destructor (commonly known as Hessian fly), a destructive pest of wheat. Among the genes, 31 encode putative trypsins, 18 encode putative chymotrypsins, seven encode putative cysteine proteases, and the remaining may encode either other proteases or protease homologues. Developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression profiles of the genes encoding putative trypsins, chymotrypsins, and cysteine proteases were determined by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Comparative analyses of stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns suggested that several genes are likely to encode digestive proteases in the M. destructor larval gut, including genes encoding putative trypsins MDP3, MDP5, MDP9, MDP24, MDP48, MDP51, MDP57, MDP61, MDP71, and MDP90; genes encoding putative chymotrypsins MDP1, MDP7, MDP8, MDP18, MDP19, and MDP20; and genes encoding putative cysteine proteases MDP95 and MDP104. The expression of some protease genes was affected by plant genotypes. Genes encoding trypsins MDP3, MDP9, and MPD23, chymotrypsins MDP20 and MDP21, and cysteine proteases MDP99 and MDP104 were upregulated in M. destructor larvae feeding in resistant plants, whereas genes encoding trypsins MDP12, MDP24, and MDP33, and chymotrypsins mdp8, mdp15, and mdp16 were downregulated in M. destructor larvae feeding in resistant plants. This study provides a foundation for further comparative studies on proteases in different insects, and further characterization of M. destructor digestive proteases and their interactions with host plants, as well as potential targets for transgenic wheat plants.  "
negative,"Oviposition-induced changes in Arabidopsis genome expression: anticipating your enemy? Plants have evolved exquisite ways to detect their enemies and are able to induce defenses responses tailored to their specific aggressors. Insect eggs deposited on a leaf represent a future threat as larvae hatching from the egg will ultimately feed on the plant. Although direct and indirect defenses towards oviposition have been documented, our knowledge of the molecular changes triggered by egg deposition is limited. Using a whole-genome microarray, we recently analyzed the expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves after oviposition by two pierid butterflies. Eggs laid by the large white Pieris brassicae modified the expression of hundreds of genes. The transcript signature included defense and stress-related genes that were also induced in plants experiencing localized cell death. Further analyses revealed that cellular changes associated with a hypersensitive response occur at the site of egg deposition and that they are triggered by egg-derived elicitors. Our study brings molecular evidence for previous observations of oviposition-induced necrosis in other plant species and might illustrate a direct defense of the plant against the egg. In this addendum, we discuss the relevance of the oviposition-induced gene expression changes and the possibility that plants use eggs as cues to anticipate their enemies. "
negative,"De novo assembly of honey bee RNA viral genomes by tapping into the innate insect antiviral response pathway. Bee pollination is critical for improving productivity of one third of all plants or plant products consumed by humans. The health of honey bees is in decline in many countries worldwide, and RNA viruses together with other biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors have been identified as the main causes. The rapid genetic variation of viruses represents a challenge for diagnosis. Thus, application of deep sequencing methods for detection and analysis of viruses has increased over the last years. In this study, we leverage from the innate Dicer-2 mediated antiviral response against viruses to reconstruct complete viral genomes using virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Symptomatic A. mellifera larvae collected from hives free of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and the parasitic Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) were used to generate more than 107 million small RNA reads. We show that de novo assembly of insect viral sequences is less fragmented using only 22 nt long vsiRNAs rather than a combination of 21-22 nt small RNAs. Our results show that A. mellifera larvae activate the RNAi immune response in the presence of Sacbrood virus (SBV). We assembled three SBV genomes from three individual larvae from different hives in a single apiary, with 1-2% nucleotide sequence variability among them. We found 3-4% variability between SBV genomes generated in this study and earlier published Australian variants suggesting the presence of different SBV quasispecies within the country. "
negative,The making of eusociality: insights from two bumblebee genomes. The genomes of two bumblebee species characterized by a lower level of sociality than ants and honeybees provide new insights into the origin and evolution of insect societies.  
positive,"Analysis of the insect os-d-like gene family. Insect OS-D-like proteins, also known as chemosensory (CSP) or sensory appendage proteins (SAP), are broadly expressed in various insect tissues, where they are thought to bind short to medium chain length fatty acids and their derivatives. Although their specific function remains uncertain, OS-D-like members have been isolated from sensory organs (including the sensillum lymph in some cases), and a role in olfaction similar to that of the insect odorant binding proteins (OBP) has been suggested for some. We have identified 15 new OS-D-like sequences: four from cDNA clones described herein and 11 from sequence databases. The os-d-like genes from the Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, and Drosophila pseudoobscura genomes typically have single, small introns with a conserved splice site. Together with all family members entered on GenBank, a total of 70 OS-D-like proteins, representing the insect orders Diptera, Dictyoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, and Phasmatodea, were analyzed. A neighbor joining distance phenogram identified several protein similarity classes that were characterized by highly conserved sequence motifs, including (A) N-terminal YTTKYDN(V / I)(N / D)(L / V)DEIL, (B) central DGKELKXX(I / L)PDAL, and (C) C-terminal KYDP. In contrast, three similarity classes were characterized by their diversion from these conserved motifs. The functional importance of conserved amino acid residues is discussed in relation to the crystal and NMR structures of MbraCSPA6. "
positive,"Transcription factor E93 regulates wing development by directly promoting Dpp signaling in Drosophila. Transcription factor E93 is a steroid hormone ecdysone early response gene and plays crucial roles in both the degradation of larval tissues and the formation of adult organs during insect metamorphosis with the prepupal-pupal-adult transition. However, the molecular mechanism underlying E93 regulation is poorly understood. In this study, we found that specific knockdown of the E93 gene in the Drosophila wing disrupted wing development. Analyzing ChIP-seq signals for E93 in Drosophila wing identified that the decapentaplegic (Dpp) gene was a potential downstream target of E93. ChIP-PCR analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that E93 could bind to the Dpp promoter and enhanced its activity. Furthermore, the expressions of Dpp and other components in the Dpp signaling pathway were upregulated following E93 overexpression in Drosophila S2 cells but were decreased after E93 knockdown in the wing. Moreover, the impairment of the Dpp signaling pathway phenocopied the defects of E93 knockdown on wing development. Taken together, our results suggest that E93 modulates the Dpp signaling pathway to regulate wing development during Drosophila metamorphosis. "
negative,"Insights into regulatory roles of MAPK-cascaded pathways in multiple stress responses and life cycles of insect and nematode mycopathogens. Fungal entomopathogenicity may have evolved at least 200 million years later than carnivorism of nematophagous fungi on Earth. This mini-review focuses on the composition and regulatory roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which act as stress-responsive signaling pathways. Unveiled by genomic comparison, three MAPK cascades of these mycopathogens consist of singular MAPKs (Fus3 / Hog1 / Slt2), MAPK kinases (Ste7 / Pbs2 / Mkk1), and MAPK kinase kinases (Ste11 / Ssk2 / Bck1). All cascaded components characterized in fungal entomopathogens play conserved and special roles in regulating multiple stress responses and phenotypes associated with biological control potential. Fus3-cascaded components are indispensable for fungal growth on oligotrophic substrata and virulence, and mediate cell tolerance to Na+ / K+ toxicity, which is often misinterpreted as hyperosmotic effect but readily clarified by transcriptional changes of Na+ / K+ ATPase genes and / or cell responses to osmotic polyols. Hog1-cascaded components regulate osmotolerance positively and phenylpyrrole-type fungicide resistance negatively, and also play differential roles in cell growth, conidiation, virulence, and responses to other stress cues. Ste11 has no stress-responsive role in the Beauveria Hog1 cascade despite an essential role in branched yeast Hog1 cascade. Slt2-cascaded components are required for mediation of cell wall integrity and repair of cell wall damage. A crosstalk between Hog1 and Slt2 cascades ensures fungal osmotolerance inside or outside insect. In nematode-trapping fungi, Slt2 is indispensable for cell wall integrity, conidiation, and mycelial trap formation, suggesting that the Slt2 cascade could have evolved along a distinct trajectory required for fungal carnivorism and dispersal / survival in nematode habitats. Altogether, the MAPK cascades are major parts of signaling network that regulate fungal adaptation to insects and nematodes and their habitats. "
negative,"Studying translational control in non-model stressed organisms by polysomal profiling. In stressed organisms, strategic proteins are selectively translated even if the global process of protein synthesis is compromised. The determination of protein concentrations in tissues of non-model organisms (thus with limited genomic information) is challenging due to the absence of specific antibodies. Moreover, estimating protein levels quantifying transcriptional responses may be misleading, because translational control mechanisms uncouple protein and mRNAs abundances. Translational control is increasingly recognized as a hub where regulation of gene expression converges to shape proteomes, but it is almost completely overlooked in molecular ecology studies. An interesting approach to study translation and its control mechanisms is the analysis of variations of gene-specific translational efficiencies by quantifying mRNAs associated to ribosomes. In this paper, we propose a robust and streamlined pipeline for purifying ribosome-associated mRNAs and calculating global and gene-specific translation efficiencies from non-model insect's species. This method might found applications in molecular ecology to study responses to environmental stressors in non-model organisms.  "
negative,"Enrichment of low-density symbiont DNA from minute insects. Symbioses between bacteria and insects are often associated with changes in important biological traits that can significantly affect host fitness. To a large extent, studies of these interactions have been based on physiological changes or induced phenotypes in the host, and the genetic mechanisms by which symbionts interact with their hosts have only recently become better understood. Learning about symbionts has been challenging in part due to difficulties such as obtaining enough high quality genomic material for high throughput sequencing technology, especially for symbionts present in low titers, and in small or difficult to rear non-model hosts. Here we introduce a new method that substantially increases the yield of bacterial DNA in minute arthropod hosts, and requires less starting material relative to previous published methods. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of brain transcriptional changes in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) queens exposed to carbon dioxide and physical manipulation. Mating is a complex process causing many behavioural and physiological changes, but the factors triggering them and the underlying molecular processes are not well characterized. In the present study we examine the effects of CO(2) (a commonly used anaesthetic in instrumental insemination that causes changes similar to those occurring after mating) and physical manipulation (which may mimic certain aspects of copulation) on the behavioural, physiological and brain transcriptional changes in honey bee queens. We show that while CO(2) causes cessation of mating flights and ovary activation, physical manipulation has additional effects on ovary activation and brain transcriptional changes. Comparisons with previous studies of honey bees and female Drosophila indicate that common molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating reproductive changes across different mating regimes and insect orders. "
negative,"Changes in gene expression in the permissive larval host lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana, Tortricidae) in response to EppoNPV (Baculoviridae) infection. Host cell and virus gene expression were measured five days after per os inoculation of 3rd instar lightbrown apple moth (LBAM) larvae with the Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus (EppoNPV). Microarray analysis identified 84 insect genes that were up-regulated and 18 genes that were down-regulated in virus-infected larvae compared with uninfected larvae. From the 134 viral open reading frames represented on the microarray, 81 genes showed strong expression. Of the 38 functionally identifiable regulated insect genes, 23 coded for proteins that have roles in one of five processes; regulation of transcription and translation, induction of apoptosis, and maintenance of both juvenility and actin cytoskeletal integrity. Of the 34 functionally identifiable viral genes that were most strongly expressed, 12 had functions associated with these five processes, as did a further seven viral genes which were expressed at slightly lower levels. A survey of the LBAM-expressed sequence tag library identified further genes involved in these processes. In total, 135 insect genes and 38 viral genes were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-one insect genes were strongly up-regulated and 31 genes strongly down-regulated. All 38 viral genes examined were highly expressed. These data suggest that induction of apoptosis and regulation of juvenility are the major 'battlegrounds' between virus and insect, with the majority of changes observed representing viral control of insect gene expression. Transcription and translational effects seem to be exerted largely through modulation of mRNA and protein degradation. Examples of attempts by the insect to repel the infection via changes in gene expression within these same processes were, however, also noted. The data also showed the extent to which viral transcription dominated in the infected insects at five days post inoculation. "
positive,"Functional characterization of odorant-binding proteins from the scarab beetle Holotrichia oblita based on semiochemical-induced expression alteration and gene silencing. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to rapidly identify the entire repertoire of olfactory genes likely to be involved in chemical communication of an insect species. It remains, however, a challenge to identify olfactory proteins, such as odorant receptors and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), vis-à-vis the odorants they detect. It has been reported that exposing the olfactory system to a physiologically relevant odorant alters the transcript levels of odorant receptor(s) involved in the detection of the tested odorant. We applied this paradigm in an attempt to identify putative OBPs from the scarab beetle Holotrichia oblita involved in the reception of plant-derived kairomones. Twenty-nine OBP genes were identified in the H. oblita transcriptome, 20 of which were enriched in antennae compared with nonolfactory tissues. Of these, 2 OBP genes, HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9, were upregulated upon exposure to one of the female attractants (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol; none of the OBP transcripts changed upon exposure to methyl anthranilate, which does not attract H. oblita females. Binding assays showed that HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 have high affinity for (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol, respectively. RNAi treatment showed that transcripts of both HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 declined in a time-course manner 24-72 h postinjection. OBP-dsRNA-treated female beetles showed significantly lower attraction to (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol than did water-injected beetles and those treated with GFP-dsRNA. We, therefore, concluded that HoblOBP13 and HoblOBP9 are essential for H. oblita reception of the plant-derived kairomones (E)-2-hexenol and phenethyl alcohol. "
negative,"Identification of odorant-binding proteins of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti: genome annotation and comparative analyses. The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is an important human health pest which vectors yellow fever and dengue viruses. Olfaction plays a crucial role in its attraction to hosts and although the molecular basis of this is not well understood it is likely that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are involved in the first step of molecular recognition. Based on the OBPs of Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae we have defined sequence motifs based on OBP conserved cysteine and developed an algorithm which has allowed us to identify 66 genes encoding putative OBPs from the genome sequence and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of Ae. aegypti. We have also identified 11 new OBP genes for An. gambiae. We have examined all of the corresponding peptide sequences for the properties of OBPs. The predicted molecular weights fall within the expected range but the predicted isoeletric points are spread over a wider range than found previously. Comparative analyses of the 66 OBP sequences of Ae. aegypti with other dipteran species reveal some mosquito-specific genes as well as conserved homologues. The genomic organisation of Ae. aegypti OBPs suggests that a rapid expansion of OBPs has occurred, probably by gene duplication. The analyses of OBP-containing regions for microsynteny indicate a very high synteny between Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae. "
negative,"Annotated Draft Genomes of Two Caddisfly Species Plectrocnemia conspersa CURTIS and Hydropsyche tenuis NAVAS (Insecta: Trichoptera). Members of the speciose insect order Trichoptera (caddisflies) provide important ecosystem services, for example, nutrient cycling through breaking down of organic matter. They are also of industrial interest due to their larval silk secretions. These form the basis for their diverse case-making behavior that allows them to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Only five genomes of this order have been published thus far, with variable qualities regarding contiguity and completeness. A low-cost sequencing strategy, that is, using a single Oxford Nanopore flow cell per individual along with Illumina sequence reads was successfully used to generate high-quality genomes of two Trichoptera species, Plectrocnemia conspersa and Hydropsyche tenuis. Of the de novo assembly methods compared, assembly of low coverage Nanopore reads (∼18×) and subsequent polishing with long reads followed by Illumina short reads (∼80-170× coverage) yielded the highest genome quality both in terms of contiguity and BUSCO completeness. The presented genomes are the shortest to date and extend our knowledge of genome size across caddisfly families. The genomic region that encodes for light (L)-chain fibroin, a protein component of larval caddisfly silk was identified and compared with existing L-fibroin gene clusters. The new genomic resources presented in this paper are among the highest quality Trichoptera genomes and will increase the knowledge of this important insect order by serving as the basis for phylogenomic and comparative genomic studies. "
positive,"The AmCREB gene is an ortholog of the mammalian CREB / CREM family of transcription factors and encodes several splice variants in the honeybee brain. The transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) is required for the switch from short-term to long-term synaptic plasticity and from short-term to long-term memory. Its activity is regulated by the cAMP-dependent signalling cascade, which has been shown to play a crucial role in the honeybee's long-term memory formation. To elucidate the role of the CREB in honeybee memory formation we analysed a CREB-homologous gene, AmCREB, which is expressed as several transcripts in the honeybee brain. Eight transcripts have been identified (AmCREB 1-8) that are generated by alternate splicing. One antibody generated against a subset of these variants reveals a cytosolic localization in the mushroom body alpha-lobes, the glomeruli of the antennal lobes, the protocerebral lobes, the central complex and in the optical lobes. "
negative,"Recombination is associated with the evolution of genome structure and worker behavior in honey bees. The rise of insect societies, marked by the formation of reproductive and sterile castes, represents a major unsolved mystery in evolution. Across several independent origins of sociality, the genomes of social hymenopterans share two peculiar attributes: high recombination and low but heterogeneous GC content. For example, the genome of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, represents a mosaic of GC-poor and GC-rich regions with rates of recombination an order of magnitude higher than in humans. However, it is unclear how heterogeneity in GC content arises, and how it relates to the expression and evolution of worker traits. Using population genetic analyses, we demonstrate a bias in the allele frequency and fixation rate of derived C or G mutations in high-recombination regions, consistent with recombination's causal influence on GC-content evolution via biased gene conversion. We also show that recombination and biased gene conversion actively maintain the heterogeneous GC content of the honey bee genome despite an overall A / T mutation bias. Further, we found that GC-rich genes and intergenic regions have higher levels of genetic diversity and divergence relative to GC-poor regions, also consistent with recombination's causal influence on the rate of molecular evolution. Finally, we found that genes associated with behavior and those with worker-biased expression are found in GC-rich regions of the bee genome and also experience high rates of molecular evolution. Taken together, these findings suggest that recombination acts to maintain a genetically diverse and dynamic part of the genome where genes underlying worker behavior evolve more quickly. "
negative,"From development to biodiversity--Tribolium castaneum, an insect model organism for short germband development. Insect embryogenesis is best understood in the fruit fly Drosophila. However, Drosophila embryogenesis shows evolutionary-derived features: anterior patterning is controlled by a highly derived Hox gene bicoid, the body segments form almost simultaneously and appendages develop from imaginal discs. In contrast, embryogenesis of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum displays typical features in anterior patterning, axis and limb formation shared with most insects, other arthropods as well as with vertebrates. Anterior patterning depends on the conserved homeobox gene orthodenticle, the main body axis elongates sequentially and limbs grow continuously starting from an appendage bud. Thus, by analysing developmental processes in the beetle at the molecular and cellular level, inferences can be made for similar processes in other arthropods. With the completion of sequencing the Tribolium genome, the door is now open for post-genomic studies such as RNA expression profiling, proteomics and functional genomics to identify beetle-specific gene circuits. "
negative,"Genomic dissection of behavioral maturation in the honey bee. Honey bees undergo an age-related, socially regulated transition from working in the hive to foraging that has been previously associated with changes in the expression of thousands of genes in the brain. To understand the meaning of these changes, we conducted microarray analyses to examine the following: (i) the ontogeny of gene expression preceding the onset of foraging, (ii) the effects of physiological and genetic factors that influence this behavioral transition, and (iii) the effects of foraging experience. Although >85% of approximately 5,500 genes showed brain differences, principal component analysis revealed discrete influences of age, behavior, genotype, environment, and experience. Young bees not yet competent to forage showed extensive, age-related expression changes, essentially complete by 8 days of age, coinciding with previously described structural brain changes. Subsequent changes were not age-related but were largely related to effects of juvenile hormone (JH), suggesting that the increase in JH that influences the hive bee-forager transition may cause many of these changes. Other treatments that also influence the onset age of foraging induced many changes but with little overlap, suggesting that multiple pathways affect behavioral maturation. Subspecies differences in onset age of foraging were correlated with differences in JH and JH-target gene expression, suggesting that this endocrine system mediates the genetic differences. We also used this multifactorial approach to identify candidate genes for behavioral maturation. This successful dissection of gene expression indicates that, for social behavior, gene expression in the brain can provide a robust indicator of the interaction between hereditary and environmental information. "
negative,"Chromosome Painting in Triatomine Insects Reveals Shared Sequences Between X Chromosomes and Autosomes. In order to provide a broad picture on the origin and evolution of holocentric X chromosomes in heteropteran species, we prepared a sex chromosome painting probe by microdissection of the X1 and X2 chromosomes from a kissing bug Mepraia spinolai (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae). Fluorescence in situ hybridization on four species of the Triatomini having different amounts of autosomal heterochromatin and sex chromosome systems show that the Xs probe hybridizes on the euchromatin, located both on autosomes and X chromosomes. The heterochromatic Y chromosome and autosomal heterochromatic regions always appear free of hybridization signals. The hybridization results of the Xs probe on Rhodnius prolixus (Rhodniini) is completely different to that observed in Triatomini species. The hybridization signals are small and scattered on all euchromatin, without specific regions including the X chromosome. These results are in accordance with previous data obtained by genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescent banding, suggesting a clear differentiation in the repeat sequence composition of both sex chromosomes between Triatomini and Rhodniini tribes. These results also support that each sex chromosome in Triatomini has evolved independently from different autosomal pairs of a common ancestor, as described in other insect orders. "
negative,"Genomes of Diptera. Diptera (true flies) are among the most diverse holometabolan insect orders and were the first eukaryotic order to have a representative genome fully sequenced. 110 fly species have publically available genome assemblies and many hundreds of population-level genomes have been generated in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Comparative genomics carried out in a phylogenetic context is illuminating many aspects of fly biology, providing unprecedented insight into variability in genome structure, gene content, genetic mechanisms, and rates and patterns of evolution in genes, populations, and species. Despite the rich availability of genomic resources in flies, there remain many fly lineages to which new genome sequencing efforts should be directed. Such efforts would be most valuable in fly families or clades that exhibit multiple origins of key fly behaviors such as blood feeding, phytophagy, parasitism, pollination, and mycophagy. "
negative,"Genomic and transcriptional analysis of protein heterogeneity of the honeybee venom allergen Api m 6. Several components of honeybee venom are known to cause allergenic responses in humans and other vertebrates. One such component, the minor allergen Api m 6, has been known to show amino acid variation but the genetic mechanism for this variation is unknown. Here we show that Api m 6 is derived from a single locus, and that substantial protein-level variation has a simple genome-level cause, without the need to invoke multiple loci or alternatively spliced exons. Api m 6 sits near a misassembled section of the honeybee genome sequence, and we propose that a substantial number of indels at and near Api m 6 might be the root cause of this misassembly. We suggest that genes such as Api m 6 with coding-region or untranslated region indels might have had a strong effect on the assembly of this draft of the honeybee genome. "
negative,"Amplifying whole insect genomes with multiple displacement amplification. Many applications in insect genetics require repeated analyses on individual organisms. These include population genetic and genomics, linkage mapping, molecular systematics and map-based positional cloning. However, using the polymerase chain reaction, a limited number of analyses are possible with DNA isolated from whole bodies or parts of small or preserved specimens. We describe the optimization of a new technique, Multiple Displacement Amplification, for 100-400-fold amplification of whole mosquito genomes. We demonstrate that MDA amplifies genomic DNA directly from an adult leg or from organisms as small as a first instar mosquito larva. Genetic polymorphisms revealed at individual loci are the same whether using the original genomic DNA or MDA DNA as a template. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of differential mRNA expression of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus, mediated by the gene encoding a viral protein kinase (AMV197). Insect-born entomopoxviruses (Fam: Poxviridae) are potentially important bio-pesticide against insect pests and expression vectors as well as vectors for transient human gene therapies including recombinant viral vaccines. For these reasons, it is necessary to understand the regulatory genes functions to improve its biotechnological potential. Here, we focused on the characterization of serine / threonine (Ser / Thr; ORF AMV197) protein kinase gene from the Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus (AMEV), the type species of the genus Betaentomopoxvirus. Transcription of the parental and an amv197-null recombinant AMEV was compared by whole-genome gene expression microarray analysis. Blast2GO analysis reflected a broad diversity of upregulated and downregulated genes. Results showed that expression levels of 102 genes (45%) out of 226 tested genes changed significantly in the recombinant AMEV infected cells. Of these transcripts, 72 (70.58%) were upregulated and 30 (29.41%) were downregulated throughout the infection period. Genes involved in DNA repair, replication and nucleotide metabolism, transcription and RNA modification, and protein modification were mostly upregulated at different times in cells infected with the recombinant virus. Furthermore, transcription of all studied cellular genes including metabolism of apoptosis (Nedd2-like caspase, hemolin and elongation factor-1 alpha (ef1a) gene) was downregulated in the absence of amv197. Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR confirmed viral transcriptional changes obtained by microarray. The results of this study indicated that the product of amv197 appears to affect the transcriptional regulation of most viral and many cellular genes. Further investigations are, however, needed to narrow down the role of AMV197 throughout the infection process.  "
negative,"Beyond Drosophila: RNAi in vivo and functional genomics in insects. The increasing availability of insect genomes has revealed a large number of genes with unknown functions and the resulting problem of how to discover these functions. The RNA interference (RNAi) technique, which generates loss-of-function phenotypes by depletion of a chosen transcript, can help to overcome this challenge. RNAi can unveil the functions of new genes, lead to the discovery of new functions for old genes, and find the genes for old functions. Moreover, the possibility of studying the functions of homologous genes in different species can allow comparisons of the genetic networks regulating a given function in different insect groups, thereby facilitating an evolutionary insight into developmental processes. RNAi also has drawbacks and obscure points, however, such as those related to differences in species sensitivity. Disentangling these differences is one of the main challenges in the RNAi field. "
negative,"Genome-wide annotation of cuticular proteins in the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis), changes during pupariation and expression analysis of CPAP3 protein genes in response to environmental stresses. Cuticular proteins (CPs) are essential components of the insect cuticle as they create a structural and protective shield and may have a role in insect development. In this paper, we studied the CPs in the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis), one of the most economically important pests in the Tephritidae family around the world. The availability of a complete genome sequence (NCBI Assembly: ASM78921v2) allowed the identification of 164 CP genes in B. dorsalis. Comparative analysis of the CPs in B. dorsalis with those in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster and the closely related Ceratitis capitata, and CPs from mosquitoes, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera identified Diptera-specific genes and cuticle development patterns. Analysis of their evolutionary relationship revealed that some CP families had evolved according to the phylogeny of the different insect species, while others shared a closer relationship based on domain architecture. Subsequently, transcriptome analysis showed that while most of the CPs (60-100% of the family members) are expressed in the epidermis, some were also present in internal organs such as the fat body and the reproductive organs. Furthermore, the study of the expression profiles throughout development revealed a profound change in the expression of CPs during the formation of the puparium (pupariation). Further analysis of the expression profiles of the CPAP3 genes under various environmental stresses revealed them to be involved in the response to pesticides and arid and extreme temperatures conditions. In conclusion, the data provide a particular overview of CPs and their evolutionary and transcriptional dynamics, and in turn they lay a molecular foundation to explore their roles in the unique developmental process of insect metamorphosis and stress responses. "
negative,"Molecular characterization of mariner-like elements in emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera, Polyphaga). Emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis), an exotic invasive pest, has killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America and continues to threaten the very survival of the entire Fraxinus genus. Despite its high-impact status, to date very little knowledge exists for this devastating insect pest at the molecular level. Mariner-like elements (MLEs) are transposable elements, which are ubiquitous in occurrence in insects and other invertebrates. Because of their low specificity and broad host range, they can be used for epitope-tagging, gene mapping, and in vitro mutagenesis. The majority of the known MLEs are inactive due to in-frame shifts and stop codons within the open reading frame (ORF). We report on the cloning and characterization of two MLEs in A. planipennis genome (Apmar1 and Apmar2). Southern analysis indicated a very high copy number for Apmar1 and a moderate copy number for Apmar2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both elements belong to the irritans subfamily. Based on the high copy number for Apmar1, the full-length sequence was obtained using degenerate primers designed to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences of irritans MLEs. The recovered nucleotide sequence for Apmar1 consisted of 1,292 bases with perfect ITRs, and an ORF of 1,050 bases encoding a putative transposase of 349 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Apmar1 contained the conserved regions of mariner transposases including WVPHEL and YSPDLAP, and the D,D(34)D motif. Both Apmar1 and Apmar2 could represent useful genetic tools and provide insights on EAB adaptation. "
negative,"The impact of microbial symbionts on host plant utilization by herbivorous insects. Herbivory, defined as feeding on live plant tissues, is characteristic of highly successful and diverse groups of insects and represents an evolutionarily derived mode of feeding. Plants present various nutritional and defensive barriers against herbivory; nevertheless, insects have evolved a diverse array of mechanisms that enable them to feed and develop on live plant tissues. For decades, it has been suggested that insect-associated microbes may facilitate host plant use, and new molecular methodologies offer the possibility to elucidate such roles. Based on genomic data, specialized feeding on phloem and xylem sap is highly dependent on nutrient provisioning by intracellular symbionts, as exemplified by Buchnera in aphids, although it is unclear whether such symbionts play a substantive role in host plant specificity of their hosts. Microorganisms present in the gut or outside the insect body could provide more functions including digestion of plant polymers and detoxification of plant-produced toxins. However, the extent of such contributions to insect herbivory remains unclear. We propose that the potential functions of microbial symbionts in facilitating or restricting the use of host plants are constrained by their location (intracellular, gut or environmental), and by the fidelity of their associations with insect host lineages. Studies in the next decade, using molecular methods from environmental microbiology and genomics, will provide a more comprehensive picture of the role of microbial symbionts in insect herbivory.  "
negative,"An overview of functional genomic tools in deciphering insecticide resistance. In this short review, we highlight three functional genomic technologies that have recently been contributing to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning insecticide resistance: the GAL4 / UAS system, a molecular tool used to express genes of interest in a spatiotemporal controlled manner; the RNAi system, which is used to knock-down gene expression; and the most recently developed gene editing tool, CRISPR / Cas9, which can be used to knock-out and knock-in sequences of interest. "
positive,"Multiple functions of miR-8-3p in the development and metamorphosis of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The microRNA miR-8-3p is conserved among insects and closely involved in development and immunity, but its functions in vivo are unexplored in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Here, we show that miR-8-3p was highly expressed in late larva and early adult stages, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR. It was enriched in the fat body and cuticle in late larval tissues and abundant in the head and cuticle in early adult tissues, indicating this microRNA plays important roles during T. castaneum development. Specific inhibition of miR-8-3p in late larvae led to metamorphosis defects in the development of wings, eyes, legs and embryo. Moreover, a series of genes related to organism development were identified as miR-8-3p targets by computational prediction and microRNA-messenger RNA interaction validation, including Wingless, Eyg, Fpps and Sema-1a. These genes were critical for the regulation of the larva-to-adult transition. Eyg, as a functional target of miR-8-3p, participates in eye development, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and loss-of-function analyses. In brief, miR-8-3p is broadly involved in the development of wings, eyes and legs through its target genes and has extensive regulatory roles during T. castaneum development. "
negative,"Transcriptome analysis of the cowpea weevil bruchid: identification of putative proteinases and alpha-amylases associated with food breakdown. We describe here the first systematic work to discover insect genes involved in food breakdown using a cDNA library enriched for gut-expressed transcripts from Callosobruchus maculatus. A total of 1056 clones were screened for cDNA insert-containing plasmids, and 503 nonredundant open reading frames were discovered. Twenty-three inferred genes potentially involved in digestive processes in cowpea weevil were identified, including proteinases and amylases. The predicted catalytic sites were identified in the inferred cysteine and aspartic acid proteinases, and in alpha-amylases. Transcriptome analysis of the cowpea bruchid will potentially permit gene discovery in other beetles, an insect order of major economic and ecological importance that is poorly represented in genomic databases. "
positive,"Downregulation of imidacloprid resistant genes alters the biological parameters in Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (chrysomelidae: Coleoptera). Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (coleoptera: chrysomelidae), is the important pest of potato all over the world. This insect pest is resistant to more than 50 active compounds belonging to various chemical groups. Potential of RNA interference (RNAi) was explored to knock down transcript levels of imidacloprid resistant genes in Colorado potato beetle (CPB) under laboratory conditions. Three important genes belonging to cuticular protein (CP), cytochrome P450 monoxygenases (P450) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) families encoding imidacloprid resistance were targeted. Feeding bio-assays were conducted on various stages of imidacloprid resistant CPB lab population by applying HT115 expressing dsRNA on potato leaflets. Survival rate of insects exposed to CP-dsRNA decreased to 4.23%, 15.32% and 47.35% in 2nd, 3rd and 4th instar larvae respectively. Larval weight and pre-adult duration were also affected due to dsRNAs feeding. Synergism of RNAi with imidacloprid conducted on the 2nd instar larvae, exhibited 100% mortality of larvae when subjected to reduced doses of GSS and CP dsRNAs along with imidacloprid. Utilization of three different dsRNAs against imidacloprid resistant CPB population reveal that dsRNAs targeting CP, P450 and GSS enzymes could be useful tool in management of imidacloprid resistant CPB populations. "
positive,"Cloning and sequence of the gene encoding the muscle fatty acid binding protein from the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Muscle fatty acid binding protein (FABP) is a major cytosolic protein in flight muscle of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. FABP expression varies greatly during development and periods of increased fatty acid utilization, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression are not known. In this study, the gene coding for locust muscle FABP was amplified by PCR and cloned, together with 1.2 kb of upstream sequence. The sequence coding for the 607 bp cDNA is interrupted by two introns of 12.7 and 2.9 kb, inserted in analogous positions as the first and third intron of the mammalian homologues. Both introns contain repetitive sequences also found in other locust genes, and the second intron contains a GT-microsatellite. The promoter sequence includes a canonical TATA box 24 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The upstream sequence contains various potential myocyte enhancer sequences and a 160 bp segment that is repeated three times. In database searches in the genome database of Drosophila melanogaster, a gene with the same gene organization and promoter structure was identified, likely the dipteran homologue of muscle FABP. Upstream of both insect genes, a conserved 19 bp inverted repeat sequence was detected. A similar but reverse palindrome is also present upstream of all mammalian heart FABP genes, possibly representing a novel element involved in muscle FABP expression. "
negative,"Evolution of insect proteomes: insights into synapse organization and synaptic vesicle life cycle. BACKGROUND: The molecular components in synapses that are essential to the life cycle of synaptic vesicles are well characterized. Nonetheless, many aspects of synaptic processes, in particular how they relate to complex behaviour, remain elusive. The genomes of flies, mosquitoes, the honeybee and the beetle are now fully sequenced and span an evolutionary breadth of about 350 million years; this provides a unique opportunity to conduct a comparative genomics study of the synapse. RESULTS: We compiled a list of 120 gene prototypes that comprise the core of presynaptic structures in insects. Insects lack several scaffolding proteins in the active zone, such as bassoon and piccollo, and the most abundant protein in the mammalian synaptic vesicle, namely synaptophysin. The pattern of evolution of synaptic protein complexes is analyzed. According to this analysis, the components of presynaptic complexes as well as proteins that take part in organelle biogenesis are tightly coordinated. Most synaptic proteins are involved in rich protein interaction networks. Overall, the number of interacting proteins and the degrees of sequence conservation between human and insects are closely correlated. Such a correlation holds for exocytotic but not for endocytotic proteins. CONCLUSION: This comparative study of human with insects sheds light on the composition and assembly of protein complexes in the synapse. Specifically, the nature of the protein interaction graphs differentiate exocytotic from endocytotic proteins and suggest unique evolutionary constraints for each set. General principles in the design of proteins of the presynaptic site can be inferred from a comparative study of human and insect genomes. "
negative,"Genome sequence analysis of a novel Bacillus thuringiensis strain BLB406 active against Aedes aegypti larvae, a novel potential bioinsecticide. BLB406 is a novel isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis with a larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti larvae. It displays original plasmidic and crystal protein patterns. The present work reported molecular and bioinformatic analyses for the genome sequence of BLB406 using MiSeq Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. The reads were assembled by Velvet tool. Using RAST program and PGAAP, the genome of BLB406 strain was shown to contain 6297 genes corresponding to 5924 protein coding sequences. The BLB406 genome investigation with BtToxin_scanner program shows that this strain has an original and different combination of toxins compared to the published ones: five cry genes (cry11, cry22, cry2, cry60, cry64) and two distinct vegetative insecticidal vip4 genes. This combination provides a potential larvicidal and anti-cancer activities to BLB406. It might be a potential solution to some problems such as the narrow insecticidal spectra and insect resistance. The whole BLB406 genome information provides a valuable background for future in silico analyses as well as biotechnological applications in order to increase the production of commercial bioinsecticide based on BLB406 B. thuringiensis strain.

positive,"Influence of the RDL A301S mutation in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens on the activity of phenylpyrazole insecticides. We discovered the A301S mutation in the RDL GABA-gated chloride channel of fiprole resistant rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens populations by DNA sequencing and SNP calling via RNASeq. Ethiprole selection of two field N. lugens populations resulted in strong resistance to both ethiprole and fipronil and resulted in fixation of the A301S mutation, as well as the emergence of another mutation, Q359E in one of the selected strains. To analyse the roles of these mutations in resistance to phenylpyrazoles, three Rdl constructs: wild type, A301S and A301S+Q359E were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and assessed for their sensitivity to ethiprole and fipronil using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Neither of the mutant Rdl subtypes significantly reduced the antagonistic action of fipronil, however there was a significant reduction in response to ethiprole in the two mutated subtypes compared with the wild type. Bioassays with a Drosophila melanogaster strain carrying the A301S mutation showed strong resistance to ethiprole but not fipronil compared to a strain without this mutation, thus further supporting a causal role for the A301S mutation in resistance to ethiprole. Homology modelling of the N. lugens RDL channel did not suggest implications of Q359E for fiprole binding in contrast to A301S located in transmembrane domain M2 forming the channel pore. Synergist bioassays provided no evidence of a role for cytochrome P450s in N. lugens resistance to fipronil and the molecular basis of resistance to this compound remains unknown. In summary this study provides strong evidence that target-site resistance underlies widespread ethiprole resistance in N. lugens populations. "
positive,"RNA interference of tyrosine hydroxylase caused rapid mortality by impairing cuticle formation in Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). BACKGROUND: The application of RNA interference (RNAi) technique in controlling agricultural insect pests has been receiving much attention since the discovery of RNAi. The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a notorious pest of rice, has evolved a high level of resistance to many kinds of insecticides. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) is an indispensable survival gene in holometabolous insects, playing key roles in cuticle tanning and immunity. In this study, we investigated whether Th could be used as a potential target in controlling N. lugens. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that NlTh had a periodical expression pattern during molting with the highest level observed in epidermis. Dysfunction of NlTH by dsNlTh microinjection or 3-IT feeding similarly caused rapid death of N. lugens. Compared with dsGFP control BPHs, dsNlTh injected BPHs (i) had cuticle pigmentation and sclerotizaton defects; (ii) had less endocuticle lamella in tergum integument; (iii) showed higher mortality during the molting process as a result of defective cuticle shedding; (iv) showed feeding disorders indicated by a low number of probe wound dots on rice; (v) had more vulnerable cuticle. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that TH orthologues play a conservative and crucial role for exocuticle tanning in both holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects, and NlTh could be targeted for RNAi-mediated BPH control.

negative,"Detoxifying enzyme complements and host use phenotypes in 160 insect species. We use the genomes of 160 insect species to test the hypothesis that the size of detoxifying enzyme families is greater in species using more chemically diverse food resources. Phylogenetically appropriate contrasts in subsamples of the data generally support the hypothesis. We find relatively high numbers of cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase and carboxyl / choline esterase genes in omnivores and herbivores feeding on chemically complex tissues and relatively low numbers of these genes in specialists on relatively simple diets, including plant sap, nectar and pollen, and blood. Among Lepidoptera feeding on green plant tissue and Condylognatha feeding on sap we also find more of these genes in highly polyphagous species, many of which are major agricultural pests. These genomic signatures of food resource use are consistent with the hypothesis that some taxa are preadapted for insecticide resistance evolution. "
negative,"Expression of the Hsp83 gene in response to diapause and thermal stress in the moth Sesamia nonagrioides. A full-length Hsp83, named SnoHsp83, cDNA from the corn stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides, was cloned and sequenced. Genomic analysis showed that the SnoHsp83 gene is unique. The size of the SnoHsp83 cDNA was found to be approximately 2.6 kb. The deduced polypeptide comprised 717 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 82.6 kDa. It contained all the highly conserved amino acid motifs that characterize the cytosolic members of the hsp90 family. We investigated the expression of SnoHsp83 gene in response to diapause and heat / cold stress. SnoHsp83 is constitutively expressed in non-diapausing larvae and is induced 15-fold by heat. SnoHsp83 displays a similar pattern to SnoHsc70 under diapause conditions, when extra larval moults occur. Our results indicate that the SnoHsp83 gene could be involved in the developmental process that occurs between two moults. "
negative,"Genome Sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis Strain Btm27, an Egyptian Isolate Highly Toxic to Cotton Leafworm. Bacillus thuringiensis is a potent microbial control agent against insect pests. Here, we present the draft genome of the Egyptian strain Btm27 that shows high toxicity toward the cotton leafworm. The genome contains three insecticidal genes cry1Ac9, cry2Ab1, and vip3V that have been implicated in conferring toxicity toward lepidoptera.  "
negative,"Insect phylogenomics. Phylogenomics, the integration of phylogenetics with genome data, has emerged as a powerful approach to study the evolution and systematics of species. Recently, several studies employing phylogenomic tools have provided better insights into insect evolution. Next-generation sequencing methods are now increasingly used by entomologists to generate genomic and transcript sequences of various insect species and strains. These data provide opportunities for comparative genomics and large-scale multigene phylogenies of diverse lineages of insects. Phy-logenomic investigations help us to better understand systematic and evolutionary relationships of insect species that play important roles as herbivores, predators, detritivores, pollinators and disease vectors. It is important that we critically assess the prospects and limitations of phylogenomic methods. In this review, I describe the current status, outline the major challenges and remark on potential future applications of phylogenomic tools in studying insect systematics and evolution.  "
positive,"Characterization of three heat shock protein 70 genes from Liriomyza trifolii and expression during thermal stress and insect development. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) participate in diverse physiological processes in insects, and HSP70 is one of the most highly conserved proteins in the HSP family. In this study, full-length cDNAs of three HSP70 genes (Lthsc70, Lthsp701, and Lthsp702) were cloned and characterized from Liriomyza trifolii, an important invasive pest of vegetable crops and horticultural crops worldwide. These three HSP70s exhibited signature sequences and motifs that are typical of the HSP70 family. The expression patterns of the three Lthsp70s during temperature stress and in different insect development stages were studied by real-time quantitative PCR. Lthsp701 was strongly induced by high- and low-temperature stress, but Lthsc70 and Lthsp702 were not very sensitive to temperature changes. All three Lthsp70s were expressed during insect development stages, but the expression patterns were quite different. The expression of Lthsc70 and Lthsp702 showed significant differences in expression during leafminer development; Lthsc70 was most highly expressed in female adults, whereas Lthsp702 was abundantly expressed in larvae and prepupae. Lthsp701 expression was not significantly different among leafminer stages. These results suggest that functional differentiation within the LtHSP70 subfamily has occurred in response to thermal stress and insect development. "
negative,"A gene expression map for the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a maskless photolithography method to produce DNA oligonucleotide microarrays with unique probe sequences tiled throughout the genome of Drosophila melanogaster and across predicted splice junctions. RNA expression of protein coding and nonprotein coding sequences was determined for each major stage of the life cycle, including adult males and females. We detected transcriptional activity for 93% of annotated genes and RNA expression for 41% of the probes in intronic and intergenic sequences. Comparison to genome-wide RNA interference data and to gene annotations revealed distinguishable levels of expression for different classes of genes and higher levels of expression for genes with essential cellular functions. Differential splicing was observed in about 40% of predicted genes, and 5440 previously unknown splice forms were detected. Genes within conserved regions of synteny with D. pseudoobscura had highly correlated expression; these regions ranged in length from 10 to 900 kilobase pairs. The expressed intergenic and intronic sequences are more likely to be evolutionarily conserved than nonexpressed ones, and about 15% of them appear to be developmentally regulated. Our results provide a draft expression map for the entire nonrepetitive genome, which reveals a much more extensive and diverse set of expressed sequences than was previously predicted. "
negative,"Medfly-Wolbachia symbiosis: genotype x genotype interactions determine host's life history traits under mass rearing conditions. BACKGROUND: Wolbachia pipientis is a widespread, obligatory intracellular and maternally inherited bacterium, that induces a wide range of reproductive alterations to its hosts. Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) is causing embryonic lethality, the most common of them. Despite that Wolbachia-borne sterility has been proposed as an environmental friendly pest control method (Incompatible Insect Technique, IIT) since 1970s, the fact that Wolbachia modifies important fitness components of its hosts sets severe barriers to IIT implementation. Mass rearing of Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (medfly), is highly optimized given that this pest is a model species regarding the implementation of another sterility based pest control method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We used the medfly-Wolbachia symbiotic association, as a model system, to study the effect of two different Wolbachia strains, on the life history traits of 2 C. capitata lines with different genomic background. RESULTS: Wolbachia effects are regulated by both C. capitata genetic background and the Wolbachia strain. Wolbachia infection reduces fertility rates in both C. capitata genetic backgrounds and shortens the pre-pupa developmental duration in the GSS strain. On the other hand, regardless of the strain of Wolbachia (wCer2, wCer4) infection does not affect either the sex ratio or the longevity of adults. wCer4 infection imposed a reduction in females' fecundity but wCer2 did not. Male mating competitiveness, adults flight ability and longevity under water and food deprivation were affected by both the genetic background of medfly and the strain of Wolbachia (genotype by genotype interaction). CONCLUSION: Wolbachia infection could alter important life history traits of mass-reared C. capitata lines and therefore the response of each genotype on the Wolbachia infection should be considered toward ensuring the productivity of the Wolbachia-infected insects under mass-rearing conditions. "
negative,"RNA Interference in Insect Vectors for Plant Viruses. Insects and other arthropods are the most important vectors of plant pathogens. The majority of plant pathogens are disseminated by arthropod vectors such as aphids, beetles, leafhoppers, planthoppers, thrips and whiteflies. Transmission of plant pathogens and the challenges in managing insect vectors due to insecticide resistance are factors that contribute to major food losses in agriculture. RNA interference (RNAi) was recently suggested as a promising strategy for controlling insect pests, including those that serve as important vectors for plant pathogens. The last decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the functional analysis of insect genes, especially those whose silencing results in mortality or interference with pathogen transmission. The identification of such candidates poses a major challenge for increasing the role of RNAi in pest control. Another challenge is to understand the RNAi machinery in insect cells and whether components that were identified in other organisms are also present in insect. This review will focus on summarizing success cases in which RNAi was used for silencing genes in insect vector for plant pathogens, and will be particularly helpful for vector biologists. "
negative,"Bidirectional promoters of insects: genome-wide comparison, evolutionary implication and influence on gene expression. Bidirectional promoters are widespread in insect genomes. By analyzing 23 insect genomes we show that the frequency of bidirectional gene pairs varies according to genome compactness and density of genes among the species. The density of bidirectional genes expected based on number of genes per megabase of genome explains the observed density suggesting that bidirectional pairing of genes may be due to random event. We identified specific transcription factor binding motifs that are enriched in bidirectional promoters across insect species. Furthermore, we observed that bidirectional promoters may act as transcriptional hotspots in insect genomes where protein coding genes tend to aggregate in significantly biased (p < 0.001) manner compared to unidirectional promoters. Natural selection seems to have an association with the extent of bidirectionality of genes among the species. The rate of non-synonymous-to-synonymous changes (dN / dS) shows a second-order polynomial distribution with bidirectionality between species indicating that bidirectionality is dependent upon evolutionary pressure acting on the genomes. Analysis of genome-wide microarray expression data of multiple insect species suggested that bidirectionality has a similar association with transcriptome variation across species. Furthermore, bidirectional promoters show significant association with correlated expression of the divergent gene pairs depending upon their motif composition. Analysis of gene ontology showed that bidirectional genes tend to have a common association with functions related to ""binding"" (including ion binding, nucleotide binding and protein binding) across genomes. Such functional constraint of bidirectional genes may explain their widespread persistence in genome of diverse insect species. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the common cattle grub, Hypoderma lineatum. The mitochondrial DNA of the cattle grub Hypoderma lineatum (de Villers) (Diptera: Oestridae) was completely sequenced. The entire molecule was 16,354 bp long and presented a heavy bias towards A + T, which accounted for 77.8% of the whole genome. Hypoderma lineatum genes were organized in the same order and orientation as in the mitochondrial genomes available for other species belonging to the Oestroidea superfamily and compared in this study [Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann), Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), Lucilia sericata (Meigen) and Dermatobia hominis (L.)], except for the occurrence of a 102-bp non-coding region partially present in other species. The complete sequence of H. lineatum will represent a useful dataset to evaluate the evolutionary pattern of mtDNA within Oestroidea by using molecular information in diagnostic, taxonomic and evolutionary studies. "
negative,"Transient expression of chimeric CAT genes injected into early embryos of the domesticated silkworm Bombyx mori. In order to establish a transient expression system for genes introduced into early embryos of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we tested various promoters ligated with CAT reporter genes. The embryos into which we injected supercoiled plasmid DNA of pFb(-860 / +10)CAT containing the Bombyx fibroin promoter region ligated to the CAT gene showed a reasonably high CAT activity beginning around 30 h after oviposition. This high activity was observed only when the plasmid was injected before termination of the early nuclear cleavage stage, which was about 8 h after oviposition, but not after this stage. This means that the expression of injected DNA is closely related to the presence of cleavage nuclei in early embryos. Promoters originating from insect genes, like the Bombyx sericin-1 gene, Drosophila hsp70 and Drosophila copia LTR, functioned as strong promoters in the embryos. On the contrary, promoters from mammalian virus genes, such as the SV40 early and Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR genes, functioned as weak promoters. Moreover, linearized DNAs showed no or weak activity of expression in embryos. From these results, we conclude that the silkworm embryo transient expression system is a useful tool for studying the mechanism of regulation of insect genes. "
positive,"Influence of Metarhizium anisopliae (IMI330189) and Mad1 protein on enzymatic activities and Toll-related genes of migratory locust. Efficacy of Metarhizium anisopliae strain (IMI330189) and Mad1 protein alone or in combination by feeding method to overcome immune-related enzymes and Toll-like pathway genes was investigated in migratory locust. M. anisopliae (IMI330189) is a potent and entomopathogenic fungal strain could be effectively used against insect pests. Similarly, Mad1 protein adheres to insect cuticle, causing virulence to insects. We confirmed maximum 55% of mortality when M. anisopliae (IMI330189) and Mad1 was applied in combination. Similarly, increased PO activity was observed in locust with combined dose of Mad1 + IMI330189 whereas PO, POD, and SOD activities reduced using Mad1 independently. Four Toll-like signaling pathway genes (MyD88, Cactus, Pelle, and CaN) were investigated from midgut and body of the migratory locust after 72 h of treatments. Subsequently, the expression of MyD88 in the midgut and body significantly decreased with the application of Mad1 and Mad1 + IMI330189. Performance of these treatments was absolutely non-consistent in both parts of insects. Meanwhile, IMI330189 significantly raised the expression of Cactus in both midgut and body. However, the combined treatment (Mad1 + IMI330189) significantly reduced the Cactus expression in both body parts. Pelle expression was significantly increased in the midgut with the application of independent treatment of Mad1 and IMI330189 whereas the combined treatment (Mad1 + IMI330189) suppressed the Pelle expression in midgut. Its expression level was absolutely higher in body with the application of IMI330189 and Mad1 + IMI330189 only. On the other hand, Mad1 significantly increased the expression of CaN in midgut. However, all three treatments significantly affected and suppressed the expression of CaN gene in body of locust. This shows that the applications of M. anisopliae and Mad1 protein significantly affected Toll signaling pathway genes, which ultimately increased level of susceptibility of locust. However, their effect was significantly different in both parts of locust which recommends that the Toll-related genes are conserved in midgut instead of locust body. "
negative,"RNA interference: Applications and advances in insect toxicology and insect pest management. Since its discovery, RNA interference (RNAi) has revolutionized functional genomic studies due to its sequence-specific nature of post-transcriptional gene silencing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature and summarize the current knowledge and advances in the applications of RNAi technologies in the field of insect toxicology and insect pest management. Many recent studies have focused on identification and validation of the genes encoding insecticide target proteins, such as acetylcholinesterases, ion channels, Bacillus thuringiensis receptors, and other receptors in the nervous system. RNAi technologies have also been widely applied to reveal the role of genes encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, carboxylesterases, and glutathione S-transferases in insecticide detoxification and resistance. More recently, studies have focused on understanding the mechanism of insecticide-mediated up-regulation of detoxification genes in insects. As RNAi has already shown great potentials for insect pest management, many recent studies have also focused on host-induced gene silencing, in which several RNAi-based transgenic plants have been developed and tested as proof of concept for insect pest management. These studies indicate that RNAi is a valuable tool to address various fundamental questions in insect toxicology and may soon become an effective strategy for insect pest management.  "
negative,"The G protein-coupled receptors in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most versatile family of transmembrane receptors in the cell, occupying the highest hierarchical positions in the regulation of many physiological processes. Although they have been extensively studied in a number of model insects, there have been few investigations of GPCRs in large Lepidopterans, such as Bombyx mori, an organism that provides a means to perform detailed tissue expression analyses, which may help to characterize GPCRs and their ligands. In addition, B. mori, also known as the silkworm, is an insect of substantial economic importance, due to its use in silk production and traditional medicines. In this work, we computationally identified 90 putative GPCRs in B. mori, 33 of which represent novel proteins. These GPCRs were annotated and compared with their homologs in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Phylogenetics analyses of the GPCRs from these three insects showed that GPCRs may easily duplicate or disappear during insect evolution, especially in the neuropeptide and protein hormone receptor subfamily. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the quantity and diversity of the stress-tolerance gene, Methuselah, in B. mori, which may be related to its long history of domestication. Moreover, the presence of many Bombyx-specific GPCRs suggests that neither Drosophila nor Anopheles is good representatives for the GPCRs in the Class Insecta. "
positive,"Silencing of ecdysone receptor, insect intestinal mucin and sericotropin genes by bacterially produced double-stranded RNA affects larval growth and development in Plutella xylostella and Helicoverpa armigera. RNA interference mediated gene silencing, which is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), has become a important tool for functional genomics studies in various systems, including insects. Bacterially produced dsRNA employs the use of a bacterial strain lacking in RNaseIII activity and harbouring a vector with dual T7 promoter sites, which allow the production of intact dsRNA molecules. Here, we report an assessment of the functional relevance of the ecdysone receptor, insect intestinal mucin and sericotropin genes through silencing by dsRNA in two lepidopteran insect pests, Helicoverpa armigera and Plutella xylostella, both of which cause serious crop losses. Oral feeding of dsRNA led to significant reduction in transcripts of the target insect genes, which caused significant larval mortality with various moulting anomalies and an overall developmental delay. We also found a significant decrease in reproductive potential in female moths, with a drop in egg laying and compromised egg hatching from treated larvae as compared to controls. dsRNA was stable in the insect gut and was efficiently processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), thus accounting for the phenotypes observed in the present work. The study revealed the importance of these genes in core insect processes, which are essential for insect development and survival. "
positive,"Ran Involved in the Development and Reproduction Is a Potential Target for RNA-Interference-Based Pest Management in Nilaparvata lugens. Ran (RanGTPase) in insects participates in the 20-hydroxyecdysone signal transduction pathway in which downstream genes, FTZ-F1, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) and vitellogenin, are involved. A putative Ran gene (NlRan) was cloned from Nilaparvata lugens, a destructive phloem-feeding pest of rice. NlRan has the typical Ran primary structure features that are conserved in insects. NlRan showed higher mRNA abundance immediately after molting and peaked in newly emerged female adults. Among the examined tissues ovary had the highest transcript level, followed by fat body, midgut and integument, and legs. Three days after dsNlRan injection the NlRan mRNA abundance in the third-, fourth-, and fifth-instar nymphs was decreased by 94.3%, 98.4% and 97.0%, respectively. NlFTZ-F1 expression levels in treated third- and fourth-instar nymphs were reduced by 89.3% and 23.8%, respectively. In contrast, NlKr-h1 mRNA levels were up-regulated by 67.5 and 1.5 folds, respectively. NlRan knockdown significantly decreased the body weights, delayed development, and killed >85% of the nymphs at day seven. Two apparent phenotypic defects were observed: (1) Extended body form, and failed to molt; (2) The cuticle at the notum was split open but cannot completely shed off. The newly emerged female adults from dsNlRan injected fifth-instar nymphs showed lower levels of NlRan and vitellogenin, lower weight gain and honeydew excretion comparing with the blank control, and no offspring. Those results suggest that NlRan encodes a functional protein that was involved in development and reproduction. The study established proof of concept that NlRan could serve as a target for dsRNA-based pesticides for N. lugens control.  "
negative,"Draft genome of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii. The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii Glover is a worldwide agricultural pest that feeds on cotton, melon, and other landscape plants, causing a high level of economic loss. In addition to the common characteristics shared with other aphids, Ap. gossypii has evolved multiple biotypes that present substantial differences in host adaption. These intriguing biological features are of interest from both a fundamental and applied perspective. However, the molecular studies of Ap. gossypii have been restrained by the lack of a reference genome. Furthermore, in order to establish a platform for the development of novel and sustainable control methods, it is necessary to generate genomic resources for Ap. gossypii. Here, we present a 294 Mb draft genome sequence of Ap. gossypii, which consists of 4,724 scaffolds with an N50 size of 438 kb. Compared to other aphid species with published genomes, Ap. gossypii presents the most compact genome size. A total of 14,694 protein-coding genes were predicted and annotated in the consensus gene set, 98.03% of CEGMA genes and 93.5% of BUSCO genes were captured respectively. Genome-wide selection analyses revealed that significantly evolving pathways in the genus Aphis are related to biological processes of detoxification, steroid biosynthesis, and ethylbenzene degradation. The acquisition of the genome of Ap. gossypii makes it possible to understand the molecular mechanism of intricate biological traits of this species, and will further facilitate the study of aphid evolution.

negative,"New views on the Malpighian tubule from post-genomic technologies. Successful insect diversification depends at least in part on the ability to osmoregulate successfully across a broad range of ecological niches. First described in the 17th Century, and Malpighian tubules have been studied physiologically for 70 years. However, our understanding has been revolutionized by the advent of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Such technologies are natural partners with (though do not obligatorily require) model organisms and transgenic technologies. This review describes the recent impact of multi-omic technologies on our understanding or renal function and control in insects. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of homeobox genes from Mesobuthus martensii reveals Hox gene duplication in scorpions. Homeobox genes belong to a large gene group, which encodes the famous DNA-binding homeodomain that plays a key role in development and cellular differentiation during embryogenesis in animals. Here, one hundred forty-nine homeobox genes were identified from the Asian scorpion, Mesobuthus martensii (Chelicerata: Arachnida: Scorpiones: Buthidae) based on our newly assembled genome sequence with approximately 248 × coverage. The identified homeobox genes were categorized into eight classes including 82 families: 67 ANTP class genes, 33 PRD genes, 11 LIM genes, five POU genes, six SINE genes, 14 TALE genes, five CUT genes, two ZF genes and six unclassified genes. Transcriptome data confirmed that more than half of the genes were expressed in adults. The homeobox gene diversity of the eight classes is similar to the previously analyzed Mandibulata arthropods. Interestingly, it is hypothesized that the scorpion M. martensii may have two Hox clusters. The first complete genome-wide analysis of homeobox genes in Chelicerata not only reveals the repertoire of scorpion, arachnid and chelicerate homeobox genes, but also shows some insights into the evolution of arthropod homeobox genes.  "
negative,"Conifer defence against insects: microarray gene expression profiling of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) induced by mechanical wounding or feeding by spruce budworms (Choristoneura occidentalis) or white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi) reveals large-scale changes of the host transcriptome. Conifers are resistant to attack from a large number of potential herbivores or pathogens. Previous molecular and biochemical characterization of selected conifer defence systems support a model of multigenic, constitutive and induced defences that act on invading insects via physical, chemical, biochemical or ecological (multitrophic) mechanisms. However, the genomic foundation of the complex defence and resistance mechanisms of conifers is largely unknown. As part of a genomics strategy to characterize inducible defences and possible resistance mechanisms of conifers against insect herbivory, we developed a cDNA microarray building upon a new spruce (Picea spp.) expressed sequence tag resource. This first-generation spruce cDNA microarray contains 9720 cDNA elements representing c. 5500 unique genes. We used this array to monitor gene expression in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) bark in response to herbivory by white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi, Curculionidae) or wounding, and in young shoot tips in response to western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis, Lepidopterae) feeding. Weevils are stem-boring insects that feed on phloem, while budworms are foliage feeding larvae that consume needles and young shoot tips. Both insect species and wounding treatment caused substantial changes of the host plant transcriptome detected in each case by differential gene expression of several thousand array elements at 1 or 2 d after the onset of treatment. Overall, there was considerable overlap among differentially expressed gene sets from these three stress treatments. Functional classification of the induced transcripts revealed genes with roles in general plant defence, octadecanoid and ethylene signalling, transport, secondary metabolism, and transcriptional regulation. Several genes involved in primary metabolic processes such as photosynthesis were down-regulated upon insect feeding or wounding, fitting with the concept of dynamic resource allocation in plant defence. Refined expression analysis using gene-specific primers and real-time PCR for selected transcripts was in agreement with microarray results for most genes tested. This study provides the first large-scale survey of insect-induced defence transcripts in a gymnosperm and provides a platform for functional investigation of plant-insect interactions in spruce. Induction of spruce genes of octadecanoid and ethylene signalling, terpenoid biosynthesis, and phenolic secondary metabolism are discussed in more detail. "
negative,"Functional validation of target-site resistance mutations against sodium channel blocker insecticides (SCBIs) via molecular modeling and genome engineering in Drosophila. Sodium channel blocker insecticides (SCBIs) like indoxacarb and metaflumizone offer an alternative insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy against several pests that are resistant to other compounds. However, resistance to SCBIs has been reported in several pests, in most cases implicating metabolic resistance mechanisms, although in certain indoxacarb resistant populations of Plutella xylostella and Tuta absoluta, two mutations in the domain IV S6 segment of the voltage-gated sodium channel, F1845Y and V1848I have been identified, and have been postulated through in vitro electrophysiological studies to contribute to target-site resistance. In order to functionally validate in vivo each mutation in the absence of confounding resistance mechanisms, we have employed a CRISPR / Cas9 strategy to generate strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing homozygous F1845Y or V1848I mutations in the para (voltage-gated sodium channel) gene. We performed toxicity bioassays of these strains compared to wild-type controls of the same genetic background. Our results indicate both mutations confer moderate resistance to indoxacarb (RR: 6-10.2), and V1848I to metaflumizone (RR: 8.4). However, F1845Y confers very strong resistance to metaflumizone (RR: >3400). Our molecular modeling studies suggest a steric hindrance mechanism may account for the resistance of both V1848I and F1845Y mutations, whereby introducing larger side chains may inhibit metaflumizone binding. "
negative,"Phylogenomic Analyses Clarify True Species within the Butterfly Genus Speyeria despite Evidence of a Recent Adaptive Radiation. When confronted with an adaptive radiation, considerable evidence is needed to resolve the evolutionary relationships of these closely related lineages. The North American genus Speyeria is one especially challenging radiation of butterflies due to potential signs of incomplete lineage sorting, ongoing hybridization, and similar morphological characters between species. Previous studies have found species to be paraphyletic and have been unable to disentangle taxa, often due to a lack of data and / or incomplete sampling. As a result, Speyeria remains unresolved. To achieve phylogenetic resolution of the genus, we conducted phylogenomic and population genomic analyses of all currently recognized North American Speyeria species, as well as several subspecies, using restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Together, these analyses confirm the 16 canonical species, and clarify many internal relationships. However, a few relationships within Speyeria were poorly supported depending on the evolutionary model applied. This lack of resolution among certain taxa corroborates Speyeria is experiencing an ongoing adaptive radiation, with incomplete lineage sorting and lack of postzygotic reproductive barriers contributing to hybridization and further ambiguity. Given that many Speyeria taxa are under duress from anthropogenic factors, their legal protection must be viewed cautiously and on a case by case basis in order to properly conserve the diversity being generated. "
positive,"CRISPR / Cas9-mediated ebony knockout results in puparium melanism in Spodoptera litura. Insect body pigmentation and coloration are critical to adaption to the environment. To explore the mechanisms that drive pigmentation, we used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing system to target the ebony gene in the non-model insect Spodoptera litura. Ebony is crucial to melanin synthesis in insects. By directly injecting Cas9 messenger RNA and ebony-specific guide RNAs into S. litura embryos, we successfully induced a typical ebony-deficient phenotype of deep coloration of the puparium and induction of melanin formation during the pupal stage. Polymerase chain reaction-based genotype analysis demonstrated that various mutations had occurred at the sites targeted in ebony. Our study clearly demonstrates the function of ebony in the puparium coloration and also provides a potentially useful marker gene for functional studies in S. litura as well as other lepidopteran pests.

negative,"Bioinformatic analysis of the neprilysin (M13) family of peptidases reveals complex evolutionary and functional relationships. BACKGROUND: The neprilysin (M13) family of endopeptidases are zinc-metalloenzymes, the majority of which are type II integral membrane proteins. The best characterised of this family is neprilysin, which has important roles in inactivating signalling peptides involved in modulating neuronal activity, blood pressure and the immune system. Other family members include the endothelin converting enzymes (ECE-1 and ECE-2), which are responsible for the final step in the synthesis of potent vasoconstrictor endothelins. The ECEs, as well as neprilysin, are considered valuable therapeutic targets for treating cardiovascular disease. Other members of the M13 family have not been functionally characterised, but are also likely to have biological roles regulating peptide signalling. The recent sequencing of animal genomes has greatly increased the number of M13 family members in protein databases, information which can be used to reveal evolutionary relationships and to gain insight into conserved biological roles. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis successfully resolved vertebrate M13 peptidases into seven classes, one of which appears to be specific to mammals, and insect genes into five functional classes and a series of expansions, which may include inactive peptidases. Nematode genes primarily resolved into groups containing no other taxa, bar the two nematode genes associated with Drosophila DmeNEP1 and DmeNEP4. This analysis reconstructed only one relationship between chordate and invertebrate clusters, that of the ECE sub-group and the DmeNEP3 related genes. Analysis of amino acid utilisation in the active site of M13 peptidases reveals a basis for their biochemical properties. A relatively invariant S1' subsite gives the majority of M13 peptidases their strong preference for hydrophobic residues in P1' position. The greater variation in the S2' subsite may be instrumental in determining the specificity of M13 peptidases for their substrates and thus allows M13 peptidases to fulfil a broad range of physiological roles. CONCLUSION: The M13 family of peptidases have diversified extensively in all species examined, indicating wide ranging roles in numerous physiological processes. It is predicted that differences in the S2' subsite are fundamental to determining the substrate specificities that facilitate this functional diversity. "
positive,"timeless2 plays an important role in reproduction and circadian rhythms in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. The timeless2 (tim2) gene is an insect orthologue of the mammalian clock gene Timeless (mTim). Although its functional role has been extensively studied in mammals, little is known regarding its role in insects. In the present study, we obtained tim2 cDNA (Gb'tim2) from the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus and characterized its functional role in embryonic development, egg production, and circadian rhythms. Gb'tim2 gave rise to a 1432 amino acid protein, and showed approximately 65% homology to that of Drosophila melanogaster. When treated with parental Gb'tim2RNAi, less than 2% of the treated eggs hatched. On the other hand, control eggs treated with DsRed2RNAi demonstrated a hatching rate of 70%. In most of the Gb'tim2RNAi treated embryos, development was arrested in early stages. Egg production in ovaries of adult virgin females treated with Gb'tim2RNAi was significantly reduced. In addition, while Gb'tim2RNAi crickets exhibited clear locomotor rhythm synchronized with light cycles, their light-on peak was weaker than that of control crickets. Under constant darkness, the activity rhythm of Gb'tim2RNAi crickets was often split into two components running with different periods. Molecular analysis revealed that Gb'tim2RNAi treatment downregulated mRNA levels of Gb'per and Gb'Clk, and enhanced Gb'cyc expression rhythm; no distinct effect was found on Gb'tim expression levels. The change in Gb'per, Gb'Clk and Gb'cyc levels may underlie the altered behavioral rhythms in Gb'tim2RNAi crickets. Both Gb'ClkRNAi and Gb'cycRNAi downregulated Gb'tim2 expression, which suggested that transcription of Gb'tim2 is mediated by Gb'CLK and Gb'CYC through E-box. These results suggested that Gb'tim2 may be involved in both reproduction and circadian rhythm regulation in crickets. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the primary screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the screwworm Cochliomyia hominivorax was determined. This genome is 16,022 bp in size and corresponds to a typical Brachycera mtDNA. A Serine start codon for COI and incomplete termination codons for COII, NADH 5 and NADH 4 genes were described. The nucleotide composition of C. hominivorax mtDNA is 77% AT-rich, reflected in the predominance of AT-rich codons in protein-coding genes. Non-optimal codon usage was commonly observed in C. hominivorax mitochondrial genes. Phylogenetic analysis distributed the Acalypterate species as a monophyletic group and assembled the C. hominivorax (Calyptratae) and the Acalyptratae in a typical Brachycera cluster. The identification of diagnostic restriction sites on the sequenced mitochondrial genome and the correlation with previous RFLP analysis are discussed. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Cervaphis quercus (Insecta: Hemiptera: Aphididae: Greenideinae). The mitochondrial genome of Cervaphis quercus has been sequenced and annotated. The entire genome of 15,272 bp encodes two ribosomal RNA genes (rrnL and rrnS), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 13 protein-coding genes and a control region. The genome has the same gene order as that found in the inferred ancestral insect. Nucleotide composition is highly A+T biased. All protein-coding genes use standard mitochondrial initiation codons. Secondary structure models of the two ribosomal RNA genes of C. quercus are similar to those proposed for other insects. All tRNAs have the classic clover-leaf structure, except for the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of trnS (AGN), which forms a simple loop. The presence of structural elements in the control region is also discussed, with an emphasis on the possible regulation of replication and / or transcription. Comparison with mitochondrial genomes of other aphid species shows their gene arrangements are conserved; however, the variety of repeat regions in species from a different aphid subfamily, Aphidinae, suggests that they resulted from independent evolutionary events. "
negative,"U12-type spliceosomal introns of Insecta. Most of eukaryotic genes are interrupted by introns that need to be removed from pre-mRNAs before they can perform their function. This is done by complex machinery called spliceosome. Many eukaryotes possess two separate spliceosomal systems that process separate sets of introns. The major (U2) spliceosome removes majority of introns, while minute fraction of intron repertoire is processed by the minor (U12) spliceosome. These two populations of introns are called U2-type and U12-type, respectively. The latter fall into two subtypes based on the terminal dinucleotides. The minor spliceosomal system has been lost independently in some lineages, while in some others few U12-type introns persist. We investigated twenty insect genomes in order to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of U12-type introns. Our work confirms dramatic drop of U12-type introns in Diptera, leaving these genomes just with a handful cases. This is mostly the result of intron deletion, but in a number of dipteral cases, minor type introns were switched to a major type, as well. Insect genes that harbor U12-type introns belong to several functional categories among which proteins binding ions and nucleic acids are enriched and these few categories are also overrepresented among these genes that preserved minor type introns in Diptera. "
negative,"The foraging gene, behavioral plasticity, and honeybee division of labor. In recent years, the honeybee has emerged as an excellent model for molecular and genetic studies of complex social behaviors. By using the global gene expression methods as well as the candidate gene approach, it is now possible to link the function of genes to social behaviors. In this paper, I discuss the findings about one such gene, foraging, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The involvement of this gene in regulating division of labor is discussed on two independent, but not mutually exclusive levels; the possible mechanisms for PKG action in regulating behavioral transitions associated with honeybee division of labor, and its possible involvement in the evolution of division of labor in bees. "
negative,"Population Genetic Structure and Breeding Pattern of Cimex hemipterus (F.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) in Malaysia. The surge in tropical bed bug Cimex hemipterus (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) infestations has led to an increase in genomic studies. In this study, the population genetics and breeding patterns of 22 Malaysian populations were analyzed, including genetic differentiation and genetic distance. For seven microsatellite loci, the number of alleles varied from 6 to 14. The allelels per loci contrasted sharply between the overall population and within the populations. The average observed and expected heterozygosity was 0.280 and 0.828 for the overall population and 0.281 and 0.657 among the populations, respectively. Based on polymorphic information criteria, the markers with a value >0.5 were highly polymorphic. In the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the loci of Ch 09ttn, Ch 01dn, and Ch 13dn of the overall population showed signs of a null allele. The stutter peaks caused no scoring errors; large allele dropouts were not detected for any loci; and a correlation imbalance was not indicated. The genetic differentiation among populations was moderate, with a coefficient of genetic differentiation (FST) of 0.144. The bed bug populations showed strong inbreeding, with highly positive coefficients of inbreeding (FIS). The molecular variation attributed to inbreeding was 83% within the populations, compared with 17% among the populations. The admixture individuals in STRUCTURE and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees also indicated weak genetic structure in the geographical populations, suggesting moderate gene flows between populations. Thus, moderately active dispersion and human-mediated transport shaped the genetic structure of C. hemipterus populations in Malaysia. "
positive,Maelstrom is required to position the MTOC in stage 2-6 Drosophila oocytes. The factors that determine intracellular polarity are largely unknown. In Drosophila oocytes one of the earliest polar events is the positioning of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Here we present data that are consistent with the hypothesis that maelstrom is required for posterior positioning of the MTOC. 
negative,"16S rDNA-based phylogeny of non-symbiotic bacteria of Entorno-pathogenic nematodes from infected insect cadavers. Using 16S rDNA gene sequencing technique, three different species of non-symbiotic bacteria of entomopatho-genic nematodes (EPNs) (Steinernema sp. and Heterorhabditis sp.) were isolated and identified from infected insect cadavers {Galleria mellonella larvae) after 48-hour post infections. Sequence similarity analysis revealed that the strains SRK3, SRK4 and SRK5 belong to Ochrobactrum cytisi, Schineria larvae and Ochrobactrum anthropi, respectively. The isolates O. anthropi and S. larvae were found to be associated with Heterorhabditis indica strains BDU-17 and Yer-136, respectively, whereas O. cytisi was associated with Steinernema siamkayai strain BDU-87. Phenotypically, temporal EPN bacteria were fairly related to symbiotic EPN bacteria (Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus genera). The strains SRK3 and SRK5 were phylogeographically similar to several non-symbionts and contaminated EPN bacteria isolated in Germany (LMG3311T) and China (X-14), while the strain SRK4 was identical to the isolates of S. larvae (Ll / 57, Ll / 58, Ll / 68 and L2 / 11) from Wohlfahrtia magnifica in Hungary. The result was further confirmed by RNA secondary structure and minimum energy calculations of aligned sequences. This study suggested that the non-symbionts of these nematodes are phylogeographically diverged in some extent due to phase variation. Therefore, these strains are not host-dependent, but environment-specific isolates. "
negative,"Quantitative trait locus mapping and functional genomics of an organophosphate resistance trait in the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, is an insect pest of corn and population suppression with chemical insecticides is an important management tool. Traits conferring organophosphate insecticide resistance have increased in frequency amongst D. v. virgifera populations, resulting in the reduced efficacy in many corn-growing regions of the USA. We used comparative functional genomic and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approaches to investigate the genetic basis of D. v. virgifera resistance to the organophosphate methyl-parathion. RNA from adult methyl-parathion resistant and susceptible adults was hybridized to 8331 microarray probes. The results predicted that 11 transcripts were significantly up-regulated in resistant phenotypes, with the most significant (fold increases ≥ 2.43) being an α-esterase-like transcript. Differential expression was validated only for the α-esterase (ST020027A20C03), with 11- to 13-fold greater expression in methyl-parathion resistant adults (P < 0.05). Progeny with a segregating methyl-parathion resistance trait were obtained from a reciprocal backcross design. QTL analyses of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data predicted involvement of a single genome interval. These data suggest that a specific carboyxesterase may function in field-evolved corn rootworm resistance to organophosphates, even though direct linkage between the QTL and this locus could not be established. "
negative,"Molecular diversity and phylogenetic analysis of mariner-like transposons in the genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori. Genome-wide screening of mariner-like elements (MLEs) in the silkworm Bombyx mori has revealed the presence of five different types of MLEs (Bmmar1, Bmmar2, Bmmar3, Bmmar4 and Bmmar5). We isolated and characterized sixty copies of the MLEs representing the five Bmmar types. Their nucleotide sequences, nucleotide compositions, deduced transposase sequences, codon preferences, and the copy numbers showed extensive variations. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that Bmmar1, Bmmar2, and Bmmar3 have been in the B. mori genome for a long time, while Bmmar4 is probably a recent invader of the genome. Because of the long-term association of Bmmar1 and Bmmar2 with the genome, highly mutated miniature Bmmar1 and Bmmar2 are widespread in the genome, and the footprints of these elements are also present in different silkworm genes. However, miniature copies of Bmmar4 were not detected. This recently acquired element has very few mutations. None of the characterized copies had functional transposase open reading frames. They essentially exist as fossils in the genome. "
positive,"Tudor knockdown disrupts ovary development in Bactrocera dorsalis. One of the main functions of the piwi-interacting RNA pathway is the post-transcriptional silencing of transposable elements in the germline of many species. In insects, proteins belonging to the Tudor superfamily proteins belonging to the Tudor superfamily play an important role in to play an important role in this mechanism. In this study, we identified the tudor gene in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, investigated the spatiotemporal expressional profile of the gene, and performed a functional analysis using RNA interference. We identified one transcript for a tudor homologue in the B. dorsalis transcriptome, which encodes a protein containing the typical 10 Tudor domains and an Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase delta subunit signature. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identity of this transcript as a tudor homologue in this species. The expression profile indicated a much higher expression in the adult and pupal stages compared to the larval stages (up to a 60-fold increase), and that the gene was mostly expressed in the ovaries, Malpighian tubules and fat body. Finally, gene knockdown of tudor in B. dorsalis led to clearly underdeveloped ovaries in the female adult and reductions in copulation rate and amount of oviposition, indicating its important role in reproduction. The results of this study shed more light on the role of tudor in ovary development and reproduction. "
negative,"Evolutionary dynamics of R2 retroelement and insertion inheritance in the genome of bisexual and parthenogenetic Bacillus rossius populations (Insecta Phasmida). Theoretical and empirical studies have shown differential management of transposable elements in organisms with different reproductive strategies. To investigate this issue, we analysed the R2 retroelement structure and variability in parthenogenetic and bisexual populations of Bacillus rossius stick insects, as well as insertions inheritance in the offspring of parthenogenetic isolates and of crosses. The B. rossius genome hosts a functional (R2Br(fun) ) and a degenerate (R2Br(deg) ) element, their presence correlating with neither reproductive strategies nor population distribution. The median-joining network method indicated that R2Br(fun) duplicates through a multiple source model, while R2Br(deg) is apparently still duplicating via a master gene model. Offspring analyses showed that unisexual and bisexual offspring have a similar number of R2Br-occupied sites. Multiple or recent shifts from gonochoric to parthenogenetic reproduction may explain the observed data. Moreover, insertion frequency spectra show that higher-frequency insertions in unisexual offspring significantly outnumber those in bisexual offspring. This suggests that unisexual offspring eliminate insertions with lower efficiency. A comparison with simulated insertion frequencies shows that inherited insertions in unisexual and bisexual offspring are significantly different from the expectation. On the whole, different mechanisms of R2 elimination in unisexual vs bisexual offspring and a complex interplay between recombination effectiveness, natural selection and time can explain the observed data.  "
negative,"The population genomics of trans-specific inversion polymorphisms in Anopheles gambiae. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae polymorphic chromosomal inversions may play an important role in adaptation to environmental variation. Recently, we used microarray-based divergence mapping combined with targeted resequencing to map nucleotide differentiation between alternative arrangements of the 2La inversion. Here, we applied the same technique to four different polymorphic inversions on the 2R chromosome of An. gambiae. Surprisingly, divergence was much lower between alternative arrangements for all 2R inversions when compared to the 2La inversion. For one of the rearrangements, 2Ru, we successfully mapped a very small region (approximately 100 kb) of elevated divergence. For the other three rearrangements, we did not identify any regions of significantly high divergence, despite ample independent evidence from natural populations of geographic clines and seasonal cycling, and stable heterotic polymorphisms in laboratory populations. If these inversions are the targets of selection as hypothesized, we suggest that divergence between rearrangements may have escaped detection due to retained ancestral polymorphism in the case of the youngest 2R rearrangements and to extensive gene flux in the older 2R inversion systems that segregate in both An. gambiae and its sibling species An. arabiensis. "
positive,"Identification and functional analysis of a novel chorion protein essential for egg maturation in the brown planthopper. In insect eggs, the chorion has the essential function of protecting the embryo from external agents during development while allowing gas exchange for respiration. In this study, we found a novel gene, Nilaparvata lugens chorion protein (NlChP), that is involved in chorion formation in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. NlChP was highly expressed in the follicular cells of female adult brown planthoppers. Knockdown of NlChP resulted in oocyte malformation and the inability to perform oviposition, and electron microscopy showed that the malformed oocytes had thin and rough endochorion layers compared to the control group. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the eggshell components revealed four unique peptides that were matched to NlChP. Our results demonstrate that NlChP is a novel chorion protein essential for egg maturation in N. lugens, a hemipteran insect with telotrophic meroistic ovaries. NlChP may be a potential target in RNA interference-based insect pest management. "
negative,"Global phylogenetics of Diuraphis noxia (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an invasive aphid species: evidence for multiple invasions into North America. The Russian wheat aphid, Diruaphis noxia (Kudjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is globally one of the most devastating pests of bread wheat, Tritium aestivum L., durum wheat, Triticum turgidum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L. Several sources of D. noxia resistance have been incorporated in commercial wheat and barley genotypes, but up to eight virulent biotypes, defined based on their ability to damage different wheat and barley genotypes, now occur across the western United States since the first appearance of D. noxia in North America in 1986. Critical to the study of D. noxia and other invasive species is an understanding of the number and origin of invasions that have occurred, as well as the rate or potential of postinvasion adaptation and geographic range expansion. The goal of this study was to determine whether D. noxia biotypes are by-products of a single invasion or multiple invasions into North America. We used the genome-wide technique of amplified fragment length polymorphisms, in combination with 22 collections of D. noxia from around the world, to assess this question, as well as patterns of genetic divergence. We found multiple lines of evidence that there have been at least two D. noxia invasions of different origin into North America, each resulting in subsequent postinvasion diversification that has since yielded multiple biotypes. "
negative,"Poplar defense against insects: genome analysis, full-length cDNA cloning, and transcriptome and protein analysis of the poplar Kunitz-type protease inhibitor family. *Kunitz protease inhibitors (KPIs) feature prominently in poplar defense responses against insects. The increasing availability of genomics resources enabled a comprehensive analysis of the poplar (p)KPI family. *Using genome analysis, expressed sequence tag (EST) mining and full-length (FL)cDNA cloning we established an inventory and phylogeny of pKPIs. Microarray and real-time PCR analyses were used to profile pKPI gene expression following real or simulated insect attack. Proteomics of insect midgut content was used to monitor stability of pKPI protein. *We identified 31 pKPIs in the genome and validated gene models by EST mining and cloning of 41 unique FLcDNAs. Genome organization of the pKPI family, with six poplar-specific subfamilies, suggests that tandem duplications have played a major role in its expansion. pKPIs are expressed throughout the plant and many are strongly induced by insect attack, although insect-specific signals seem initially to suppress the tree pKPI response. We found substantial peptide coverage for a potentially intact pKPI protein in insect midgut after eating poplar leaves. *These results highlight the complexity of an important defense gene family in poplar with regard to gene family size, differential constitutive and insect-induced gene expression, and resilience of at least one pKPI protein to digestion by herbivores. "
negative,"Purification of triosephosphate isomerase and isolation of its gene from the mosquito Culex tarsalis. The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) was purified to homogeneity from the mosquito Culex tarsalis. Anti-C. tarsalis TPI antibodies cross-reacted with TPIs from other organisms but bands on western blots were most intense with proteins from closely related Dipterans. Using a degenerate primer corresponding to the amino-terminal sequence of the protein in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a cDNA corresponding to the TPI gene (Tpi) was isolated and sequenced. Subsequently, a genomic sequence including 305 bp to the 5'-end of the coding sequence was obtained. Comparison of C. tarsalis Tpi to that of Drosophila melanogaster revealed that although the two genes had little similarity in the intron and 5' flanking sequences, they were highly similar (73% identity) in their coding sequence. The rate of synonymous substitution in insect genes may be slower than that of vertebrates, but the nonsynonymous substitution rate, and hence the rate of TPI evolution, appears to be faster in insects than in vertebrates. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar galleriae strain HD-29, a typical strain of commercial biopesticide. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar galleriae is highly toxic to Lepidoptera insect pests, and has been widely used as Bt biopesticide in many countries. Here we reported the complete genome of strain HD-29, a standard serotype strain in galleriae serovariety. More than previous work reported, it harbors ten plasmids, and three large ones carry eight insecticidal protein genes (cry1Aa, cry1Ac, cry1Ca, cry1Da, cry1Ia, cry2Ab, cry9Ea and vip3Aa) and an intact zwittermicin A biosynthetic gene cluster.  "
positive,"The histone deacetylase NlHDAC1 regulates both female and male fertility in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Histone acetylation is a specific type of chromatin modification that serves as a key regulatory mechanism for many cellular processes in mammals. However, little is known about its biological function in invertebrates. Here, we identified 12 members of histone deacetylases (NlHDACs) in the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens. RNAi-mediated silencing assay showed that NlHdac1, NlHdac3 and NlHdac4 played critical roles in female fertility via regulating ovary maturation or ovipositor development. Silencing of NlHdac1 substantially increased acetylation level of histones H3 and H4 in ovaries, indicating NlHDAC1 is the main histone deacetylase in ovaries of BPH. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that knockdown of NlHdac1 impaired ovary development via multiple signalling pathways including the TOR pathway. Acoustic recording showed that males with NlHdac1 knockdown failed to make courtship songs, and thus were unacceptable to wild-type females, resulting in unfertilized eggs. Competition mating assay showed that wild-type females overwhelmingly preferred to mate with control males over NlHdac1-knockdown males. These findings improve our understanding of reproductive strategies controlled by HDACs in insects and provide a potential target for pest control. "
negative,"cDNA sequence, mRNA expression and genomic DNA of trypsinogen from the indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella. Trypsin-like enzymes are major insect gut enzymes that digest dietary proteins and proteolytically activate insecticidal proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Resistance to Bt in a strain of the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella, was linked to the absence of a major trypsin-like proteinase (Oppert et al., 1997). In this study, trypsin-like proteinases, cDNA sequences, mRNA expression levels and genomic DNAs from Bt-susceptible and -resistant strains of the Indianmeal moth were compared. Proteinase activity blots of gut extracts indicated that the susceptible strain had two major trypsin-like proteinases, whereas the resistant strain had only one. Several trypsinogen-like cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced from cDNA libraries of both strains using a probe deduced from a conserved sequence for a serine proteinase active site. cDNAs of 852 nucleotides from the susceptible strain and 848 nucleotides from the resistant strain contained an open reading frame of 783 nucleotides which encoded a 261-amino acid trypsinogen-like protein. There was a single silent nucleotide difference between the two cDNAs in the open reading frame and the predicted amino acid sequence from the cDNA clones was most similar to sequences of trypsin-like proteinases from the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, and the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The encoded protein included amino acid sequence motifs of serine proteinase active sites, conserved cysteine residues, and both zymogen activation and signal peptides. Northern blotting analysis showed no major difference between the two strains in mRNA expression in fourth-instar larvae, indicating that transcription was similar in the strains. Southern blotting analysis revealed that the restriction sites for the trypsinogen genes from the susceptible and resistant strains were different. Based on an enzyme size comparison, the cDNA isolated in this study corresponded to the gene for the smaller of two trypsin-like proteinases, which is found in both the Bt-susceptible and -resistant strains of the Indianmeal moth. The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database (accession numbers AF064525 for the RC688 strain and AF064526 for HD198). "
negative,"Genome evolution in the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies sheds light on their divergence. Whiteflies are important agricultural insect pests, whose evolutionary success is related to a long-term association with a bacterial endosymbiont, Candidatus Portiera aleyrodidarum. To completely characterize this endosymbiont clade, we sequenced the genomes of three new Portiera strains covering the two extant whitefly subfamilies. Using endosymbiont and mitochondrial sequences we estimated the divergence dates in the clade and used these values to understand the molecular evolution of the endosymbiont coding sequences. Portiera genomes were maintained almost completely stable in gene order and gene content during more than 125 Myr of evolution, except in the Bemisia tabaci lineage. The ancestor had already lost the genetic information transfer autonomy but was able to participate in the synthesis of all essential amino acids and carotenoids. The time of divergence of the B. tabaci complex was much more recent than previous estimations. The recent divergence of biotypes B (MEAM1 species) and Q (MED species) suggests that they still could be considered strains of the same species. We have estimated the rates of evolution of Portiera genes, synonymous and nonsynonymous, and have detected significant differences among-lineages, with most Portiera lineages evolving very slowly. Although the nonsynonymous rates were much smaller than the synonymous, the genomic dN / dS ratios were similar, discarding selection as the driver of among-lineage variation. We suggest variation in mutation rate and generation time as the responsible factors. In conclusion, the slow evolutionary rates of Portiera may have contributed to its long-term association with whiteflies, avoiding its replacement by a novel and more efficient endosymbiont.  "
negative,"Genome-Wide Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Genes Associated with Meiotic Drive System of Aedes aegypti. Aedes aegypti is an important mosquito vector of several arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and Chikungunya, which cause significant human morbidity and mortality globally. In certain populations of this mosquito, a native meiotic drive system causes abnormal spermatogenesis that results in highly male-biased progenies from some matings. Although the basic genetics and cytogenetics of the drive mechanism were elucidated, very little is known on a transcriptome level about how the meiotic drive phenotype is expressed in individual males. To address this question, we conducted a whole-genome microarray expression study of testes from a meiotic-drive-carrying strain (T37) in comparison with testes from a non-drive-carrying strain (RED). Based on bioinformatics analyses of the microarray data, we identified 209 genes associated with the meiotic drive phenotype that were significantly differentially expressed between the two strains. K-means cluster analysis revealed nine clusters, in which genes upregulated in T37 testes were assigned to five clusters and genes downregulated in T37 testes were assigned to four clusters. Our data further revealed that genes related to protein translation, phosphorylation, and binding, as well as to G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and peptidase activities, are differentially upregulated in testes from males with the meiotic drive genotype. Based on pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes, it was observed that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis pathway may play a role in the meiotic drive system. Overall, this investigation enhances our understanding of whole-genome gene expression associated with the meiotic drive system in Ae. aegypti. "
negative,"Me and we: the interplay between individual and group behavioral variation in social collectives. In social insects, substantial behavioral variation exists among individuals and across colonies. Here, we discuss the role of individual variation in shaping behavioral tendencies of social groups, and highlight gaps in our knowledge about the role of the social group in modulating individual behavioral tendencies. We summarize our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underpinning these processes, and describe the use of genomic tools to better understand the influence of social context on individuals. We discuss rapid collective phasic transitions, in which a group of individuals engages in a common novel behavior together, as a potentially highly informative model system in which to comprehensively investigate the interplay between individual and group variation. "
negative,"A non-autonomous insect piggyBac transposable element is mobile in tobacco. The piggyBac transposable element, originally isolated from a virus in an insect cell line, is a valuable molecular tool for transgenesis and mutagenesis of invertebrates. For heterologous transgenesis in a variety of mammals, transfer of the piggyBac transposable element from an ectopic plasmid only requires expression of piggyBac transposase. To determine if piggyBac could function in dicotyledonous plants, a two-element system was developed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) to test for transposable element excision and insertion. The first transgenic line constitutively expressed piggyBac transposase, while the second transgenic line contained at least two non-autonomous piggyBac transposable elements. Progeny from crosses of the two transgenic lines was analyzed for piggyBac excision and transposition. Several progeny displayed excision events, and all the sequenced excision sites exhibited evidence of the precise excision mechanism characteristic of piggyBac transposase. Two unique transposition insertion events were identified that each included diagnostic duplication of the target site. These data indicate that piggyBac transposase is active in a dicotyledonous plant, although at a low frequency.  "
negative,"The evolutionary development of plant-feeding insects and their nutritional endosymbionts. Herbivorous insects have evolved diverse mechanisms enabling them to feed on plants with suboptimal nutrient availability. Low nutrient availability negatively impacts insect herbivore development and fitness. To overcome this obstacle numerous insect lineages have evolved intimate associations with nutritional endosymbionts. This is especially true for insects that specialize on nitrogen-poor substrates, as these insects are highly dependent on intracellular symbionts to provide nitrogen lacking in their insect host's diet. Emerging evidence in these systems suggest that the symbiont's and / or the insect's biosynthetic pathways are dynamically regulated throughout the insect's development to potentially cope with the insect's changing nutritional demands. In this review, we evaluate the evolutionary development of symbiotic insect cells (bacteriocytes) by comparing and contrasting genes and mechanisms involved in maintaining and regulating the nutritional symbiosis throughout insect development in a diversity of insect herbivore-endosymbiont associations. With new advances in genome sequencing and functional genomics, we evaluate to what extent nutritional symbioses are shaped by (i) the regulation of symbiont titer, (ii) the regulation of insect symbiosis genes, and (iii) the regulation of symbiont genes. We discuss how important these mechanisms are for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins across insect life stages in divergent insect-symbiont systems. We conclude by suggesting future directions of research to further elucidate the evolutionary development of bacteriocytes and the impact of these nutritional symbioses on insect-plant interactions.

negative,"Rhabdovirus-like endogenous viral elements in the genome of Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells are actively transcribed: Implications for adventitious virus detection. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) cell lines are used to produce several biologicals for human and veterinary use. Recently, it was discovered that all tested Sf cell lines are persistently infected with Sf-rhabdovirus, a novel rhabdovirus. As part of an effort to search for other adventitious viruses, we searched the Sf cell genome and transcriptome for sequences related to Sf-rhabdovirus. To our surprise, we found intact Sf-rhabdovirus N- and P-like ORFs, and partial Sf-rhabdovirus G- and L-like ORFs. The transcribed and genomic sequences matched, indicating the transcripts were derived from the genomic sequences. These appear to be endogenous viral elements (EVEs), which result from the integration of partial viral genetic material into the host cell genome. It is theoretically impossible for the Sf-rhabdovirus-like EVEs to produce infectious virus particles as 1) they are disseminated across 4 genomic loci, 2) the G and L ORFs are incomplete, and 3) the M ORF is missing. Our finding of transcribed virus-like sequences in Sf cells underscores that MPS-based searches for adventitious viruses in cell substrates used to manufacture biologics should take into account both genomic and transcribed sequences to facilitate the identification of transcribed EVE's, and to avoid false positive detection of replication-competent adventitious viruses.

negative,"The genomic response to 20-hydroxyecdysone at the onset of Drosophila metamorphosis. BACKGROUND: The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) triggers the major developmental transitions in Drosophila, including molting and metamorphosis, and provides a model system for defining the developmental and molecular mechanisms of steroid signaling. 20E acts via a heterodimer of two nuclear receptors, the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle, to directly regulate target gene transcription. RESULTS: Here we identify the genomic transcriptional response to 20E as well as those genes that are dependent on EcR for their proper regulation. We show that genes regulated by 20E, and dependent on EcR, account for many transcripts that are significantly up- or downregulated at puparium formation. We provide evidence that 20E and EcR participate in the regulation of genes involved in metabolism, stress, and immunity at the onset of metamorphosis. We also present an initial characterization of a 20E primary-response regulatory gene identified in this study, brain tumor (brat), showing that brat mutations lead to defects during metamorphosis and changes in the expression of key 20E-regulated genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides a genome-wide basis for understanding how 20E and its receptor control metamorphosis, as well as a foundation for functional genomic analysis of key regulatory genes in the 20E signaling pathway during insect development. "
negative,"Transcripts analysis of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae induced in vitro with insect haemolymph. Steinernema carpocapsae is an insect parasitic nematode widely used in pest control programs. The efficacy of this nematode in controlling insects has been found to be related to the pathogenicity of the infective stage. In order to study the parasitic mechanisms exhibited by this parasite, a cDNA library of the induced S. carpocapsae parasitic phase was generated. A total of 2500 clones were sequenced and 2180 high-quality ESTs were obtained from this library. Cluster analysis generated a total of 1592 unique sequences including 1393 singletons. About 63% of the unique sequences had significant hits (e< / =1e-05) to the non-redundant protein database. The remaining sequences most likely represent putative novel protein coding genes. Comparative analysis identified 377 homologs in C. elegans, 431 in C. briggsae and 75 in other nematodes. Classification of the predicted proteins revealed involvement in diverse cellular, metabolic and extracellular functions. One hundred and nineteen clusters were predicted to encode putative secreted proteins such as proteases, proteases inhibitors, lectins, saposin-like proteins, acetylcholinesterase, anti-oxidants, and heat-shock proteins, which can possibly have host interactions. This dataset provides a basis for genomic studies towards a better understanding of the events that occur in the parasitic process of this entomopathogenic nematode, including invasion of the insect haemocoelium, adaptations to insect innate immunity and stress responses, and production of virulence factors. The identification of key genes in the parasitic process provides useful tools for the improvement of S. carpocapsae as a biological agent. "
negative,"Chromosomal inversions and ecotypic differentiation in Anopheles gambiae: the perspective from whole-genome sequencing. The molecular mechanisms and genetic architecture that facilitate adaptive radiation of lineages remain elusive. Polymorphic chromosomal inversions, due to their recombination-reducing effect, are proposed instruments of ecotypic differentiation. Here, we study an ecologically diversifying lineage of Anopheles gambiae, known as the Bamako chromosomal form based on its unique complement of three chromosomal inversions, to explore the impact of these inversions on ecotypic differentiation. We used pooled and individual genome sequencing of Bamako, typical (non-Bamako) An. gambiae and the sister species Anopheles coluzzii to investigate evolutionary relationships and genomewide patterns of nucleotide diversity and differentiation among lineages. Despite extensive shared polymorphism and limited differentiation from the other taxa, Bamako clusters apart from the other taxa, and forms a maximally supported clade in neighbour-joining trees based on whole-genome data (including inversions) or solely on collinear regions. Nevertheless, FST outlier analysis reveals that the majority of differentiated regions between Bamako and typical An. gambiae are located inside chromosomal inversions, consistent with their role in the ecological isolation of Bamako. Exceptionally differentiated genomic regions were enriched for genes implicated in nervous system development and signalling. Candidate genes associated with a selective sweep unique to Bamako contain substitutions not observed in sympatric samples of the other taxa, and several insecticide resistance gene alleles shared between Bamako and other taxa segregate at sharply different frequencies in these samples. Bamako represents a useful window into the initial stages of ecological and genomic differentiation from sympatric populations in this important group of malaria vectors. "
negative,"Insilco Prediction and Characterization of microRNAs from Oncopeltus fasciatus (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) Genome. For studies on functional genomics, small RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), have emerged as a hot topic due to their importance in cellular and developmental processes. Identification of insect miRNAs largely depends on the availability of genomic sequences in the public domain. The large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus (Dallas) is a hemimetabolous insect which has become a model hemipteran system for various molecular studies. In this study, we identified 96 candidate mature miRNAs from O. fasciatus genome using a blast search with the previously reported animal miRNAs. The secondary structure of predicted miRNA sequences was determined online using ""mfold"" web server and verified by calculating the minimal free energy index (MFEI). Six miRNAs let-7e, miR-133c, miR-219b, mir-466d, mir-669f, and mir-669l are reported for the first time in Insecta. Comparison of O. fasciatus mir-2 and mir-71 family clusters to those of diverse insect species showed that they are highly conserved. The phylogenetic analysis of miRNAs revealed the evolutionary relationship of conserved miRNAs of O. fasciatus with other insect species. Using a classical rule-based algorithm method, we predicted the possible targets of the new miRNAs. Our study not only identified the list of miRNAs in O. fasciatus but also provides a basic platform for developing novel pest management strategies based on artificial miRNAs.  "
negative,"Evolutionary divergence of mitochondrial genomes in two Tetranychus species distributed across different climates. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) can be under selection, whereas the selective regimes shaping mitogenome evolution remain largely unclear. To test for mitogenome evolution in relation to the climate adaptation, we explored mtDNA variation in two spider mite (Tetranychus) species that distribute across different climates. We sequenced 26 complete mitogenomes of Tetranychus truncates, which occurs in both warm and cold regions, and nine complete mitogenomes of Tetranychus pueraricola, which is restricted to warm regions. Patterns of evolution in the two species' mitogenomes were compared through a series of dN  / dS methods and physicochemical profiles of amino acid replacements. We found that: (1) the mitogenomes of both species were under widespread purifying selection; (2) elevated directional adaptive selection was observed in the T. truncatus mitogenome, perhaps linked to the cold climates adaptation of T. truncatus; and (3) the strength of selection varied across genes, and diversifying positive selection detected on ND4 and ATP6 pointed to their crucial roles during adaptation to different climatic conditions. This study gained insight into the mitogenome evolution in relation to the climate adaptation. "
negative,"Novel cuticular proteins revealed by the honey bee genome. With the completion of the honey bee genome project, a transition is now occurring from the acquisition of gene sequence to understanding the role and context of gene products within the genome. Here we annotated and characterised a cluster of three genes in a GC-rich 11 kb genomic region on the linkage group 4 encoding highly hydrophobic polypeptides (named apidermins; APD 1-3) containing both sequence motifs characteristic of cuticular proteins and distinctly novel features. Five amino acids, Ala, Gly, Leu, Pro and Val, account for 74-86% of their respective sequences with Ala being the most abundant residue (at least 30% of each peptide). A conserved tetra-peptide AAPA / V is found in all three proteins, but none has the 'R and R' signature implicated in chitin binding. Two proteins, APD-1 and APD-2, contain an arginine-rich motif RERR in short non-hydrophobic stretches near the N-terminal of mature proteins and in both proteins tryptophan is the C-terminal residue. All three genes are spliced and highly expressed in a defined spatio-temporal pattern. apd-1 is expressed in the exoskeletal epidermis, but only during a restricted period of a few days of late pupal and early adult life when the cuticle becomes dark. APD2 appears to be a protein of ""internal"" cuticles and is expressed in the tracheas, oesophagus and stomach, and also in the embryo. The expression of apd-3 partly overlaps with both apd-1 and apd-3, but apd-3 also is uniquely associated with non-pigmented cuticles such as the eye cover and external cuticle of white pupae. This study expands the collection of genes encoding cuticular proteins by three novel and well characterised members. "
negative,"Accessing a Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance Gene in Bread Wheat by Long-Read Technologies. Russian wheat aphid (RWA) ( Kurdjumov) is a serious invasive pest of small-grain cereals and many grass species. An efficient strategy to defy aphid attacks is to identify sources of natural resistance and transfer resistance genes into susceptible crop cultivars. Revealing the genes helps understand plant defense mechanisms and engineer plants with durable resistance to the pest. To date, more than 15 RWA resistance genes have been identified in wheat ( L.) but none of them has been cloned. Previously, we genetically mapped the RWA resistance gene into an interval of 0.83 cM on the short arm of chromosome 7D and spanned it with five bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. Here, we used a targeted strategy combining traditional approaches toward gene cloning (genetic mapping and sequencing of BAC clones) with novel technologies, including optical mapping and long-read nanopore sequencing. The latter, with reads spanning the entire length of a BAC insert, enabled us to assemble the whole region, a task that was not achievable with short reads. Long-read optical mapping validated the DNA sequence in the interval and revealed a difference in the locus organization between resistant and susceptible genotypes. The complete and accurate sequence of the region facilitated the identification of new markers and precise annotation of the interval, revealing six high-confidence genes. Identification of as the most likely candidate opens an avenue for its validation through functional genomics approaches. "
positive,"Cloning and characterization of a Gasp homolog from the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, and its putative role in cuticle formation. Proteins that are capable of binding chitin play essential roles in the synthesis and structural integrity of the insect cuticle and peritrophic matrix. In the course of developing expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries for the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, we identified an abundant cDNA encoding a homolog of the Drosophila ""gasp"" gene (Gene Analogous to Small Peritrophins). For the present work, we undertook the characterization of this new homolog, CfGasp, in an effort to identify its role during larval development. As shown for DmGasp, the C. fumiferana homolog was found to contain three type-2 chitin-binding domains (CBDs), which were also found in Gasp orthologs retrieved from GenBank. In a phylogenetic analysis, these Gasp proteins formed a tight cluster, distinct from the midgut-specific peritrophins with which they share the cysteine-containing CBDs so far considered absent from cuticular proteins. However, unlike what has been shown for peritrophins, CfGasp transcript levels were low in larval midguts and most abundant in epidermis, while they were low in trachea and ovaries. Transcript levels increased during larval molts in a pattern similar to that observed for exocuticular proteins in other insects. In addition, the recombinant protein was shown to be capable of binding chitin. Altogether, these results suggest a structural role for CfGasp in exocuticle formation. "
negative,"Description of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) mitochondrial genome and comparative mitogenomics of Aphididae (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha). The complete mitochondrial genome of the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura), a major agricultural pest in the world, is described for the first time, which consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, as well as a large repeat region between tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe, and an AT-rich control region. The 17,954 bp mtgenome is the largest reported from the family Aphididae, and its gene order follows the ancestral insect mtgenome except for the repeat region, which contains a 195 bp unit repeated 11.9 times, representing the highest reported repeats among the known aphid mtgenomes to date. A new molecular phylogeny of Aphidae is reconstructed based on all available aphid mtgenomes, and it is shown that the mtgenome data can robustly resolve relationships at the subfamily level, but do not have sufficient phylogenetic information to resolve deep relationships. A phylogeny-based comparative analysis of mtgenomes has been performed to investigate the evolution of the repeat region between tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe. So far, among aphids, 13 species are known to have this repeat region of variable lengths, and a phylogenetic analysis of the repeat region shows that a large proportion of the sequences are conserved across the phylogeny, suggesting that the repeat region evolved in the most recent common ancestor of Aphidinae and Eriosomatinae, and that it has gone through numerous episodes of lineage-specific losses and expansions. Combined together, this study provides novel insights into how the repeat regions have evolved within aphids. "
positive,"Silencing the HaAK gene by transgenic plant-mediated RNAi impairs larval growth of Helicoverpa armigera. Insect pests have caused noticeable economic losses in agriculture, and the heavy use of insecticide to control pests not only brings the threats of insecticide resistance but also causes the great pollution to foods and the environment. Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been is currently developed for protection against insect pests. In this study, we used this technology to silence the arginine kinase (AK) gene of Helicoverpa armigera (HaAK), encoding a phosphotransferase that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism in invertebrate. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants producing HaAK dsRNA were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The maximal mortality rate of 55% was reached when H. armigera first-instar larvae were fed with transgenic plant leaves for 3 days, which was dramatically higher than the 18% mortality recorded in the control group. Moreover, the ingestion of transgenic plants significantly retarded larval growth, and the transcript levels of HaAK were also knocked down by up to 52%. The feeding bioassays further indicated that the inhibition efficiency was correlated with the integrity and concentration of the produced HaAK dsRNA in transgenic plants. These results strongly show that the resistance to H. armigera was improved in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that the RNAi targeting of AK has the potential for the control of insect pests.  "
negative,"Genomic analysis of a cypovirus isolated from the eucalyptus brown looper, Thyrinteina arnobia (Stoll, 1782) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). The eucalyptus brown looper, Thyrinteina arnobia (Stoll, 1782) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), is the main lepidopteran defoliator of eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Outbreaks of this insect pest are common in Brazil and can affect the productivity of planted forests severely. T. arnobia caterpillars from a laboratory colony with viral infection symptoms were analyzed by electron microscopy that revealed polyhedral occlusion bodies (OBs) with several icosahedral virus particles embedded. Analysis of its genetic material showed ten segments of dsRNA, which confirmed this virus as a possible member of the genus Cypovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed its close relationship with other isolates of Cypovirus 14 species and according to these results we proposed the name Thyrinteina arnobia cypovirus 14 (TharCPV-14) for this new virus isolate. Further research will be necessary in order to analyze the potential of this virus as a biopesticide. "
negative,"Nucleotide sequences of genome segments S6, S7 and S10 of Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus 1. The nucleotide sequences of genome segments S6, S7 and S10 of Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus 1 Hunan I (DpCPV-HN(I)) and DpCPV-HN(I)-Se(3) (DpCPV-HN(I) passed three times in Spodoptera exigua) were determined. Segment S10 was 944 nucleotides in length and encoded a polyhedrin of 248 amino acids (28,439 Da). Only two nucleotide mutations were found between DpCPV-HN(I) S10 and DpCPV-HN(I)-Se3 S10, and the deduced amino acid sequences of the polyhedrin proteins were identical. Segment S7, 1 501 nucleotides, encoded a protein of 448 amino acids ( approximately 50 kDa; p50). Thirty-one nucleotide mutations were found between DpCPV-HN(I) S7 and DpCPV-HN(I)-Se3 S7, but these resulted in only four amino acid changes. DpCPV-HN(I) S6 encoded a protein of 561 amino acids (63,688 Da; p64). The amino acid sequence of p64, had a high leucine content (10%), and contained a leucine zipper motif and one ATP / GTP-binding site motif. "
negative,"Population genomics reveals evolution and variation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the human and insects gut. The quest to discover the variety of ecological niches inhabited by Saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to research in areas as diverse as wineries, oak trees and insect guts. The discovery of fungal communities in the human gastrointestinal tract suggested the host's gut as a potential reservoir for yeast adaptation. Here, we report the existence of yeast populations associated with the human gut (HG) that differ from those isolated from other human body sites. Phylogenetic analysis on 12 microsatellite loci and 1715 combined CDSs from whole-genome sequencing revealed three subclusters of HG strains with further evidence of clonal colonization within the host's gut. The presence of such subclusters was supported by other genomic features, such as copy number variation, absence / introgressions of CDSs and relative polymorphism frequency. Functional analysis of CDSs specific of the different subclusters suggested possible alterations in cell wall composition and sporulation features. The phenotypic analysis combined with immunological profiling of these strains further showed that sporulation was related with strain-specific genomic characteristics in the immune recognition pattern. We conclude that both genetic and environmental factors involved in cell wall remodelling and sporulation are the main drivers of adaptation in S. cerevisiae populations in the human gut. "
negative,"Origanum vulgare Terpenoids Induce Oxidative Stress and Reduce the Feeding Activity of Spodoptera littoralis. Terpenoids are toxic compounds produced by plants as a defense strategy against insect herbivores. We tested the effect of Origanum vulgare terpenoids on the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis and the response of the plant to herbivory. Terpenoids were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS and quantitative gene expression (qPCR) was evaluated on selected plant genes involved in both terpene biosynthesis. The insect detoxification response to terpenes was evaluated by monitoring antioxidant enzymes activity and expression of insect genes involved in terpene detoxification. O. vulgare terpenoid biosynthesis and gene expression was modulated by S. littoralis feeding. The herbivore-induced increased level of terpenoids (particularly carvacrol and p-cymene) interacted with the herbivore by decreasing larval survival and growth rate. The assimilation by S. littoralis of more than 50% of ingested terpenes correlated with the possible toxic effects of O. vulgare terpenoids. In choice test experiments, carvacrol and γ-terpinene mediated the larval feeding preferences, wherease the prolonged feeding on O. vulgare terpenoids (particularly on γ-terpinene) exerted relevant antinutritional effects on larvae. S. littoralis was found to react to O. vulgare terpenoids by increasing its antioxidant enzymes activities and gene expression, although this was not sufficient to sustain the toxicity of O. vulgare terpenoids. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in the sexual stage of the insect pathogenic fungus Cordyceps militaris. DNA methylation is a basic epigenetic mechanism found in eukaryotes, but its patterns and roles vary significantly among diverse taxa. In fungi, DNA methylation has various effects on diverse biological processes. However, its function in the sexual development of fungi remains unclear. Cordyceps militaris, readily performs sexual reproduction and thus provides a remarkably rich model for understanding epigenetic processes in sexual development. Here, we surveyed the methylome of C. militaris at single-base resolution to assess DNA methylation patterns during sexual development using genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq). The results showed that approximately 0.4 % of cytosines are methylated, similar to the DNA methylation level (0.39 %) during asexual development. Importantly, we found that DNA methylation in the fungi undergoes global reprogramming during fungal development. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis indicated that the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have no correlation with the genes that have roles during fungal sexual development in C. militaris. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of DNA methylation in the sexual development of C. militaris, which will contribute to future investigations of epigenetics in fungi. "
negative,"Discovery of genes related to formothion resistance in oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) by a constrained functional genomics analysis. Artificial selection can provide insights into how insecticide resistance mechanisms evolve in populations. The underlying basis of such phenomena can involve complex interactions of multiple genes, and the resolution of this complexity first necessitates confirmation that specific genes are involved in resistance mechanisms. Here, we used a novel approach invoking a constrained RNA sequencing analysis to refine the discovery of specific genes involved in insecticide resistance. Specifically, for gene discovery, an additional constraint was added to the traditional comparisons of susceptible vs. resistant flies by the incorporation of a line in which insecticide susceptibility was 'recovered' within a resistant line by the removal of insecticide stress. In our analysis, the criterion for the classification of any gene as related to insecticide resistance was based on evidence for differential expression in the resistant line as compared with both the susceptible and recovered lines. The incorporation of this additional constraint reduced the number of differentially expressed genes putatively involved in resistance to 464, compared with more than 1000 that had been identified previously using this same species. In addition, our analysis identified several key genes involved in metabolic detoxification processes that showed up-regulated expression. Furthermore, the involvement of acetylcholinesterase, a known target for modification in insecticide resistance, was associated with three key nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions within our data. In conclusion, the incorporation of an additional constraint using a 'recovered' line for gene discovery provides a higher degree of confidence in genes identified to be involved in insecticide resistance phenomena.  "
positive,"Complexities in Bombyx germ cell formation process revealed by Bm-nosO (a Bombyx homolog of nanos) knockout. Inheritance (sequestration of a localized determinant: germplasm) and zygotic induction are two modes of metazoan primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. vasa and nanos homologs are evolutionarily conserved germline marker genes that have been used to examine the ontogeny of germ cells in various animals. In the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori, although the lack of vasa homolog (BmVLG) protein localization as well as microscopic observation suggested the lack of germplasm, classical embryo manipulation studies and the localization pattern of Bm-nosO (one of the four nanos genes in Bombyx) maternal mRNA in the egg raised the possibility that an inheritance mode is operating in Bombyx. Here, we generated Bm-nosO knockouts to examine whether the localized mRNA acts as a localized germ cell determinant. Contrary to our expectations, Bm-nosO knockout lines could be established. However, these lines frequently produced abnormal eggs, which failed to hatch, to various extent depending on the individuals. We also found that Bm-nosO positively regulated BmVLG expression at least during embryonic stage, directly or indirectly, indicating that these genes were on the same developmental pathway for germ cell formation in Bombyx. These results suggest that these conserved genes are concerned with stable germ cell production. On the other hand, from the aspect of BmVLG as a PGC marker, we showed that maternal Bm-nosO product(s) as well as early zygotic Bm-nosO activity were redundantly involved in PGC specification; elimination of both maternal and zygotic gene activities (as in knockout lines) resulted in the apparent lack of PGCs, indicating that an inheritance mechanism indeed operates in Bombyx. This, however, together with the fact that germ cells are produced at all in Bm-nosO knockout lines, also suggests the possibility that, in Bombyx, not only this inheritance mechanism but also an inductive mechanism acts in concert to form germ cells or that loss of early PGCs are compensated for by germline regeneration: mechanisms that could enable the evolution of preformation. Thus, Bombyx could serve as an important organism in understanding the evolution of germ cell formation mechanisms; transition between preformation and inductive modes. "
negative,"Isolation of cDNA clones coding for mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA from the crustacean Artemia. cDNA clones coding for Artemia mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) have been isolated. The clones cover from nucleotide 650 of the RNA molecule to its 3' end. The comparison of Artemia sequence with both vertebrate and invertebrate mitochondrial 16S rRNA sequences has shown the existence of regions of high similarity between them. A model for the secondary structure of the 3' half of Artemia mitochondrial 16S rRNA is proposed. The size of the rRNA molecule has been estimated at 1.35 kb. Despite the similarity of the Artemia gene to insect rRNA in size, sequence and secondary structure, the G + C content of the Artemia gene (42%) is closer to that of mammals than to the insect genes. The number of mitochondria in Artemia has been estimated at 1500 per diploid genome in the cyst and 4000 in the nauplius. In contrast, the amount of mt 16S rRNA is constant at all stages of Artemia development. "
negative,"Trait mapping in diverse arthropods by bulked segregant analysis. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) is a cross-based method for genetic mapping in sexually reproducing organisms. The method's use of bulked (pooled) samples markedly reduces the genotyping effort associated with traditional linkage mapping studies. Further, it can be applied to species with life histories or physical attributes (as for micro-insects) that render genetic mapping with other methods impractical. Recent studies in both insects and mites have revealed that advanced BSA experimental designs can resolve causal loci to narrow genomic intervals, facilitating follow-up investigations. As high-quality genomes become more widely available, BSA methods are poised to become an increasingly important tool for the rapid mapping of both monogenic and polygenic traits in diverse arthropod species. "
negative,"Genome sequence of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Aphids are important agricultural pests and also biological models for studies of insect-plant interactions, symbiosis, virus vectoring, and the developmental causes of extreme phenotypic plasticity. Here we present the 464 Mb draft genome assembly of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. This first published whole genome sequence of a basal hemimetabolous insect provides an outgroup to the multiple published genomes of holometabolous insects. Pea aphids are host-plant specialists, they can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and they have coevolved with an obligate bacterial symbiont. Here we highlight findings from whole genome analysis that may be related to these unusual biological features. These findings include discovery of extensive gene duplication in more than 2000 gene families as well as loss of evolutionarily conserved genes. Gene family expansions relative to other published genomes include genes involved in chromatin modification, miRNA synthesis, and sugar transport. Gene losses include genes central to the IMD immune pathway, selenoprotein utilization, purine salvage, and the entire urea cycle. The pea aphid genome reveals that only a limited number of genes have been acquired from bacteria; thus the reduced gene count of Buchnera does not reflect gene transfer to the host genome. The inventory of metabolic genes in the pea aphid genome suggests that there is extensive metabolite exchange between the aphid and Buchnera, including sharing of amino acid biosynthesis between the aphid and Buchnera. The pea aphid genome provides a foundation for post-genomic studies of fundamental biological questions and applied agricultural problems. "
negative,"Exogenous RNAs for Gene Regulation and Plant Resistance. Recent investigations documented that plants can uptake and process externally applied double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to silence important genes of plant pathogenic viruses, fungi, or insects. The exogenously applied RNAs spread locally and systemically, move into the pathogens, and induce RNA interference-mediated plant pathogen resistance. Recent findings also provided examples of plant transgene and endogene post-transcriptional down-regulation by complementary dsRNAs or siRNAs applied onto the plant surfaces. Understanding the plant perception and processing of exogenous RNAs could result in the development of novel biotechnological approaches for crop protection. This review summarizes and discusses the emerging studies reporting on exogenous RNA applications for down-regulation of essential fungal and insect genes, targeting of plant viruses, or suppression of plant transgenes and endogenes for increased resistance and changed phenotypes. We also analyze the current understanding of dsRNA uptake mechanisms and dsRNA stability in plant environments. "
negative,PCR primers for the amplification of four insect mitochondrial gene fragments. Insect mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) analysis is a powerful tool for the study of population genetics and phylogenetics. In the past few years primer sequences for the PCR amplification of various insect mtDNA genes have been published. The objectives of this study were (1) present new primer sequences for six insect mitochondrial genes and (2) test primers designed in our laboratory and some previously published primers on a wide range of insects to determine if amplification of the target fragment could be obtained. The primers for the amplification of the two ribosomal RNA gene (16S and 12S rRNA) fragments are universal for insects and related groups; the primers for NADH5 and NADH4 dehydrogenase gene fragments and cytochrome c oxidase I gene fragment are applicable broadly. 
positive,"Characterization of NlHox3, an essential gene for embryonic development in Nilaparvata lugens. Hox genes encode transcriptional regulatory proteins that control axial patterning in all bilaterians. The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is a destructive insect pest of rice plants in Asian countries. During analysis of the N. lugens transcriptome, we identified a Hox3-like gene (NlHox3) that was highly and specifically expressed in the embryonic stage. We performed functional analysis on the gene to identify its roles in embryonic development and its potential use as a target in RNA interference (RNAi) based pest control. The sequence analysis showed that NlHox3 was homologous to the Hox3 gene and was most closely related with zen of Drosophila. There were no significant differences in oviposition between the treated and control females after injecting double-stranded RNA of NlHox3 (dsNlHox3) into newly emerged female adult BPHs; however, there was a significant difference in the hatchability of those eggs laid, which no egg from the treated group hatched normally. Injecting female adult BPHs with dsNlHox3 led to necrosis of these offspring embryos, with eye reversal and undeveloped organs, suggesting that NlHox3 was an essential gene for embryonic development and might be a potential target for RNAi-based control of this insect pest. "
negative,"Proteomic analysis of insect molting fluid with a focus on enzymes involved in chitin degradation. Cuticular chitin degradation is extremely important for insect growth and development, which has not been fully understood thus far. One obstacle to understanding this mechanism is the lack of a systematic analysis of the chitinolytic enzymes involved in cuticular chitin degradation. In this study, we used the silkmoth Bombyx mori as a model organism and compared proteomic analyses for larval-pupal (L-P) and pupal-adult (P-A) molting fluids using tandem mass tag quantitative mass spectrometry. There were 195 proteins identified from both L-P and P-A molting fluids. A total of 170 out of 195 proteins were deduced to be secretory and were enriched for GO terms associated with chitin metabolism and proteolysis by using AgriGO. Although the chitinolytic enzymes are encoded by many insect genes, the proteomics analysis unexpectedly showed that only four chitinolytic enzymes with the combination ""211"" were abundant in both molting fluids, namely, two insect GH18 Chitinase family members (ChtI and ChtII), one bacterial-type GH18 Chitinase (Chi-h), and one insect GH20 hexosaminidase (Hex1). A tissue-specific and stage-specific gene expression pattern verified that the ""211"" enzymes are involved in cuticular chitin degradation. This work first demonstrates that specific enzymes ChtI, ChtII, Chi-h, and Hex1 can be assigned to cuticular chitin degradation.  "
positive,"B96Bom encodes a Bombyx mori tyramine receptor negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. A cDNA encoding a biogenic amine receptor (B96Bom) was isolated from silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae, and the ligand response of the receptor stably expressed in HEK-293 cells was examined. Tyramine (TA) at 0.1-100 micro m reduced forskolin (10 micro m)-stimulated intracellular cAMP levels by approximately 40%. The inhibitory effect of TA at 1 micro m was abolished by yohimbine and chlorpromazine (each 10 micro m). Although octopamine (OA) also reduced the cAMP levels, the potency was at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of TA. Furthermore, unlabelled TA (IC50 = 5.2 nm) inhibited specific [3H]TA binding to the membranes of B96Bom-transfected HEK-293 cells more potently than did OA (IC50 = 1.4 micro m) and dopamine (IC50 = 1.7 micro m). Taken together with the result of phylogenetic analysis, these findings indicate that the B96Bom receptor is a B. mori TA receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The use of this expression system should facilitate physiological studies of TA receptors as well as structure-activity studies of TA receptor ligands. "
positive,"Decapentaplegic function in wing vein development and wing morph transformation in brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene plays a variety of roles in diverse cellular and molecular processes of the growth and development. In insects, dpp is mainly required for dorsal-ventral patterning and appendage formation. The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a major pest of rice, possesses two distinct wing morphs described as long-winged (LW) and short-winged (SW) morphs. With our lab-maintained stable strains of LW and SW BPH, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to research the functions of N. lugens dpp (Nldpp) on wing development. Silencing of Nldpp in the SW strain led to the significant lengthening of the forewing, while Nldpp-knockdown in the LW strain resulted in distorted wings. Moreover, knockdown of Nldpp caused the complete absence of wing veins. During the development of wing-pads, the Nldpp abundance in the terga of the SW strain was significantly higher than that of the LW strain. Through controlling the direction of wing morph transformation, we found that the expression level of Nldpp increased in the NlInR1-knockdown BPH (tending to SW) and abundance of Nldpp declined after dsNlInR2 injection (tending to LW). Our results showed that Nldpp is mainly responsible for the formation and development of veins in BPH. Also, Nldpp can be regulated by NlInR1 / 2 and participate in the wing morph transformation. "
negative,"Detection of Bacillus cereus virulence factors in commercial products of Bacillus thuringiensis and expression of diarrheal enterotoxins in a target insect. We examined isolates from 4 commercial bioinsecticides based on different strains of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies (kurstaki, israelensis, aizawai, and tenebrionis) for the presence of genes encoding proteins with known enterotoxigenicity (nhe, hbl, cytk, ces) and various other putative virulence genes (piplc, sph, bceT, entFM, entS, entT). The piplc and bceT sequences were present in all the isolates; sph was found in aizawai and israelensis; entFM only in israelensis; and entS in kurstaki, israelensis, and tenebrionis. Our results corroborate previous findings that isolates used in commercial products contain all nhe and hbl component genes but not the ces gene. We ascertained that the cytK gene present in the kurstaki-, israelensis-, and aizawai-based products belongs to the cytK-2 type and not the more toxigenic cytK-1 variant originally isolated from enterotoxic Bacillus cereus. We provide the first evidence that hemolytic (hblA) and nonhemolytic (nheA, nheB, nheC) enterotoxin genes are expressed during septicemia in a target insect. This opens the door for their possible participation in pathogenesis in target insects. If enterotoxins do not contribute to bacterial pathogenesis in target insects, their genes could be deleted from commercial production strains to pre-empt perceptions of public health risks. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of odorant-binding proteins and chemosensory proteins in the sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) of insects are thought to play roles in olfactory recognition affecting host choice, copulation, reproduction and other behaviors. Previous descriptions of OBPs and CSPs in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci often provided no or incomplete genetic information. In this study, we present a genome-wide and transcriptome-wide investigation of the OBPs and CSPs in B. tabaci MEAM1 (Middle East-Asia Minor1 species). Eight OBP and 19 CSP genes were identified that covered all previous sequences. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the CSP genes had a lineage-specific expansion (BtabBCSP1, BtabBCSP3, BtabBCSP13, BtabBCSP17, BtabBCSP18 and BtabBCSP19). Expression profiling of OBPs and CSPs by transcriptome sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that expression patterns differed among developmental stages of B. tabaci MEAM1. Five OBP genes and 11 CSP genes significantly differed between males and females; four of the 19 CSP genes were highly expressed in adults, while two were highly expressed in nymphs. The expression profiles of the OBP and CSP genes in different tissues of B. tabaci MEAM1 adults were analyzed by qPCR. Four OBP genes found in B. tabaci MEAM1 were highly expressed in the head. Conversely, only two CSPs were enriched in the head, while the other six CSPs were specifically expressed in other tissues. Our results provide a foundation for future research on OBPs and CSPs in B. tabaci. "
positive,"The expression of Spodoptera exigua P450 and UGT genes: tissue specificity and response to insecticides. Cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) as phase I and phase II metabolism enzymes, respectively, play vital roles in the breakdown of endobiotics and xenobiotics. Insects can increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress from xenobiotics including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms for insecticide detoxification in Spodoptera exigua remain elusive, and the genes conferring insecticide metabolisms in this species are less well reported. In this study, 68 P450 and 32 UGT genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed gene expansions in CYP3 and CYP4 clans of P450 genes and UGT33 family of this pest. P450 and UGT genes exhibited specific tissue expression patterns. Insecticide treatments in fat body cells of S. exigua revealed that the expression levels of P450 and UGT genes were significantly influenced by challenges of abamectin, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorantraniliprole, metaflumizone and indoxacarb. Multiple genes for detoxification were affected in expression levels after insecticide exposures. The results demonstrated that lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorantraniliprole, metaflumizone and indoxacarb induced similar responses in the expression of P450 and UGT genes in fat body cells; eight P450 genes and four UGT genes were co-up-regulated significantly, and no or only a few CYP / UGT genes were down-regulated significantly by these four insecticides. However, abamectin triggered a distinct response for P450 and UGT gene expression; more P450 and UGT genes were down-regulated by abamectin than by the other four compounds. In conclusion, P450 and UGT genes from S. exigua were identified, and different responses to abamectin suggest a different mechanism for insecticide detoxification. "
positive,"Post-embryonic functions of HSP90 in Tribolium castaneum include the regulation of compound eye development. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) belongs to a family of conserved chaperons with multiple roles in stress adaptation and development, including spermatogenesis, oogenesis and embryogenesis in insects. In the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we found that HSP90 is transiently upregulated during larval development, in prepupae, in female pupae and in adults, suggesting multiple post-embryonic roles. We found that silencing HSP90 expression by RNA interference was lethal within 10 days at all developmental stages. Titration experiments revealed that larvae were more susceptible than pupae or beetles. Interestingly, HSP90 silencing in final instar larvae resulted in abnormal pupal phenotypes lacking compound eyes and exhibiting prepupal features, suggesting developmental arrest at the prepupal stage. Our results suggest that HSP90 functions can be expanded beyond the known ones in insect embryogenesis to include roles in post-embryonic development such as the regulation of compound eye development. "
negative,"An Arabidopsis gene homologous to mammalian and insect genes encoding the largest proteasome subunit. A gene encoding a protein with extensive homology to the largest subunit of the multicatalytic proteinase complex (proteasome) has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene, referred to as AtPSM30, is entirely encompassed within a previously characterized radiation-induced deletion, which may thus provide the first example of a proteasome null mutation in a higher eukaryote. However, the growth rate and fertility of Arabidopsis plants do not appear to be significantly affected by this mutation, even though disruption experiments in yeast have shown that most proteasome subunits are essential. Analysis of mRNA levels in developing seedlings and mature plants indicates that expression of AtPSM30 is differentially regulated during development and is slightly induced in response to stress, as has been observed for proteasome genes in yeast, Drosophila, and mammals. Southern blot analysis indicates that the Arabidopsis genome contains numerous sequences closely related to AtPSM30, consistent with recent reports of at least two other proteasome genes in Arabidopsis. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences for all proteasome genes reported to date suggests that multiple proteasome subunits evolved in eukaryotes prior to the divergence of plants and animals. "
positive,"Structure and expression of the silk adhesive protein Ser2 in Bombyx mori. Sericins are soluble silk components encoded in Bombyx mori by three genes, of which Ser1 and Ser3 have been characterized. The Ser1 and Ser3 proteins were shown to appear later in the last larval instar as the major sericins of cocoon silk. These proteins are, however, virtually absent in the highly adhesive silk spun prior to cocoon spinning, when the larvae construct a loose scaffold for cocoon attachment. We show here that the silk-gland lumen of the feeding last instar larvae contains two abundant adhesive proteins of 230 kDa and 120 kDa that were identified as products of the Ser2 gene. We also describe the sequence, exon-intron structure, alternative splicing and deduced translation products of this gene in the Daizo p50 strain of B. mori. Two mRNAs of 5.7 and 3.1 kb are generated by alternative splicing of the largest exon. The predicted mature proteins contain 1740 and 882 amino acid residues. The repetitive amino acid sequence encoded by exons 9a and 9b is apparently responsible for the adhesiveness of Ser2 products. It has a similar periodic arrangement of motifs containing lysine and proline as a highly adhesive protein of the mussel Mytilus edulis. "
positive,"CNAct-1 gene is differentially expressed in the subtropical mosquito Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae), the primary West Nile Virus vector in Florida. Analysis of differentially expressed genes is a common molecular biological tool to investigate changes in mosquito genes after a bloodmeal or parasite exposure. We report here the characterization of a differentially expressed actin gene, CNAct-1, from the subtropical mosquito, Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae). The CNAct-1 genomic clone is 1.525 kb, includes one 66-bp intron, and a 328-bp 3'-untranslated region. The 376-amino acid putative translation product shares high similarity with muscle-specific actin proteins from other insects, including Culex pipiens pipiens L., Aedes aegypti (L.), Anopheles gambiae Giles and Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). CNAct-1 is expressed in second and third instars, late pupae, and adult females and males. Interestingly, Cx. nigripalpus actin was highly expressed in female mosquito midgut tissue isolated 6-12 h after ingestion of a bloodmeal. This expression profile indicates a unique function for CNAct-1 in midgut processes that are initiated after blood ingestion. "
negative,"Use of electroporation as an option to transform the horn fly, Haematobia irritans: a species recalcitrant to microinjection. The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is a serious pest of cattle in North America. The control of horn flies has primarily relied on insecticides. However, the heavy use of insecticides has led to the development of insecticide resistance in horn flies. Novel methods to control horn flies are greatly needed. Transgenic technology is an effective tool to genetically modify insects and may lead to novel methods of pest control based on genomic approaches. Here we report a piggyBac-mediated transformation of the horn fly via electroporation. Transformation with a DsRed fluorescent marker protein coding region was verified by PCR analysis of individual fly bodies and pupal cases and sequencing of PCR products. However, Southern blot analysis failed to indicate the DsRed gene was integrated into the horn fly genome. Thus, the electroporation protocol may have caused the DsRed gene to be integrated into bacterial symbionts of the horn fly.  "
negative,"Genome sequence of Aedes aegypti, a major arbovirus vector. We present a draft sequence of the genome of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for yellow fever and dengue fever, which at approximately 1376 million base pairs is about 5 times the size of the genome of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Nearly 50% of the Ae. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements. These contribute to a factor of approximately 4 to 6 increase in average gene length and in sizes of intergenic regions relative to An. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Nonetheless, chromosomal synteny is generally maintained among all three insects, although conservation of orthologous gene order is higher (by a factor of approximately 2) between the mosquito species than between either of them and the fruit fly. An increase in genes encoding odorant binding, cytochrome P450, and cuticle domains relative to An. gambiae suggests that members of these protein families underpin some of the biological differences between the two mosquito species. "
negative,"DBM-DB: the diamondback moth genome database. The diamondback moth Genome Database (DBM-DB) is a central online repository for storing and integrating genomic data of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.). It provides comprehensive search tools and downloadable datasets for scientists to study comparative genomics, biological interpretation and gene annotation of this insect pest. DBM-DB contains assembled transcriptome datasets from multiple DBM strains and developmental stages, and the annotated genome of P. xylostella (version 2). We have also integrated publically available ESTs from NCBI and a putative gene set from a second DBM genome (KONAGbase) to enable users to compare different gene models. DBM-DB was developed with the capacity to incorporate future data resources, and will serve as a long-term and open-access database that can be conveniently used for research on the biology, distribution and evolution of DBM. This resource aims to help reduce the impact DBM has on agriculture using genomic and molecular tools. Database URL: http: /  / iae.fafu.edu.cn / DBM /   "
negative,"A full-length cDNA resource for the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Large collections of full-length cDNAs are important resources for genome annotation and functional genomics. We report the creation of a collection of 50 599 full-length cDNA clones from the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Sequencing from 5' and 3' ends of the clones generated 97 828 high-quality expressed sequence tags, representing approximately 9000 genes. These sequences were imported to AphidBase and are shown to play crucial roles in both automatic gene prediction and manual annotation. Our detailed analyses demonstrated that the full-length cDNAs can further improve gene models and can even identify novel genes that are not included in the current version of the official gene set. This full-length cDNA collection can be utilized for a wide variety of functional studies, serving as a community resource for the study of the functional genomics of the pea aphid. "
negative,"Genome-block expression-assisted association studies discover malaria resistance genes in Anopheles gambiae. The malaria parasite-resistance island (PRI) of the African mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae, was mapped to five genomic regions containing 80 genes, using coexpression patterns of genomic blocks. High-throughput sequencing identified 347 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms within these genes in mosquitoes from malaria-endemic areas in Kenya. Direct association studies between nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and Plasmodium falciparum infection identified three naturally occurring genetic variations in each of three genes (An. gambiae adenosine deaminase, fibrinogen-related protein 30, and fibrinogen-related protein 1) that were associated significantly with parasite infection. A role for these genes in the resistance phenotype was confirmed by RNA interference knockdown assays. Silencing fibrinogen-related protein 30 increased parasite infection significantly, whereas ablation of fibrinogen-related protein 1 transcripts resulted in mosquitoes nearly free of parasites. The discovered genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are anticipated to be useful in the development of tools for malaria control in endemic areas in Africa.  "
negative,"Genome-wide identification, characterization and evolution of cuticular protein genes in the malaria vector Anopheles sinensis (Diptera: Culicidae). Thirteen cuticular protein (CP) families have been recognized in arthropods. In this study, 250 Anopheles sinensis CP genes were identified and named based on genome and transcriptome sequences. They were classified into 10 families based on motifs and phylogenetic analyses. In 11 other insect species, nine had CP numbers > 150 while Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum had CP numbers less than 52. The CPs of eight species occupied > 1.4% of the total genomic gene number, whereas in three species the CPs occupied < 1%. The phylogenies for each CP family in An. sinensis were constructed and discussed. The 250 CPs each had 1-8 exons with 144 CPs (57.6%) having two exons. The intron length ranged from 66-3888 bp with 174 introns (54.0%) being 66-100 bp long. Except for two CPs on two contigs, 248 CPs were mapped onto 28 scaffolds with 136 genes (54.4%) restricted to five scaffolds. A total of 107 CPs were clustered and located at 27 loci. The CPR family had the conserved motif GSYSLVEPDGTVRTV. The RR-1 subfamily had an additional 21 amino acid (aa) motifs with the YVADENGF sequence that is common in insects. The RR-2 subfamily had an additional 50 aa motifs with two additional regions RDGDVVKG and G-x(3)-VV. A comparison with 115 orthologous counterparts of An. gambiae CPs suggested purifying selection for all of these genes. This study provides basic information useful for further studies on biological functions of An. sinensis CPs as well as for comparative genomics of insect CPs. "
negative,"Signatures of host / symbiont genome coevolution in insect nutritional endosymbioses. The role of symbiosis in bacterial symbiont genome evolution is well understood, yet the ways that symbiosis shapes host genomes or more particularly, host / symbiont genome coevolution in the holobiont is only now being revealed. Here, we identify three coevolutionary signatures that characterize holobiont genomes. The first signature, host / symbiont collaboration, arises when completion of essential pathways requires host / endosymbiont genome complementarity. Metabolic collaboration has evolved numerous times in the pathways of amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis. Here, we highlight collaboration in branched-chain amino acid and pantothenate (vitamin B5) biosynthesis. The second coevolutionary signature is acquisition, referring to the observation that holobiont genomes acquire novel genetic material through various means, including gene duplication, lateral gene transfer from bacteria that are not their current obligate symbionts, and full or partial endosymbiont replacement. The third signature, constraint, introduces the idea that holobiont genome evolution is constrained by the processes governing symbiont genome evolution. In addition, we propose that collaboration is constrained by the expression profile of the cell lineage from which endosymbiont-containing host cells, called bacteriocytes, are derived. In particular, we propose that such differences in bacteriocyte cell lineage may explain differences in patterns of host / endosymbiont metabolic collaboration between the sap-feeding suborders Sternorrhyncha and Auchenorrhynca. Finally, we review recent studies at the frontier of symbiosis research that are applying functional genomic approaches to characterization of the developmental and cellular mechanisms of host / endosymbiont integration, work that heralds a new era in symbiosis research.  "
negative,"OMIGA: Optimized Maker-Based Insect Genome Annotation. Insects are one of the largest classes of animals on Earth and constitute more than half of all living species. The i5k initiative has begun sequencing of more than 5,000 insect genomes, which should greatly help in exploring insect resource and pest control. Insect genome annotation remains challenging because many insects have high levels of heterozygosity. To improve the quality of insect genome annotation, we developed a pipeline, named Optimized Maker-Based Insect Genome Annotation (OMIGA), to predict protein-coding genes from insect genomes. We first mapped RNA-Seq reads to genomic scaffolds to determine transcribed regions using Bowtie, and the putative transcripts were assembled using Cufflink. We then selected highly reliable transcripts with intact coding sequences to train de novo gene prediction software, including Augustus. The re-trained software was used to predict genes from insect genomes. Exonerate was used to refine gene structure and to determine near exact exon / intron boundary in the genome. Finally, we used the software Maker to integrate data from RNA-Seq, de novo gene prediction, and protein alignment to produce an official gene set. The OMIGA pipeline was used to annotate the draft genome of an important insect pest, Chilo suppressalis, yielding 12,548 genes. Different strategies were compared, which demonstrated that OMIGA had the best performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive pipeline for identifying genes in insect genomes that can be widely used to improve the annotation quality in insects. OMIGA is provided at http: /  / ento.njau.edu.cn / omiga.html .  "
positive,"Characterization and functional analysis of hsp18.3 gene in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are diverse and mainly function as molecular chaperones to protect organisms and cells from various stresses. In this study, hsp18.3, one Tribolium castaneum species-specific shsp, has been identified. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction illustrated that Tchsp18.3 is expressed in all developmental stages, and is highly expressed at early pupal and late adult stages, while it is highly expressed in ovary and fat body at the adult period. Moreover, it was up-regulated 4532 ± 396-fold in response to enhanced heat stress but not to cold stress; meanwhile the lifespan of adults in ds-Tchsp18.3 group reduced by 15.8% from control group under starvation. Laval RNA interference (RNAi) of Tchsp18.3 caused 86.1% ± 4.5% arrested pupal eclosion and revealed that Tchsp18.3 played an important role in insect development. In addition, parental RNAi of Tchsp18.3 reduced the oviposition amount by 94.7%. These results suggest that Tchsp18.3 is not only essential for the resistance to heat and starvation stress, but also is critical for normal development and reproduction in T. castaneum. "
negative,"Genome size diversity in the family Drosophilidae. Flies in the genus Drosophila have been the dominant model organisms in genetics for over a century and, with a dozen complete sequences now available, continue as such in modern comparative genomics. Surprisingly, estimates of genome size for this genus have been relatively sparse, covering less than 2% of species. Here, best practice flow cytometric genome size estimates are reported for both male and female flies from 67 species from six genera in the family Drosophilidae, including 55 species from the genus Drosophila. Direct and phylogenetically corrected correlation analyses indicate that genome size is positively correlated with temperature-controlled duration of development in Drosophila, and there is indication that genome size may be positively related to body size and sperm length in this genus. These findings may provide some explanation for the streamlined genomes found in these insects, and complement recent work demonstrating possible selective constraints on further deletion of noncoding DNA. "
negative,"Analyses of P-like transposable element sequences from the genome of Anopheles gambiae. We have identified 50 P element-homologous sequences in the genome of Anopheles gambiae by performing homology searches against the public genome database of A. gambiae using the canonical P element from Drosophila melanogaster as a query sequence. While most of these sequences belong to P subfamilies previously described from anopheline mosquitoes, at least four new subfamilies were identified. One of these A. gambiae P elements, which we termed AgPLS, was analysed in detail. AgPLS consists of three exons and does not have inverted terminal repeats. This element retains several of the structural features of other P-encoded peptides, such as motifs involved in DNA-protein and protein-protein interaction, and a motif involved in GTP utilization. Strong sequence and structural similarity to functional P elements, a number of nonsynonymous substitutions that is smaller than that of synonymous substitutions and the presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggest that the A. gambiae elements may retain the capacity for transposition or its repression. These sequences seem to be most closely related to P elements described from Musca domestica and Lucilia cuprina, the only P element hosts known outside the family Drosophilidae. "
positive,"Modular cis-regulatory logic of yellow gene expression in silkmoth larvae. Colour patterns in butterflies and moths are crucial traits for adaptation. Previous investigations have highlighted genes responsible for pigmentation (ie yellow and ebony). However, the mechanisms by which these genes are regulated in lepidopteran insects remain poorly understood. To elucidate this, molecular studies involving dipterans have largely analysed the cis-regulatory regions of pigmentation genes and have revealed cis-regulatory modularity. Here, we used well-developed transgenic techniques in Bombyx mori and demonstrated that cis-regulatory modularity controls tissue-specific expression of the yellow gene. We first identified which body parts are regulated by the yellow gene via black pigmentation. We then isolated three discrete regulatory elements driving tissue-specific gene expression in three regions of B. mori larvae. Finally, we found that there is no apparent sequence conservation of cis-regulatory regions between B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster, and no expression driven by the regulatory regions of one species when introduced into the other species. Therefore, the trans-regulatory landscapes of the yellow gene differ significantly between the two taxa. The results of this study confirm that lepidopteran species use cis-regulatory modules to control gene expression related to pigmentation, and represent a powerful cadre of transgenic tools for studying evolutionary developmental mechanisms. "
positive,"The regulation of three new members of the cytochrome P450 CYP6 family and their promoters in the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii by plant allelochemicals. BACKGROUND: The expression of P450 genes in insects can be induced by plant allelochemicals. To understand the induction mechanisms, we measured the expression profiles of three P450 genes and their promoter activities under the induction of plant allelochemicals. RESULTS: The inducible expression of CYP6CY19 was the highest among three genes, followed by those of CYP6CY22 and CYP6DA1. The regions from -687 to +586 bp of CYP6DA1, from -666 to +140 bp of CYP6CY19 and from -530 to +218 bp of CYP6CY22 were essential for basal transcriptional activity. The cis-elements for plant allelochemicals induction were identified between -193 and +56 bp of CYP6DA1, between -157 and +140 bp of CYP6CY19 and between -108 and +218 bp of CYP6CY22. These promoter regions were found to contain a potential aryl hydrocarbon receptor element binding site with a conservative sequence motif 5'-C / TAC / ANCA / CA-3'. All these four plant allelochemicals were able to induce the expression of these P450 genes. Tannic acid had a better inductive effect than other three plant allelochemicals. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the plant allelochemical responsive cis-elements. This provides further research targets aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms of P450 genes expression and their interactions with plant allelochemicals in insect pests. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Analysis of the extent of synteny and conservation in the gene order in aphids: A first glimpse from the Aphis glycines genome. In the last decade several insect genomes have been sequenced, but for most the chromosomal mapping of the identified scaffolds / annotated genes is not available. The lack of this information makes it difficult to analyse various genetic aspects, including the presence of genome rearrangements and the extent of synteny within and across species. We mapped five multigenic DNA families (major and minor rDNAs, histone gene cluster, esterases and carotenoid desaturases) and seven scaffolds corresponding to 9 Mb of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, genome and identified loci spanning the four soybean aphid chromosomes. A comparative analysis of the localization of the annotated A. glycines genes with respect to the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, and the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, evidenced a lower degree of synteny between the two aphid species than in the aphid-fly comparison. Only 1.4 genes per syntenic block were observed in aphids in contrast to 2.3 genes per block in flies. This higher chromosomal rearrangement rate in aphids could be explained considering that they possess holocentric chromosomes that can favour the stabilization and inheritance of chromosomal rearrangements. Lastly, our experiments did not detect the presence of chimeric assemblies in the newly available A. glycines biotype 1 genome, differently from what reported in assembled genome of other aphid species, suggesting that chromosomal mapping can be used to ascertain the quality of assembled genomes.
