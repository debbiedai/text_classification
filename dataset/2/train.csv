negative,"A small genomic region containing several loci required for gastrulation in Drosophila. Genetic screens in Drosophila designed to search for loci involved in gastrulation have identified four regions of the genome that are required zygotically for the formation of the ventral furrow. For three of these, the genes responsible for the mutant phenotypes have been found. We now describe a genetic characterization of the fourth region, which encompasses the cytogenetic interval 24C3-25B, and the mapping of genes involved in gastrulation in this region. We have determined the precise breakpoints of several existing deficiencies and have generated new deficiencies. Our results show that the region contains at least three different loci associated with gastrulation effects. One maternal effect gene involved in ventral furrow formation maps at 24F but could not be identified. For a second maternal effect gene which is required for germ band extension, we identify a candidate gene, CG31660, which encodes a G protein coupled receptor. Finally, one gene acts zygotically in ventral furrow formation and we identify it as Traf4. "
positive,"Genome-wide identification of chitin-binding proteins and characterization of BmCBP1 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti BGSC 4C1, a typical strain with toxicity to Lepidoptera insects. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti was used to control caterpillars from 1970s. Here we reported the complete genome of BGSC 4C1, the type strain of this serovar. It has a circular chromosome and six plasmids. The largest plasmid pBMB267 contains five insecticidal crystal protein genes (two copies of cry1Ae, cry1Gb, cry2Ab, and a novel cry1M-type gene) and three vegetative insecticidal protein genes (a novel binary toxin gene operon vip1-vip2 and vip3Aa). Besides, the strain also has many genes encodeing virulence factors, and some secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters involved in synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and bacteriocins. In addition, there is a poly γ-glutamate synthesis gene cluster, whose product is a candidate to control inflammasome-mediated disorders and potential in many other fields. "
negative,"Expansion of LINEs and species-specific DNA repeats drives genome expansion in Asian Gypsy Moths. Two subspecies of Asian gypsy moth (AGM), Lymantria dispar asiatica and L. dispar japonica, pose a serious alien invasive threat to North American forests. Despite decades of research on the ecology and biology of this pest, limited AGM-specific genomic resources are currently available. Here, we report on the genome sequences and functional content of these AGM subspecies. The genomes of L.d. asiatica and L.d. japonica are the largest lepidopteran genomes sequenced to date, totaling 921 and 999 megabases, respectively. Large genome size in these subspecies is driven by the accumulation of specific classes of repeats. Genome-wide metabolic pathway reconstructions suggest strong genomic signatures of energy-related pathways in both subspecies, dominated by metabolic functions related to thermogenesis. The genome sequences reported here will provide tools for probing the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic traits that are thought to enhance AGM invasiveness. "
negative,"Caste development and reproduction: a genome-wide analysis of hallmarks of insect eusociality. The honey bee queen and worker castes are a model system for developmental plasticity. We used established expressed sequence tag information for a Gene Ontology based annotation of genes that are differentially expressed during caste development. Metabolic regulation emerged as a major theme, with a caste-specific difference in the expression of oxidoreductases vs. hydrolases. Motif searches in upstream regions revealed group-specific motifs, providing an entry point to cis-regulatory network studies on caste genes. For genes putatively involved in reproduction, meiosis-associated factors came out as highly conserved, whereas some determinants of embryonic axes either do not have clear orthologs (bag of marbles, gurken, torso), or appear to be lacking (trunk) in the bee genome. Our results are the outcome of a first genome-based initiative to provide an annotated framework for trends in gene regulation during female caste differentiation (representing developmental plasticity) and reproduction. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of a genomic clone for the gene of an insect molting enzyme, chitinase. Genomic clones for a chitinolytic enzyme were isolated from a library of Sau 3A digested DNA from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, using a previously isolated chitinase cDNA clone as a probe [Kramer et al., Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 23, 691-701 (1993)]. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot analysis of four genomic clones suggested that these are overlapping clones. Sequence analysis of the genomic clones and Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA also suggest that the M. sexta genome has only one chitinase gene detectable by the cDNA probe. This gene is organized into at least 11 exons in a region spanning > 11 kb. The sequenced M. sexta chitinase gene has a series of exons corresponding to identifiable structural / functional regions of the protein. Similarities in structure and organization between the M. sexta chitinase gene and chitinase genes from other sources are described. "
negative,"The genomics of insecticide resistance: insights from recent studies in African malaria vectors. Over 80% of the world's population is at risk from arthropod-vectored diseases, and arthropod crop pests are a significant threat to food security. Insecticides are our front-line response for controlling these disease vectors and pests, and consequently the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance is of global concern. Here we provide a brief overview of how genomics can be used to implement effective insecticide resistance management (IRM), with a focus on recent advances in the study of Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria in Africa. These advances unlock the potential for a predictive form of IRM, allowing tractable feedback for stakeholders, where the latest field data and well parameterised models can maximise the lifetime and effectiveness of available insecticides. "
negative,"Chromosomal deletions mediated by CRISPR / Cas9 in Helicoverpa armigera. Helicoverpa armigera, cotton bollworm, is one of the most disastrous pests worldwide, threatening various food and economic crops. Functional genomic tools may provide efficient approaches for its management. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, dependent on a single guide RNA (sgRNA), has been used to induce indels for targeted mutagenesis in cotton bollworm. However, genomic deletions may be more desirable to disrupt the function of noncoding genes or regulatory sequences. By injecting two sgRNAs with Cas9 protein targeting different exons, we obtained predictable genomic deletions of several hundred bases. We achieved this type of modification with different combinations of sgRNA pairs, including HaCad and HaABCC2. Our finding indicated that CRISPR / Cas9 can be used as an efficient tool to engineer genomes with chromosomal deletion in H. armigera. "
negative,"Disease vectors in the era of next generation sequencing. Almost 20 % of all infectious human diseases are vector borne and, together, are responsible for over one million deaths per annum. Over the past decade, the decreasing costs of massively parallel sequencing technologies have facilitated the agnostic interrogation of insect vector genomes, giving medical entomologists access to an ever-expanding volume of high-quality genomic and transcriptomic data. In this review, we highlight how genomics resources have provided new insights into the physiology, behavior, and evolution of human disease vectors within the context of the global health landscape. "
negative,"Rapid evolution in insect pests: the importance of space and time in population genomics studies. Pest species in agroecosystems often exhibit patterns of rapid evolution to environmental and human-imposed selection pressures. Although the role of adaptive processes is well accepted, few insect pests have been studied in detail and most research has focused on selection at insecticide resistance candidate genes. Emerging genomic datasets provide opportunities to detect and quantify selection in insect pest populations, and address long-standing questions about mechanisms underlying rapid evolutionary change. We examine the strengths of recent studies that stratify population samples both in space (along environmental gradients and comparing ancestral vs. derived populations) and in time (using chronological sampling, museum specimens and comparative phylogenomics), resulting in critical insights on evolutionary processes, and providing new directions for studying pests in agroecosystems. "
negative,"Genomic data reveal high conservation but divergent evolutionary pattern of Polycomb / Trithorax group genes in arthropods. Epigenetic gene control is maintained by chromatin-associated Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) genes, which act antagonistically via the interplay between PcG and TrxG regulation to generate silenced or permissive transcriptional states. In this study, we searched for PcG / TrxG genes in 180 arthropod genomes, covering all the sequenced arthropod genomes at the time of conducting this study, to perform a global investigation of PcG / TrxG genes in a phylogenetic frame. Results of ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed that the ancestor of arthropod species has an almost complete repertoire of PcG / TrxG genes, and most of these genes were seldom lost above order level. The domain diversity analysis indicated that the PcG / TrxG genes show variable extent of domain structure changes; some of these changes could be associated with lineage-specific events. The likelihood ratio tests for selection pressure detected a number of PcG / TrxG genes which underwent episodic positive selection on the branch leading to the insects with holometabolous development. These results suggest that, despite their high conservation across arthropod species, different members of PcG / TrxG genes showed considerable differences in domain structure and sequence divergence in arthropod evolution. Our cross species comparisons using large-scale genomic data provide insights into divergent evolutionary pattern on highly conserved genes in arthropods. "
negative,"Implication for DNA methylation involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). DNA methylation exerts extensive impacts on gene expression of various living organisms exposed to environmental variation. However, little is known whether DNA methylation is involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a worldwide destructive pest of crucifers. In this study, we found that P. xylostella genome exhibited a relatively low level of DNA methylation on the basis of the CpG O / E prediction and experimental validation. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between the stage-specific expressions of PxDNMT1 and DNA methylation levels (5mC content). Particularly, high levels of DNA methylation and gene expression of PxDNMT1 were observed in eggs and mature females of P. xylostella. After host transfer of P. xylostella from Raphanus sativus to Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified some potential genomic loci that might have changed methylation levels. Using the method of fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP), we also found the corresponding genes primarily involved in neural system and signaling. The expressions of six candidate genes were verified by qRT-PCR. One of the genes, Px009600, might be regulated by a DNA methylation-mediated mechanism in response to host transfer. Our study provides evidence for a functional system of DNA methylation in P. xylostella and its possible role in adaptation during host transfer. Further studies should examine methylation as responsive factors to different host plants and environmental cues in insect pests. "
positive,"Biochemical characterization of three midgut chitin deacetylases of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori. Peritrophic membrane (PM) is a chitin and protein-containing extracellular matrix that lines the midgut in most insect species, functioning as a barrier to exogenous toxins and pathogens. Midgut chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are chitin-modifying enzymes known to alter the mechanical property and permeability of PM. However, biochemical properties and specific roles of these enzymes remain elusive. In this study, the midgut-expressed CDAs (BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8) from Bombyx mori were cloned, recombinantly expressed and purified and their enzymatic activities toward PM chitin were determined. Of the three enzymes, BmCDA7 exhibited the highest activity (0.284 μmol / min / μmol), while BmCDA8 showed lower activity of 0.061 μmol / min / μmol. BmCDA6 was inactive towards PM chitin. Gene expression patterns indicated that although all three CDA genes were specifically expressed in the anterior midgut, they differed in their temporal expression patterns. BmCDA6 was expressed almost exclusively at the mid-molt stage, the stage when the PM was thick and with multiple chitin layers. Unlike BmCDA6, high expression levels of BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 were observed only at the feeding stage, the stage when the PM is thin and with fewer chitin layers. The different gene expression patterns and biochemical characteristics provide new information about the functional specialization among BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 proteins. "
positive,"The cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. Members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cysLGIC) superfamily mediate chemical neurotransmission and are studied extensively as potential targets of drugs used to treat neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Insect cys-loop LGICs also have central roles in the nervous system and are targets of highly successful insecticides. Here, we describe the cysLGIC superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is emerging as a highly useful model organism and is deployed as a biological control of insect pests. The wasp superfamily consists of 26 genes, which is the largest insect cysLGIC superfamily characterized, whereas Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum have 23, 21 and 24, respectively. As with Apis, Drosophila and Tribolium, Nasonia possesses ion channels predicted to be gated by acetylcholine, gamma-amino butyric acid, glutamate and histamine, as well as orthologues of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to other insects, wasp cysLGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing, which may also serve to generate species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on N. vitripennis enhance our understanding of cysLGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the study of their function in the wasp model, as well as for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of insect-symbiotic bacteria: influence of host environment on microbial genome composition. Commensal symbionts, thought to be intermediary amid obligate mutualists and facultative parasites, offer insight into forces driving the evolutionary transition into mutualism. Using macroarrays developed for a close relative, Escherichia coli, we utilized a heterologous array hybridization approach to infer the genomic compositions of a clade of bacteria that have recently established symbiotic associations: Sodalis glossinidius with the tsetse fly (Diptera, Glossina spp.) and Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE) with the rice weevil (Coleoptera, Sitophilus oryzae). Functional biologies within their hosts currently reflect different forms of symbiotic associations. Their hosts, members of distant insect taxa, occupy distinct ecological niches and have evolved to survive on restricted diets of blood for tsetse and cereal for the rice weevil. Comparison of genome contents between the two microbes indicates statistically significant differences in the retention of genes involved in carbon compound catabolism, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and transport. The greatest reductions have occurred in carbon catabolism, membrane proteins, and cell structure-related genes for Sodalis and in genes involved in cellular processes (i.e., adaptations towards cellular conditions) for SOPE. Modifications in metabolic pathways, in the form of functional losses complementing particularities in host physiology and ecology, may have occurred upon initial entry from a free-living to a symbiotic state. It is possible that these adaptations, streamlining genomes, act to make a free-living state no longer feasible for the harnessed microbe. "
negative,"Body lice and head lice (Anoplura: Pediculidae) have the smallest genomes of any hemimetabolous insect reported to date. The human body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus L. (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is a vector of several diseases, including louse-borne epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever, whereas the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is more a pest of social concern. Sequencing of the body louse genome has recently been proposed and undertaken by National Human Genome Research Institute. One of the first steps in understanding an organism's genome is to determine its genome size. Here, using flow cytometry determinations, we present evidence that body louse genome size is 104.7 + / - 1.4 Mb for females and 108.3 + / - 1.1 Mb for males. Our results suggest that head lice also have a small genome size, of similar size to the body louse. Thus, Pediculus lice have one of the smallest genome sizes known in insects, suggesting it may be a suitable choice as a minimal hemimetabolous genome. "
positive,"Expression of a novel member of the odorant-binding protein gene family in Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae). We previously showed that gene expression in the midgut of female Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was altered after ingestion of a bloodmeal and some of the expressed cDNAs showed stage-, sex-, and tissue-specific expression. One of these expressed cDNAs, CN G11B, is here shown to be similar to members of a gene family that encodes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 is a cDNA fragment of 721 bp, is incomplete at the 5'-end, and contains a canonical polyadenylic acid tail signal sequence in the 103-bp 3'-untranslated region. Translation of CN G11B.1 provides a putative protein product of 207 amino acids. GenBank tblastx, VectorBase, and Pfam database searches showed identity to hypothetical proteins from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (86%) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (55%). These proteins have structural motifs similar to those found in the gene family that includes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 putative protein has two of the six cysteines that are highly conserved in most invertebrate odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 expression increased in thoraces (6-12 h) and in abdomens (3-48 h) of blood fed female Cx. nigripalpus but was not detected in RNA from heads, indicating a possible role in both chemoreception and blood feeding. "
positive,"Molecular diversity of PBAN family peptides from fire ants. The PBAN / Pyrokinin peptide family is a major neuropeptide family characterized with a common FXPRLamide in the C-termini. These peptides are ubiquitously distributed in the Insecta and are involved in many essential endocrinal functions, e.g., pheromone production. Previous work demonstrated the localization of PBAN in the fire ant central nervous system, and identified a new family of PBAN from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. In this study, we identified five more PBAN / Pyrokinin genes from S. geminata, S. richteri, S. pergandii, S. carolinensis, and a hybrid of S. invicta and S. richteri. The gene sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these species and hybrid, which compared well to the morphologically defined fire ant subgroup complexes. The putative PBAN and other peptides were determined from the amino acid sequences of the PBAN / pyrokinin genes. We summarized all known insect PBAN family neuropeptides, and for the first time constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the full amino acid sequences translated from representative PBAN cDNAs. The PBAN / pyrokinin gene is well conserved in Insecta and probably extends into the Arthropod phylum; however, translated pre-propeptides may vary and functional diversity may be retained, lost, or modified during the evolutionary process. "
negative,"Transient expression of a promoter-reporter construct in differentiated adult salivary glands and embryos of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Vector-borne pathogens develop in close association with specific tissues in their insect hosts. Efforts are being made to characterize insect genes that are expressed in tissues that have important roles in pathogen propagation. Successful transfection and expression of exogenous genes in terminally differentiated tissues of insects has previously proven difficult. Here we report a method that should allow the analysis of genes that are expressed in adult tissues and organs. Transient expression assays have been developed using the salivary glands of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which can now be used to analyze salivary gland-specific promoter sequences. A liposome-based transfection reagent was used to transfect cultured adult salivary glands with a DNA construct carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock 70 promoter. Luciferase activity was detected in glands 18-20 hr post-transfection. This assay can now be used to determine the regulatory activity of other putative promoter sequences from salivary gland-specific genes. Alternatively, the assay may be used to study the effect of recombinant gene expression on parasite invasion and development. In addition, transient expression of gene constructs in embryos is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing genes that are expressed at this stage of the mosquito life cycle. "
positive,"Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in fruit fly Bactrocera minax. BACKGROUND: Vision plays a critical role in host location and oviposition behavior for herbivorous insects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying visual regulation in host recognition and oviposition site selection in insects remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the key visual genes that are linked to the host plant location of the fruit fly, Bactrocera minax. RESULTS: Using a host specialist fruit fly, B. minax, which lays eggs only into immature green citrus fruit, we undertook behavioral, transcriptomic, and RNAi research to identify the molecular basis for host fruit color recognition. In laboratory and field assays we found that adults prefer green over other colors, and this preference is significantly increased in sexually mature over immature flies. Furthermore, we identified that the Rh6 gene, responsible for green spectral sensitivity, has elevated expression in mature flies over immature flies. RNAi suppression of Rh6 eliminated the preference for green, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of eggs laid by B. minax in green unripe citrus. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in B. minax, providing a genetic basis for visual host location in a non-model insect herbivore. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Many roads to resistance: how invertebrates adapt to Bt toxins. The Cry family of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal and nematicidal proteins constitutes a valuable source of environmentally benign compounds for the control of insect pests and disease agents. An understanding of Cry toxin resistance at a molecular level will be critical to the long-term utility of this technology; it may also shed light on basic mechanisms used by other bacterial toxins that target specific organisms or cell types. Selection and cross-resistance studies have confirmed that genetic adaptation can elicit varying patterns of Cry toxin resistance, which has been associated with deficient protoxin activation by host proteases, and defective Cry toxin-binding cell surface molecules, such as cadherins, aminopeptidases and glycolipids. Recent work also suggests Cry toxin resistance may be induced in invertebrates as an active immune response. The use of model invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as advances in insect genomics, are likely to accelerate efforts to clone Cry toxin resistance genes and come to a detailed and broad understanding of Cry toxin resistance. "
negative,"Genome-wide microarray screening for Bombyx mori genes related to transmitting the determination outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs. The bivoltine silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) exhibits a maternally controlled embryonic diapause. Maternal silkworms decide whether to lay diapause or nondiapause eggs depending on environmental factors such as the temperature and photoperiod during the egg and larval stages, and then induce diapause eggs during the pupal stage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that conveys the outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs from the egg or larval stages to the pupal stage. This study used microarray analysis to investigate differentially expressed genes in the larval brains of diapause- and nondiapause-egg producers, to which bivoltine silkworms were destined by thermal or photic stimulation during the egg stage. The cytochrome P450 18a1 and Krüppel homolog 1 genes were upregulated in producers of diapause eggs compared with those of nondiapause eggs under both experimental conditions. Cytochrome P450 18a1 encodes a key enzyme for steroid hormone inactivation and Krüppel homolog 1 is an early juvenile hormone-inducible gene that mediates the repression of metamorphosis. The upregulation of these genes during the larval stage might be involved in the signaling pathway that transmits information about the diapause program from the egg stage to the pupal stage in the silkworm. "
positive,"Identification and functional characterisation of a novel N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid metabolising cytochrome P450, CYP9Q6, from the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Recent work has shown that two bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5, are important biochemical determinants of sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we report the characterisation of a third P450 gene CYP9Q6, previously mis-annotated in the genome of B. terrestris, encoding an enzyme that metabolises the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids thiacloprid and acetamiprid with high efficiency. The genomic location and complete ORF of CYP9Q6 was corroborated by PCR and its metabolic activity characterised in vitro by expression in an insect cell line. CYP9Q6 metabolises both thiacloprid and acetamiprid more rapidly than the previously reported CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5. We further demonstrate a direct, in vivo correlation between the expression of the CYP9Q6 enzyme in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and an increased tolerance to thiacloprid and acetamiprid. We conclude that CYP9Q6 is an efficient metaboliser of N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids and likely plays a key role in the high tolerance of B. terrestris to these insecticides. "
negative,"Butterfly genomics eclosing. Technological and conceptual advances of the last decade have led to an explosion of genomic data and the emergence of new research avenues. Evolutionary and ecological functional genomics, with its focus on the genes that affect ecological success and adaptation in natural populations, benefits immensely from a phylogenetically widespread sampling of biological patterns and processes. Among those organisms outside established model systems, butterflies offer exceptional opportunities for multidisciplinary research on the processes generating and maintaining variation in ecologically relevant traits. Here we highlight research on wing color pattern variation in two groups of Nymphalid butterflies, the African species Bicyclus anynana (subfamily Satyrinae) and species of the South American genus Heliconius (subfamily Heliconiinae), which are emerging as important systems for studying the nature and origins of functional diversity. Growing genomic resources including genomic and cDNA libraries, dense genetic maps, high-density gene arrays, and genetic transformation techniques are extending current gene mapping and expression profiling analysis and enabling the next generation of research questions linking genes, development, form, and fitness. Efforts to develop such resources in Bicyclus and Heliconius underscore the general challenges facing the larger research community and highlight the need for a community-wide effort to extend ongoing functional genomic research on butterflies. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome of Diaphania indica(saunders) (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) and implications for its phylogeny. The cucumber moth, Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepipdoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important insect pest of cucurbits and is widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Herein, we obtained entire mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of D. indica using polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing method. The complete mitogenome of D. indica is 15,367bp long, including 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and an A+T rich element. Both the AT skew and GC skew are slightly negative in the newly sequenced mitogenome. All of the 12 PCGs initiate with canonical start codon (ATN), except for coxI that initiate with CGA. The A+T rich element of D. indica is 467bp long and contains many features common to Pyraloidea insects. In addition, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the eight superfamiles of lepidopterans by employing Neighbor joining (NJ) and Maximum likelihood (ML) methods, and both yielded identical topologies. The phylogeny results supported the monophyly of lepidopteran superfamilies. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree showed that D. indica belongs to the Pyraloidea superfamily. "
negative,"A picorna-like virus from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta: initial discovery, genome sequence, and characterization. We report the first discovery and genome sequence of a virus infecting the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. The 8026 nucleotide, polyadenylated, RNA genome encoded two large open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), flanked and separated by 27, 223, and 171 nucleotide untranslated regions, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 5' proximal ORF1 (nucleotides 28 to 4218) exhibited significant identity and possessed consensus sequences characteristic of the helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence motifs from picornaviruses, picorna-like viruses, comoviruses, caliciviruses, and sequiviruses. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 3' proximal ORF2 (nucleotides 4390-7803) showed similarity to structural proteins in picorna-like viruses, especially the acute bee paralysis virus. Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained samples from virus-infected fire ants revealed isometric particles with a diameter of 31 nm, consistent with Picornaviridae. A survey for the fire ant virus from areas around Florida revealed a pattern of fairly widespread distribution. Among 168 nests surveyed, 22.9% were infected. The virus was found to infect all fire ant caste members and developmental stages, including eggs, early (1st-2nd) and late (3rd-4th) instars, worker pupae, workers, sexual pupae, alates ( male symbol and female symbol ), and queens. The virus, tentatively named S. invicta virus (SINV-1), appears to belong to the picorna-like viruses. We did not observe any perceptible symptoms among infected nests in the field. However, in every case where an SINV-1-infected colony was excavated from the field with an inseminated queen and held in the laboratory, all of the brood in these colonies died within 3 months. "
negative,"The GH / IGF-I axis and longevity. Several converging lines of evidence obtained over the last years in a wide variety of experimental model organisms suggest that the ageing process is regulated by genes that encode proteins from the somatotroph axis: longevity genes like daf-2, which were identified using mutant Caenorhabditis elegans strains, turned out to be orthologues of the mammalian genes encoding insulin-like signalling cascade proteins. Transgenic flies with mutations in the corresponding insect genes showed a similar pattern of increased lifespan. Finally, mice with spontaneous mutations leading to pituitary hormone deficiency significantly outlived controls. While these and other genetic models suggest that the downregulation of the somatotroph axis can slow the ageing process, other results from studies using pharmacological administration of growth hormone suggest that such stimulating treatment can restore some of the phenotypic traits associated with youth. To better understand the role of the insulin-like receptors in mammalian lifespan regulation and ageing, we explored the phenotype of heterozygous IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) knockout mice. Compared with control littermates these mutants live longer without any obvious impairment of their health and physiology, except a reduced glucose tolerance that we observed in males. These IGF1R(+ / -) mutants were also more resistant to oxidative stress in vivo, and we identified a possible molecular pathway linking underphosphorylation of IGF-I receptors to the lack of activation of p66Shc, a protein capable of increasing resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of a set of downstream genes. These and other results suggest that in mammals too, lifespan can be increased by continuous, long-term downregulation of IGF signalling. Since growth hormone administration normally stimulates IGF production in tissues, the question arises whether the beneficial effects of GH, as reported by others, could be IGF independent. This hypothesis can be addressed, for example, by adequately combining existing transgenic mouse models. "
positive,"Isolation of diapause-regulated genes from the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis by suppressive subtractive hybridization. Subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH) was used to characterize the diapause transcriptome of the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. Through these efforts, we isolated 97 unique clones which were used as probes in northern hybridization to assess their expression during diapause. Of these, 17 were confirmed to be diapause upregulated and 1 was diapause downregulated, while 12 were shown to be unaffected by diapause in this species. The diapause upregulated genes fall into several broad categories including heat shock proteins, heavy metal responsive genes, neuropeptides, structural genes, regulatory elements, and several genes of unknown function. In combination with other large-scale analyses of gene expression during diapause, this study assists in the characterization of the S. crassipalpis diapause transcriptome, and begins to identify common elements involved in diapause across diverse taxa.

negative,"Identification of two arginases generated by alternative splicing in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. Here, we have cloned two arginase cDNAs from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The analysis of exon / intron structures showed that the two mRNAs named bmarg-r and bmarg-f were generated from a single gene by alternative usage of exons. The bmarg-r and bmarg-f were predicted to encode almost the same amino acid sequences, except that the latter had additional ten N-terminal residues. Recombinant bmARG-r and bmARG-f in Escherichia coli cell lysates were roughly similar to each other in enzymatic characteristics, which did not show large difference from those of arginases assayed by using tissue extracts. Differential RT-PCR experiments and tissue distribution analyses of arginase activity indicated that the bmarg-r gene is expressed in the male reproductive organs, especially in the glandula lacteola and vesicular seminalis, from which it is secreted to the seminal fluid and transferred to the female during copulation, whereas the bmarg-f gene is expressed in the larval and adult nonreproductive organs including the fat body and muscle, where the produced arginase proteins are considered to stay in the cells. Thus, the two silkworm arginase isoforms may have a difference in whether or not the product is excreted out of the cells in which it is synthesized. "
negative,"Extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice (Phthiraptera: Insecta). The arrangement of genes in the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of most insects is the same, or near-identical, to that inferred to be ancestral for insects. We sequenced the entire mt genome of the small pigeon louse, Campanulotes bidentatus compar, and part of the mt genomes of nine other species of lice. These species were from six families and the three main suborders of the order Phthiraptera. There was no variation in gene arrangement among species within a family but there was much variation in gene arrangement among the three suborders of lice. There has been an extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice! "
negative,"Rice bean: a lesser known pulse with well-recognized potential. MAIN CONCLUSION: Required genetic resources for the improvement of agronomic, nutritional and economic value of rice bean are available in the world collection. International cooperative effort is required to utilize and conserve them. Rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi], a lesser known pulse among the Asiatic Vigna, has long been considered as a food security crop of small and marginal farmers of Southeast Asia. Considered as a nutritionally rich food and fodder, it is also a source of genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance including drought, soil acidity and storage pest. Although it spread from its centre of domestication in the Indo-China region to other parts around the world, it never became an important crop anywhere probably because of agronomic disadvantages. Crop improvement for determinate nature, good yield, less variable seed colour, pleasant organoleptic properties and lower antinutrients is required. Scanning of scientific literature indicates that genetic resources with desirable agronomic and nutritional traits exist within the current collection but are spread across countries. Genomic studies in the species indicate that except for insect resistance and aluminium toxicity tolerance, not much attention has been paid to decipher and utilize other stress tolerance and nutritional quality traits. Collaborative efforts towards improving farming, food, trade value and off-farm conservation of rice bean would not only help marginal farmers but will also help to preserve the yet to be explored genomic resources available in this sturdy pulse.

negative,"Sequencing of Culex quinquefasciatus establishes a platform for mosquito comparative genomics. Culex quinquefasciatus (the southern house mosquito) is an important mosquito vector of viruses such as West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as well as of nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. C. quinquefasciatus is one species within the Culex pipiens species complex and can be found throughout tropical and temperate climates of the world. The ability of C. quinquefasciatus to take blood meals from birds, livestock, and humans contributes to its ability to vector pathogens between species. Here, we describe the genomic sequence of C. quinquefasciatus: Its repertoire of 18,883 protein-coding genes is 22% larger than that of Aedes aegypti and 52% larger than that of Anopheles gambiae with multiple gene-family expansions, including olfactory and gustatory receptors, salivary gland genes, and genes associated with xenobiotic detoxification. "
negative,"Pheromone production in bark beetles. The first aggregation pheromone components from bark beetles were identified in 1966 as a mixture of ipsdienol, ipsenol and verbenol. Since then, a number of additional components have been identified as both aggregation and anti-aggregation pheromones, with many of them being monoterpenoids or derived from monoterpenoids. The structural similarity between the major pheromone components of bark beetles and the monoterpenes found in the host trees, along with the association of monoterpenoid production with plant tissue, led to the paradigm that most if not all bark beetle pheromone components were derived from host tree precursors, often with a simple hydroxylation producing the pheromone. In the 1990 s there was a paradigm shift as evidence for de novo biosynthesis of pheromone components began to accumulate, and it is now recognized that most bark beetle monoterpenoid aggregation pheromone components are biosynthesized de novo. The bark beetle aggregation pheromones are released from the frass, which is consistent with the isoprenoid aggregation pheromones, including ipsdienol, ipsenol and frontalin, being produced in midgut tissue. It appears that exo-brevocomin is produced de novo in fat body tissue, and that verbenol, verbenone and verbenene are produced from dietary α-pinene in fat body tissue. Combined biochemical, molecular and functional genomics studies in Ips pini yielded the discovery and characterization of the enzymes that convert mevalonate pathway intermediates to pheromone components, including a novel bifunctional geranyl diphosphate synthase / myrcene synthase, a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates myrcene to ipsdienol, and an oxidoreductase that interconverts ipsdienol and ipsdienone to achieve the appropriate stereochemistry of ipsdienol for pheromonal activity. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes and their corresponding enzymes proved complex and diverse in different species. Mevalonate pathway genes in pheromone producing male I. pini have much higher basal levels than in females, and feeding induces their expression. In I. duplicatus and I. pini, juvenile hormone III (JH III) induces pheromone production in the absence of feeding, whereas in I. paraconfusus and I. confusus, topically applied JH III does not induce pheromone production. In all four species, feeding induces pheromone production. While many of the details of pheromone production, including the site of synthesis, pathways and knowledge of the enzymes involved are known for Ips, less is known about pheromone production in Dendroctonus. Functional genomics studies are under way in D. ponderosae, which should rapidly increase our understanding of pheromone production in this genus. This chapter presents a historical development of what is known about pheromone production in bark beetles, emphasizes the genomic and post-genomic work in I. pini and points out areas where research is needed to obtain a more complete understanding of pheromone production. "
negative,"Bacillus thuringiensis toxin resistance mechanisms among Lepidoptera: progress on genomic approaches to uncover causal mutations in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. Transgenic plants that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (Cry) protein toxins (Bt crops) effectively control feeding by the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, although documented resistance evolution among a number of species in both the laboratory and field has heightened concerns about the durability of this technology. Research has provided major insights into the mutations that alter Bt toxin binding receptor structure and function within the midgut of Lepidoptera that directly impacts the efficacy of Bt toxins, and potentially leads to the evolution of resistance to Bt crops in the field. In this manuscript we provide an overview of available data on the identification of genes involved in high levels of resistance to Cry toxins, with emphasis on resistance described for O. nubilalis as the main target of Bt corn. "
negative,"Ascovirus P64 Homologs: A Novel Family of Large Cationic Proteins That Condense Viral Genomic DNA for Encapsidation. Eukaryotic dsDNA viruses use small basic protamine-like proteins or histones, typically <15 kDa, to condense and encapsidate their genomic (g)DNAs during virogenesis. Ascoviruses are large dsDNA (~100⁻200 kbp) viruses that are pathogenic to lepidopteran larvae. Little is known about the molecular basis for condensation and encapsidation of their gDNAs. Previous proteomic analysis showed that Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus (SfAV-1a) virions contain a large unique DNA-binding protein (P64; 64 kDa, pI = 12.2) with a novel architecture proposed to condense its gDNA. Here we used physical, biochemical, and transmission electron microscopy techniques to demonstrate that P64's basic C-terminal domain condenses SfAV-1a gDNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that only P64 homologs in other ascovirus virions are unique in stably binding DNA. As similar protein families or subfamilies were not identified in extensive database searches, our collective data suggest that ascovirus P64 homologs comprise a novel family of atypical large viral gDNA condensing proteins.

negative,"Maize plants prime anti-herbivore responses by the memorizing and recalling of airborne information in their genome. Intact maize plants prime for defensive action against herbivory in response to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HI PVs) emitted from caterpillar-infested conspecific plants. The recent research showed that the primed defense in receiver plants that had been exposed to HI PVs was maintained for at least 5 d after exposure. Herbivory triggered the receiver plants to enhance the expression of a defense gene for trypsin inhibitor (TI ). At the upstream sequence of a TI gene, non-methylated cytosine residues were observed in the genome of HI PV-exposed plants more frequently than in that of healthy plant volatile-exposed plants. These findings provide an innovative mechanism for the memory of HI PV-mediated habituation for plant defense. This mechanism and further innovations for priming of defenses via plant communications will contribute to the development of plant volatile-based pest management methods in agriculture and horticulture. "
negative,"Plant-mediated RNAi silences midgut-expressed genes in congeneric lepidopteran insects in nature. BACKGROUND: Plant-mediated RNAi (PMRi) silencing of insect genes has enormous potential for crop protection, but whether it works robustly under field conditions, particularly with lepidopteran pests, remains controversial. Wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and cultivated tobacco (N. tabacum) (Solanaceae) is attacked by two closely related specialist herbivores Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae). When M. sexta larvae attack transgenic N. attenuata plants expressing double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) targeting M. sexta's midgut-expressed genes, the nicotine-ingestion induced cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (invert repeat (ir)CYP6B46-plants) and the lyciumoside-IV-ingestion induced β-glucosidase1 (irBG1-plants), these larval genes which are important for the larvae's response to ingested host toxins, are strongly silenced. RESULTS: Here we show that the PMRi procedure also silences the homologous genes in native M. quinquemaculata larvae feeding on irCYP6B46 and irBG1-transgenic N. attenuata plants in nature. The PMRi lines shared 98 and 96% sequence similarity with M. quinquemaculata homologous coding sequences, and CYP6B46 and BG1 transcripts were reduced by ca. 90 and 80%, without reducing the transcripts of the larvae's most similar, potential off-target genes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the PMRi procedure can robustly and specifically silence genes in native congeneric insects that share sufficient sequence similarity and with the careful selection of targets, might protect crops from attack by congeneric-groups of insect pests. "
positive,"Two functionally distinct CYP4G genes of Anopheles gambiae contribute to cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) biosynthesis is a major pathway of insect physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster the cytochrome P450 CYP4G1 catalyses the insect-specific oxidative decarbonylation step, while in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, two CYP4G paralogues, CYP4G16 and CYP4G17 are present. Analysis of the subcellular localization of CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 in larval and pupal stages revealed that CYP4G16 preserves its PM localization across developmental stages analyzed; however CYPG17 is differentially localized in two distinct types of pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes of larval and adult developmental specificity. Western blot analysis showed the presence of two CYP4G17 forms, potentially associated with each oenocyte type. Both An. gambiae CYP4Gs were expressed in D. melanogaster flies in a Cyp4g1 silenced background in order to functionally characterize them in vivo. CYP4G16, CYP4G17 or their combination rescued the lethal phenotype of Cyp4g1-knock down flies, demonstrating that CYP4G17 is also a functional decarbonylase, albeit of somewhat lower efficiency than CYP4G16 in Drosophila. Flies expressing mosquito CYP4G16 and / or CYP4G17 produced similar CHC profiles to 'wild-type' flies expressing the endogenous CYP4G1, but they also produce very long-chain dimethyl-branched CHCs not detectable in wild type flies, suggesting that the specificity of the CYP4G enzymes contributes to determine the complexity of the CHC blend. In conclusion, both An. gambiae CYP4G enzymes contribute to the unique Anopheles CHC profile, which has been associated to defense, adult desiccation tolerance, insecticide penetration rate and chemical communication. "
negative,"Evidence of two mechanisms involved in Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis decreased toxicity against mosquito larvae: Genome dynamic and toxins stability. Biopesticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis are the most used and most successful around the world. This bacterium is characterized by a dynamic genome able to win or lose genetic materials which leads to a decrease in its effectiveness. The detection of such phenomena is of great importance to monitor the stability of B. thuringiensis strains in industrial production processes of biopesticides. New local B. thuringiensis israelensis isolates were investigated. They present variable levels of delta-endotoxins production and insecticidal activities against Aedes aegypti larvae. Searching on the origin of this variability, molecular and biochemical analyses were performed. The obtained results describe two main reasons of the decrease of B. thuringiensis israelensis insecticidal activity. The first reason was the deletion of cry4Aa and cry10Aa genes from the 128-kb pBtoxis plasmid as evidenced in three strains (BLB124, BLB199 and BLB506) among five. The second was the early degradation of Cry toxins by proteases in larvae midgut mainly due to some amino acids substitutions evidenced in Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa δ-endotoxins detected in BLB356. Before biological treatment based on B. thuringiensis israelensis, the studies of microflore in each ecosystem have a great importance to succeed pest management programs.  "
negative,"Genome-based identification of spliceosomal proteins in the silk moth Bombyx mori. Pre-messenger RNA splicing is a highly conserved eukaryotic cellular function that takes place by way of a large, RNA-protein assembly known as the spliceosome. In the mammalian system, nearly 300 proteins associate with uridine-rich small nuclear (sn)RNAs to form this complex. Some of these splicing factors are ubiquitously present in the spliceosome, whereas others are involved only in the processing of specific transcripts. Several proteomics analyses have delineated the proteins of the spliceosome in several species. In this study, we mine multiple sequence data sets of the silk moth Bombyx mori in an attempt to identify the entire set of known spliceosomal proteins. Five data sets were utilized, including the 3X, 6X, and Build 2.0 genomic contigs as well as the expressed sequence tag and protein libraries. While homologs for 88% of vertebrate splicing factors were delineated in the Bombyx mori genome, there appear to be several spliceosomal polypeptides absent in Bombyx mori and seven additional insect species. This apparent increase in spliceosomal complexity in vertebrates may reflect the tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing requirements in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 eukaryotic taxa using the core splicing factors suggest that the essential functional units of the pre-mRNA processing machinery have remained highly conserved from yeast to humans. The Sm and LSm proteins are the most conserved, whereas proteins of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle are the most divergent. These data highlight both the differential conservation and relative phylogenetic signals of the essential spliceosomal components throughout evolution. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Sasakia funebris (Leech) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and comparison with other Apaturinae insects. Sasakia funebris, a member of the lepidopteran family, Nymphalidae (superfamily Papilionoidea) is a rare species and is found only in some areas of South China. In this study, the 15,233 bp long complete mitochondrial genome of S. funebris was determined, and harbors the gene arrangement identical to all other sequenced lepidopteran insects. The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A+T biased, accounting for 81.2%. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) start with typical ATN codons, except for COI which begins with the CGA codon. All tRNAs have a typical clover-leaf secondary structure, except for tRNASer(AGN), the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of which forms a simple loop. The S. funebris A+T-rich region of 370 bp contains several features common to the Lepidoptera insects, including the motif ATAGA followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, and two tandem repeats consisting of 18 bp repeat units and 14 bp repeat units. The phylogenetic analyses of Apaturinae based on mitogenome sequences showed: (S. funebris+Sasakia charonda)+(Apatura metis+Apatura ilia). This result is consistent with the morphological classification. "
negative,"Genome interdependence in insect-bacterium symbioses. Symbioses between unicellular and multicellular organisms have contributed significantly to the evolution of life on Earth. As exemplified by several studies of bacterium-insect symbioses, modern genomic techniques are providing exciting new information about the molecular basis and the biological roles of these complex relationships, revealing for instance that symbionts have lost many genes for functions that are provided by the host, but that they can provide amino acids that the host cannot synthesize. "
positive,"Characterization of a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene from Spodoptera exigua and its function identification through RNA interference. Trehalose is an important disaccharide and a key regulation factor for the development of many organisms, including plants, bacteria, fungi and insects. In order to study the trehalose synthesis pathway, a cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Spodoptera exigua (SeTPS) was cloned which contained an open reading frame of 2481 nucleotides encoding a protein of 826 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 92.65kDa. The SeTPS genome has 12 exons and 11 introns. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body and in the ovary. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in day 1 S. exigua pupae. The concentrations of trehalose and glucose in the hemolymph were determined by HPLC and showed that they varied at different developmental stages and were negatively correlated to each other. The survival rates of the insects injected with dsRNA corresponding to SeTPS gene reached 53.95%, 49.06%, 34.86% and 33.24% for 36, 48, 60 and 204h post-injection respectively which were significantly lower than those of the insects in three control groups. These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and potential function of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene. "
negative,"Post-integration behavior of a Minos transposon in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Transposable elements represent important tools to perform functional studies in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, the remobilization properties of transposable elements have been utilized for enhancer-trapping and insertional mutagenesis experiments, which have considerably helped in the functional characterization of the fruitfly genome. In Anopheles mosquitoes, the sole vectors of human malaria, as well as in other mosquito vectors of disease, the use of transposons has also been advocated to achieve the spread of anti-parasitic genes throughout field populations. Here we report on the post-integration behavior of the Minos transposon in both the germ-line and somatic tissues of Anopheles mosquitoes. Transgenic An. stephensi lines developed using the piggyBac transposon and expressing the Minos transposase were tested for their ability to remobilize an X-linked Minos element. Germ-line remobilization events were not detected, while somatic excisions and transpositions were consistently recovered. The analysis of these events showed that Minos activity in Anopheles cells is characterized by unconventional functionality of the transposon. In the two cases analyzed, re-integration of the transposon occurred onto the same X chromosome, suggesting a tendency for local hopping of Minos in the mosquito genome. This is the first report of the post-integration behavior of a transposable element in a human malaria vector. "
negative,"Enhanced whitefly resistance in transgenic tobacco plants expressing double stranded RNA of v-ATPase A gene. BACKGROUND: Expression of double strand RNA (dsRNA) designed against important insect genes in transgenic plants have been shown to give protection against pests through RNA interference (RNAi), thus opening the way for a new generation of insect-resistant crops. We have earlier compared the efficacy of dsRNAs / siRNAs, against a number of target genes, for interference in growth of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) upon oral feeding. The v-ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) coding gene was identified as a crucial target. We now report the effectiveness of transgenic tobacco plants expressing siRNA to silence v-ATPaseA gene expression for the control of whitefly infestation. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Transgenic tobacco lines were developed for the expression of long dsRNA precursor to make siRNA and knock down the v-ATPaseA mRNA in whitefly. Molecular analysis and insecticidal properties of the transgenic plants established the formation of siRNA targeting the whitefly v-ATPaseA, in the leaves. The transcript level of v-ATPaseA in whiteflies was reduced up to 62% after feeding on the transgenic plants. Heavy infestation of whiteflies on the control plants caused significant loss of sugar content which led to the drooping of leaves. The transgenic plants did not show drooping effect. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Host plant derived pest resistance was achieved against whiteflies by genetic transformation of tobacco which generated siRNA against the whitefly v-ATPaseA gene. Transgenic tobacco lines expressing dsRNA of v-ATPaseA, delivered sufficient siRNA to whiteflies feeding on them, mounting a significant silencing response, leading to their mortality. The transcript level of the target gene was reduced in whiteflies feeding on transgenic plants. The strategy can be taken up for genetic engineering of plants to control whiteflies in field crops. "
negative,"Experimental RNomics and genomic comparative analysis reveal a large group of species-specific small non-message RNAs in the silkworm Bombyx mori. Accumulating evidences show that small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. The silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of lepidopterous pests. Here, we have performed the first systematic identification and analysis of intermediate size ncRNAs (50-500 nt) in the silkworm. We identified 189 novel ncRNAs, including 141 snoRNAs, six snRNAs, three tRNAs, one SRP and 38 unclassified ncRNAs. Forty ncRNAs showed significantly altered expression during silkworm development or across specific stage transitions. Genomic comparisons revealed that 123 of these ncRNAs are potentially silkworm-specific. Analysis of the genomic organization of the ncRNA loci showed that 32.62% of the novel snoRNA loci are intergenic, and that all the intronic snoRNAs follow the pattern of one-snoRNA-per-intron. Target site analysis predicted a total of 95 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modification sites of rRNAs, snRNAs and tRNAs. Together, these findings provide new clues for future functional study of ncRNA during insect development and evolution. "
negative,"Host-mediated RNA interference targeting a cuticular protein gene impaired fecundity in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests. This study demonstrated the potential of MyCP dsRNA in developing RNAi-based resistance to M. persicae. RNAi-mediated resistance is expected to be more durable compared with other transgenic strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Evolution in the fast lane: rapidly evolving sex-related genes in Drosophila. A large portion of the annotated genes in Drosophila melanogaster show sex-biased expression, indicating that sex and reproduction-related genes (SRR genes) represent an appreciable component of the genome. Previous studies, in which subsets of genes were compared among few Drosophila species, have found that SRR genes exhibit unusual evolutionary patterns. Here, we have used the newly released genome sequences from 12 Drosophila species, coupled to a larger set of SRR genes, to comprehensively test the generality of these patterns. Among 2505 SRR genes examined, including ESTs with biased expression in reproductive tissues and genes characterized as involved in gametogenesis, we find that a relatively high proportion of SRR genes have experienced accelerated divergence throughout the genus Drosophila. Several testis-specific genes, male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs), and spermatogenesis genes show lineage-specific bursts of accelerated evolution and positive selection. SFP genes also show evidence of lineage-specific gene loss and / or gain. These results bring us closer to understanding the details of the evolutionary dynamics of SRR genes with respect to species divergence. "
negative,"A whole genome screening and RNA interference identify a juvenile hormone esterase-like gene of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in preventing precocious metamorphosis and stimulating reproduction. Thus, its hemolymph titer should be under a tight control. As a negative controller, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) performs a rapid breakdown of residual JH in the hemolymph during last instar to induce a larval-to-pupal metamorphosis. A whole genome of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, has been annotated and proposed 11 JHE candidates. Sequence analysis using conserved motifs commonly found in other JHEs proposed a putative JHE (Px004817). Px004817 (64.61 kDa, pI=5.28) exhibited a characteristic JHE expression pattern by showing high peak at the early last instar, at which JHE enzyme activity was also at a maximal level. RNA interference of Px004817 reduced JHE activity and interrupted pupal development with a significant increase of larval period. This study identifies Px004817 as a JHE-like gene of P. xylostella. "
negative,"The genome biology of phytoplasma: modulators of plants and insects. Phytoplasmas are bacterial pathogens of plants that are transmitted by insects. These bacteria uniquely multiply intracellularly in both plants (Plantae) and insects (Animalia). Similarly to bacterial endosymbionts, phytoplasmas have reduced genomes with limited metabolic capabilities. Nonetheless, the chromosomes of many phytoplasmas are rich in repeated DNA consisting of mobile elements. Phytoplasmas produce an arsenal of effectors most of which are encoded on these mobile elements and on plasmids. These effectors target conserved plant transcription factors resulting in witches' broom and leafy flower symptoms and suppression of plant defense to insect vectors that transmit the phytoplasmas. Future studies of these fascinating microbes will generate a wealth of new knowledge about forces that shape genomes and microbial interactions with multicellular hosts. "
negative,"The distribution of microsatellites in the Nasonia parasitoid wasp genome. Microsatellites are important molecular markers used in numerous genetic contexts. Despite this widespread use, the evolutionary processes governing microsatellite distribution and diversity remain controversial. Here, we present results on the distribution of microsatellites of three species in the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia generated by an in silico data-mining approach. Our results show that the overall microsatellite density in Nasonia is comparable to that of the honey bee, but much higher than in eight non-Hymenopteran arthropods. Across the Nasonia vitripennis genome, microsatellite density varied both within and amongst chromosomes. In contrast to other taxa, dinucleotides are the most abundant repeat type in all four species of Hymenoptera studied. Whether the differences between the Hymenoptera and other taxa are of functional significance remains to be determined. "
negative,"Transcriptome analysis in the beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis Fabricius, is a destructive pest on vegetable crops in tropics and subtropics; its main host plant is amaranth. It has become imperative to develop non-chemical methods to control S. recurvalis on amaranth. However, the lack of molecular information about this species has hindered the development of novel pest management strategies. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing covering de novo sequence assemblies, functional annotation of transcripts, gene function classification and enrichment was performed on S. recurvalis. Illumina sequencing generated a total of 120 435 transcript contigs ranging from 201 to 22 729 bases with a mean length of 688 bases. The assembled transcripts were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool-X (BLASTX) to obtain the annotations against non-redundant, Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) protein databases. A subset of 58 225 transcript sequences returned hits from known proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and the majority of the transcript sequences had the highest number of hits for Danaus plexippus (50.43%). A total of 1217 Gene Ontology-level 3 annotations were assigned to 51 805 transcripts, while 39 650 transcripts were predicted as functional protein-coding genes in the COG database and 20 037 transcripts were enriched to KEGG pathways. We identified 40 putative genes related to pheromone production and reception in S. recurvalis, with the expression of one gene between 0.29 and 1141.79 fragments per kilo base per million (FPKM) reads. The transcriptome sequence of S. recurvalis is a first step toward offering a comprehensive genomic resource which would enable better understanding of molecular mechanisms to enable development of effective pest management practices for this species.

negative,"Superinfection of five Wolbachia in the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) (Coleoptera: Curuculionidae). Wolbachia bacteria are among the most common endosymbionts in insects. In Wolbachia research, the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene has been used as a phylogenetic tool, but relationships inferred by single-locus analysis can be unreliable because of the extensive genome recombination among Wolbachia strains. Therefore, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method for Wolbachia, which relies upon a set of five conserved genes, is recommended. In this study, we examined whether the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford), is infected with Wolbachia using wsp and MLST genes. Wolbachia was detected from all tested specimens of X. germanus (n=120) by wsp amplification. Five distinct sequences (i.e. five alleles) for wsp were found, and labeled as wXge1-5. MLST analysis and molecular phylogeny of concatenated sequences of MLST genes identified wXge3 and wXge5 as closely-related strains. The detection rate of wXge4 and wXge1 was 100% and 63.3%, respectively; wXge2, wXge3 and wXge5 were detected from less than 15% of specimens. We performed mitochondrial haplotype analyses that identified three genetic types of X. germanus, i.e. Clades A, B and C. Wsp alleles wXge1, wXge2 and wXge4 were detected in all clade A beetles; wXge2 allele was absent from Clades B and C. We concluded that (i) five wsp alleles were found from X. germanus, (ii) use of MLST genes, rather than the wsp gene, are more suited to construct Wolbachia phylogenies and (iii) wsp alleles wXge2 and wXge3 / wXge5 would infect clade A and clade B / C of X. germanus, respectively.

negative,"Complete Genome Sequence of Bacillus bombysepticus, a Pathogen Leading to Bombyx mori Black Chest Septicemia. Bacillus bombysepticus is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium. Here, we announce the first complete genome sequence of this organism isolated from the cadavers of silkworm larvae that had been sick. The genome contains a single circular chromosome and a circular plasmid. Analyses of the B. bombysepticus genome will provide insights into its pathomechanisms and biology.  "
negative,"The complete mitogenome of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and comparison with other lepidopteran insects. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) was determined to be 15,653bp, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a A+T-rich region. It has the typical gene organization and order of mitogenomes from lepidopteran insects. The AT skew of this mitogenome was slightly positive and the nucleotide composition was also biased toward A+T nucleotides (81.31%). All PCGs were initiated by ATN codons, except for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene which was initiated by CGA. The cox1 and cox2 genes had incomplete stop codons consisting of just a T. All the tRNA genes displayed a typical clover-leaf structure of mitochondrial tRNA. The A+T-rich region of the mitogenome was 495bp in length and consisted of several features common to the lepidopteras. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the B. mori Dazao was close to Bombycidae. "
positive,"Downregulation of dystrophin expression in pupae of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci inhibits the emergence of adults. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a major pest to agriculture. Adults are able to fly for long distances and to colonize staple crops, herbs and ornamentals, and to vector viruses belonging to several important taxonomic groups. During their early development, whiteflies mature from eggs through several nymphal stages (instars I to IV) until adults emerge from pupae. We aim at reducing whitefly populations by inhibiting the emergence of adults from nymphs. Here we targeted dystrophin, a conserved protein essential for the development of the muscle system in humans, other animals and insects. We have exploited the fact that whitefly nymphs developing on tomato leaves feed from the plant phloem via their stylets. Thus, we delivered dystrophin-silencing double-stranded RNA to nymphs developing on leaves of tomato plantlets with their roots bathing in the silencing solution. Downregulation of dystrophin expression occurred mainly in pupae. Dystrophin silencing induced also the downregulation of the dystrophin-associated protein genes actin and tropomyosin, and disrupted F-actin. Most significantly, the treatment inhibited the emergence of adults from pupae, suggesting that targeting dystrophin may help to restrain whitefly populations. This study demonstrates for the first time the important role of dystrophin in the development of a major insect pest to agriculture. "
negative,"Ecdysteroid-mediated expression of hexamerin (arylphorin) in the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The insect development is intricately controlled by morphogenetic hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) through the regulation of gene / protein expression. The role of hexamerins in the metamorphosis of insects and reproduction and their control by 20E at the gene level has been widely reported in insects. In the present study we for the first time report the role of ecdysteroids in the regulation of hexamerin synthesis in a lepidopteran insect Corcyra cephalonica. The hormonal studies were carried out using the normal and the thorax-ligated insects with both 20E and its non-steroidal agonist RH-5992. The in vitro as well as in vivo studies showed a stimulatory effect of 20E and its agonist on the hexamerin synthesis including arylphorin (Hex 2), whereas hormone blockade with azadirachtin caused a time dependent reduction in synthesis. The northern analysis using Hex 2b cDNA as probe too confirmed the above result. This was followed by the cloning of the Hex 2b gene. The full length of the genomic clone was found to be 3.5kb long and has four exons interspersed by three introns. The genome walking analysis revealed the presence of a steroid hormone binding sequence ""Ecdysone response element"" (EcRE) in the 5' untranscribed region (UTR) of the gene. The data presented in this paper clearly suggest that hexamerin synthesis in C. cephalonica is transcriptionally regulated by 20E. "
negative,"Morphological and genomic characterization of the polydnavirus associated with the parasitoid wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Glyptapanteles indiensis polydnavirus (GiPDV) is essential for successful parasitization of the larval stage of the lepidopteran Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) by the endoparasitic wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis. This virus has not been characterized previously. Ultrastructural studies of GiPDV showed that virions had a rod-like or rectangular form and each contained as many as ten nucleocapsids enclosed by a single unit membrane envelope. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) analysis of the virus genomic DNA revealed that GiPDV had a segmented genome composed of 13 dsDNA segments, ranging in size from approximately 11 kb to more than 30 kb. Four genomic segments were present in higher molar concentration than the others. Further characterization of the GiPDV genome yielded several cDNA clones which derived from GiPDV-specific mRNAs, and Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of isolated cDNA clones in the parasitized host. Each was present on more than one GiPDV genomic DNA segment, suggesting the existence of related sequences among DNA segments. It has been proposed previously that in polydnavirus systems, genome segmentation, hypermolar ratio segments and segment nesting may function to increase the copy number of essential genes and to increase the levels of gene expression in the absence of virus replication. The present data support this notion and suggest that GiPDV morphology and genomic organization may be intrinsically linked to the function and evolutionary strategies of the virus. "
negative,"Insect symbionts as valuable grist for the biotechnological mill: an alkaliphilic silkworm gut bacterium for efficient lactic acid production. Insects constitute the most abundant and diverse animal class and act as hosts to an extraordinary variety of symbiotic microorganisms. These microbes living inside the insects play critical roles in host biology and are also valuable bioresources. Enterococcus mundtii EMB156, isolated from the larval gut (gut pH >10) of the model organism Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), efficiently produces lactic acid, an important metabolite for industrial production of bioplastic materials. E. mundtii EMB156 grows well under alkaline conditions and stably converts various carbon sources into lactic acid, offering advantages in downstream fermentative processes. High-yield lactic acid production can be achieved by the strain EMB156 from renewable biomass substrates under alkaline pretreatments. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology revealed its 3.01 Mbp whole genome sequence. A total of 2956 protein-coding sequences, 65 tRNA genes, and 6 rRNA operons were predicted in the EMB156 chromosome. Remarkable genomic features responsible for lactic acid fermentation included key enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate (PP) / glycolytic pathway, and an alpha amylase and xylose isomerase were characterized in EMB156. This genomic information coincides with the phenotype of E. mundtii EMB156, reflecting its metabolic flexibility in efficient lactate fermentation, and established a foundation for future biotechnological application. Interestingly, enzyme activities of amylase were quite stable in high-pH broths, indicating a possible mechanism for strong EMB156 growth in an alkaline environment, thereby facilitating lactic acid production. Together, these findings implied that valuable lactic acid-producing bacteria can be discovered efficiently by screening under the extremely alkaline conditions, as exemplified by gut microbial symbionts of Lepidoptera insects. "
negative,"Midgut and salivary gland transcriptomes of the arbovirus vector Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Numerous Culicoides spp. are important vectors of livestock or human disease pathogens. Transcriptome information from midguts and salivary glands of adult female Culicoides sonorensis provides new insight into vector biology. Of 1719 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from adult serum-fed female midguts harvested within 5 h of feeding, twenty-eight clusters of serine proteases were derived. Four clusters encode putative iron binding proteins (FER1, FERL, PXDL1, PXDL2), and two clusters encode metalloendopeptidases (MDP6C, MDP6D) that probably function in bloodmeal catabolism. In addition, a diverse variety of housekeeping cDNAs were identified. Selected midgut protease transcripts were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR): TRY1_115 and MDP6C mRNAs were induced in adult female midguts upon feeding, whereas TRY1_156 and CHYM1 were abundant in midguts both before and immediately after feeding. Of 708 salivary gland ESTs analysed, clusters representing two new classes of protein families were identified: a new class of D7 proteins and a new class of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. Additional cDNAs representing putative immunomodulatory proteins were also identified: 5' nucleotidases, antigen 5-related proteins, a hyaluronidase, a platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, mucins and several immune response cDNAs. Analysis by q-PCR showed that all D7 and Kunitz domain transcripts tested were highly enriched in female heads compared with other tissues and were generally absent from males. The mRNAs of two additional protease inhibitors, TFPI1 and TFPI2, were detected in salivary glands of paraffin-embedded females by in situ hybridization. "
negative,"Behavioral and genomic characterization of molt-sleep in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. During the transition from feeding to molting, larval insects undergo profound changes in behavior and patterns of gene expression regulated by the neuroendocrine system. For some species, a distinctive characteristic of molting larvae is presence of a quiescent state sometimes referred to as ""molt-sleep"". Here, observations of 4th instar Manduca sexta larvae indicate the molting period involves a predominantly quiescent state that shares behavioral properties of adult insect sleep in that it is rapidly reversible and accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to both mildly arousing and noxious stimuli. When subjected to noxious stimuli, molting larvae exhibit locomotory and avoidance behaviors similar to those of inter-molt larvae. Although less consolidated, inter-molt quiescence shares many of the same behavioral traits with molting quiescence. However, when subjected to deprivation of quiescence, inter-molt larvae display a compensatory rebound behavior that is not detected in molting larvae. This suggests that molting quiescence is a specialized form of inactivity that affords survival advantages to molting larvae. RNA-seq analysis of molting larvae shows general reduction in expression of genes encoding GPCRs and down regulation of genes connected with cyclic nucleotide signaling. On the other hand, certain ion channel genes are up-regulated, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, chloride channels and a voltage-dependent calcium channel. These findings suggest patterns of gene expression consistent with elevation of quiescent state characteristic of the molt in a model holometabolous insect.  "
negative,"An expansion of the dual clip-domain serine proteinase family in Manduca sexta: gene organization, expression, and evolution of prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-2, hemolymph proteinase 12, and other related proteinases. Prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases (PAPs) take part in insect defense responses including melanotic encapsulation and wound healing. To understand their gene structure and regulation, we screened a genomic library and isolated overlapping lambda clones for Manduca sexta PAP-2, hemolymph proteinase 12 (HP12), and HP24. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that all three genes encode polypeptides with two regulatory clip domains at the amino terminus, a linker region, and a catalytic serine proteinase domain at the carboxyl terminus. Each gene contains eight exons, with introns located at equivalent positions. Similar sequences are present in introns as well as exons, indicating that these genes arose from recent gene duplication and sequence divergence. We analyzed their 5' flanking sequences and identified putative immune and hormone responsive elements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions confirmed that PAP-2 and HP12 mRNA levels in the larval fat body and hemocytes increased after a bacterial challenge. However, HP24 expression was barely detected. PAP-2 transcripts in cultured fat body became less abundant after 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. Thus, PAP-2, HP12, and HP24 mRNA levels are differentially regulated by immune and developmental signals. Comparison with HP15, HP23, and PAP-3 sequences suggested an evolutionary pathway of the dual clip-domain serine proteinases in M. sexta. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Ceratitis capitata has been determined. The circular genome is 15 980 bp long and contains a standard gene complement, i.e. the large and small ribosomal RNA subunits, twenty-two transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and thirteen genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. When comparing the sequence to fragments previously sequenced from other isolates it becomes apparent that interstrain polymorphisms are not rare. These differences are potentially useful for the development of diagnostic tools for population analysis applications, such as determining the source of recent introductions. Moreover, they could help obtain a solution to the long-lasting controversy on the possible eradication of the Medfly from certain locations. "
negative,"Stimulation of polydnavirus replication by 20-hydroxyecdysone. During oviposition the endoparasitic wasp Campoletis sonorensis, introduces a polydnavirus into parasitized insects where viral gene expression is required for endoparasite survival. The polydnavirus is integrated into wasp chromosomal DNA and replicates only in the ovary. Ecdysteroids regulate the developmental expression of many insect genes and may regulate polydnavirus replication. Direct verification of viral replication was performed by dot blot hybridization and by amplifying DNA sequences containing the viral integration site; this 'junction' fragment cannot be amplified from integrated virus. Thoracic ligations and in vitro ecdysteroid treatments of wasp ovaries support the hypothesis that polydnavirus DNA replication is regulated by ecdysteroid during parasite development. "
negative,"Insect herbivory elicits genome-wide alternative splicing responses in Nicotiana attenuata. Changes in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) are involved in many responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in eukaryotic organisms. In response to attack and oviposition by insect herbivores, plants elicit rapid changes in gene expression which are essential for the activation of plant defenses; however, the herbivory-induced changes in AS remain unstudied. Using mRNA sequencing, we performed a genome-wide analysis on tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) feeding-induced AS in both leaves and roots of Nicotiana attenuata. Feeding by M. sexta for 5 h reduced total AS events by 7.3% in leaves but increased them in roots by 8.0% and significantly changed AS patterns in leaves and roots of existing AS genes. Feeding by M. sexta also resulted in increased (in roots) and decreased (in leaves) transcript levels of the serine / arginine-rich (SR) proteins that are involved in the AS machinery of plants and induced changes in SR gene expression that were jasmonic acid (JA)-independent in leaves but JA-dependent in roots. Changes in AS and gene expression elicited by M. sexta feeding were regulated independently in both tissues. This study provides genome-wide evidence that insect herbivory induces changes not only in the levels of gene expression but also in their splicing, which might contribute to defense against and / or tolerance of herbivory.  "
negative,"Reliable protocols for whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum: a comprehensive survey and analysis. RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), including chromogenic ISH (CISH) and fluorescent ISH (FISH), has become a powerful tool for revealing the spatial distribution of gene transcripts in model organisms. Previously, we developed a robust protocol for whole-mount RNA CISH in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, an emerging insect genomic model. In order to improve the resolving capacity of gene detection, we comprehensively surveyed current protocols of whole-mount RNA-FISH and developed protocols that allow, using confocal microscopy, clearer visualization of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) - including those subcellularly localized and those with spatially overlapping expression. We find that Fast dye-based substrate fluorescence (SF), tyramide signal amplification (TSA), and TSA Plus all enable identifying gene expression thanks to multiplex amplification of fluorescent signals. By contrast, methods of direct fluorescence (DF) do not allow visualizing signals. Detection of a single gene target was achieved with SF and TSA Plus for most mRNAs, whereas TSA only allowed visualization of abundant transcripts such as Apvas1 and Appiwi2 in the germ cells. For detection of multiple gene targets using double FISH, we recommend: (i) TSA / TSA, rather than TSA Plus / TSA Plus for colocalized mRNAs abundantly expressed in germ cells, as proteinase K treatment can be omitted; and (ii) SF / TSA Plus for other gene targets such as Apen1 and Apen2 as inactivation of enzyme conjugates is not required. SF / SF is not ideal for double FISH experiments due to signal blurring. Based on these new conditions for RNA-FISH, we have obtained a better understanding of germline specification and embryonic segmentation in the pea aphid. We anticipate that the RNA-FISH protocols for the pea aphid may also be used for other aphids and possibly other insect species, thus expanding the range of species from which useful insights into development and evolution may be obtained.  "
negative,"The Bear Giant-Skipper genome suggests genetic adaptations to living inside yucca roots. Giant-Skippers (Megathymini) are unusual thick-bodied, moth-like butterflies whose caterpillars feed inside Yucca roots and Agave leaves. Giant-Skippers are attributed to the subfamily Hesperiinae and they are endemic to southern and mostly desert regions of the North American continent. To shed light on the genotypic determinants of their unusual phenotypic traits, we sequenced and annotated a draft genome of the largest Giant-Skipper species, the Bear (Megathymus ursus violae). The Bear skipper genome is the least heterozygous among sequenced Lepidoptera genomes, possibly due to much smaller population size and extensive inbreeding. Their lower heterozygosity helped us to obtain a high-quality genome with an N50 of 4.2 Mbp. The ~ 430 Mb genome encodes about 14000 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis supports placement of Giant-Skippers with Grass-Skippers (Hesperiinae). We find that proteins involved in odorant and taste sensing as well as in oxidative reactions have diverged significantly in Megathymus as compared to Lerema, another Grass-Skipper. In addition, the Giant-Skipper has lost several odorant and gustatory receptors and possesses many fewer (1 / 3-1 / 2 of other skippers) anti-oxidative enzymes. Such differences may be related to the unusual life style of Giant-Skippers: they do not feed as adults, and their caterpillars feed inside Yuccas and Agaves, which provide a source of antioxidants such as polyphenols. "
positive,"Isolation and expression analysis of a homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon gene in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. A full-length 14-3-3 gene homolog (also referred to as the Px14-3-3 epsilon ""ε"" or Px14-3-3ε gene) was cloned from cDNA of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Px14-3-3 transcript is 789 nucleotides in length, and the predicted polypeptide is 263 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The Px14-3-3 gene contains the typical and predicted 14-3-3 domains and motifs. The amino acid sequence of the diamondback moth 14-3-3 gene is very similar to that of other insect epsilons (ε) but not to other insect zetas (ζ). In particular, the protein sequence of the Px14-3-3 gene shows high identity to the Bombyx mori epsilon (96.2%). Western blot analysis using an antibody against Px14-3-3ε verified the expression of 14-3-3ε in the larval, pupal, and adult stages. The Px14-3-3ε expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth instar larvae. Px14-3-3ε was detected in every tissue examined, including the body fat, hemocytes, brain, gut, and cuticle. "
negative,"A new mapping method for quantitative trait loci of silkworm. BACKGROUND: Silkworm is the basis of sericultural industry and the model organism in insect genetics study. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying economically important traits of silkworm is of high significance for promoting the silkworm molecular breeding and advancing our knowledge on genetic architecture of the Lepidoptera. Yet, the currently used mapping methods are not well suitable for silkworm, because of ignoring the recombination difference in meiosis between two sexes. RESULTS: A mixed linear model including QTL main effects, epistatic effects, and QTL × sex interaction effects was proposed for mapping QTLs in an F2 population of silkworm. The number and positions of QTLs were determined by F-test and model selection. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to estimate and test genetic effects of QTLs and QTL × sex interaction effects. The effectiveness of the model and statistical method was validated by a series of simulations. The results indicate that when markers are distributed sparsely on chromosomes, our method will substantially improve estimation accuracy as compared to the normal chiasmate F2 model. We also found that a sample size of hundreds was sufficiently large to unbiasedly estimate all the four types of epistases (i.e., additive-additive, additive-dominance, dominance-additive, and dominance-dominance) when the paired QTLs reside on different chromosomes in silkworm. CONCLUSION: The proposed method could accurately estimate not only the additive, dominance and digenic epistatic effects but also their interaction effects with sex, correcting the potential bias and precision loss in the current QTL mapping practice of silkworm and thus representing an important addition to the arsenal of QTL mapping tools. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome characteristics of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) and comparation with other Noctuoidea insects. In this study, mitogenome of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) were sequenced and compared with other Noctuoidea species. The mitogenome is 15,410 base pairs in length. All 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) are initiated by ATN codons except cox1 with CGA and all of PCGs terminate with TAA except nad4 with TAG. The codons ACG and CGC are absent. All the tRNA genes could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure except the trnS1 which not only loses dihydrouridine (DHU) arm but also mutates its anticodon into TCT. In the AT-rich region of the mitogenome the motif 'ATAGA' mutates to 'ATATA' and two copies of 161 bp-tandem repeats and two 'TA' short tandem repeats are founded. Phylogenetic analyses showed that S. scintillans is clustered into subfamily Lymatriinae. The phylogenetic relationships within Noctuoidea is (((Nolidae + (Euteliidae + Noctuidae)) + Erebidae) + Notodontidae). "
positive,"Isolation and molecular characterization of Musca domestica delta-9 desaturase sequences. We have isolated fatty acyl-CoA desaturase cDNA (Mdomd9) and genomic sequences from the housefly, Musca domestica. Two approximately 1.66 kb cDNAs were recovered. They had identical coding regions and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but differed in their 5' UTRs. The open reading frame encodes a 380 amino acid (aa) protein with 82% identity to Drosophila melanogaster desat1, and significant (> 50%) identity with other insect delta-9 desaturases. Functional analyses in a yeast expression system confirmed the cDNA encodes a delta9 desaturase. Northern analysis indicated two transcripts of 1.7 and 2.9 kb that hybridized specifically to the open reading frame. PCR amplification of genomic templates revealed three intron sites that are conserved among other insect species. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicated at least two desaturase gene copies per haploid genome. There is a high degree of polymorphism, most of which appears to be due to variable intron sequences; curiously, individual flies had varying morphs of intron II and intron III. Together, the data suggest that there are more delta9 desaturase alleles within the population studied than there are loci within the genome, and support other studies suggesting that insect fatty acyl-CoA desaturases are a dynamically evolving gene family. "
negative,"A molecular and genomic reference system for conifer defence against insects. Insect pests are part of natural forest ecosystems contributing to forest rejuvenation but can also cause ecological disturbance and economic losses that are expected to increase with climate change. The white pine or spruce weevil (Pissodes strobi) is a pest of conifer forests in North America. Weevil-host interactions with various spruce (Picea) species have been explored as a genomic and molecular reference system for conifer defence against insects. Interactions occur in two major phases of the insect life cycle. In the exophase, adult weevils are free-moving and display behaviour of host selection for oviposition that is affected by host traits. In the endophase, insects live within the host where mobility and development from eggs to young adults are affected by a complex system of host defences. Genetic resistance exists in several spruce species and involves synergism of constitutive and induced chemical and physical defences that comprise the conifer defence syndrome. Here, we review conifer defences that disrupt the weevil life cycle and mechanisms by which trees resist weevil attack. We highlight molecular and genomic aspects and a possible role for the weevil microbiome. Knowledge of this conifer defence system is supporting forest health strategies and tree breeding for insect resistance. "
negative,"Characterization of Adult Transcriptomes from the Omnivorous Lady Beetle Coleomegilla maculata Fed Pollen or Insect Egg Diet. Diet, nutrition, and obesity are important topics of current research. While many insect genome and / or transcriptome models are based on dietary specialists, the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata, a common New World species, is highly omnivorous. C. maculata feeds on plants, fungi, insects and other arthropods; its diet frequently includes conspecific cannibalism. This study reports and discusses the first nutritionally based C. maculata transcriptomes. These transcriptomes were prepared from highly inbred specimens provided limited diets, after adult eclosion, of either pollen only or eggs of a soft bodied hemipteran insect only. Selected sequences from the transcriptomes were compared to verify basic genetic similarity of the sampled individuals. Differentially expressed genes associated with these diets were identified to aid with studies of omnivore diet and nutrition. Selected transcriptome sequences described herein are filed with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), GenBank Bioproject PRJNA236444.  "
negative,"Power, resolution and bias: recent advances in insect phylogeny driven by the genomic revolution. Our understanding on the phylogenetic relationships of insects has been revolutionised in the last decade by the proliferation of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS). NGS has allowed insect systematists to assemble very large molecular datasets that include both model and non-model organisms. Such datasets often include a large proportion of the total number of protein coding sequences available for phylogenetic comparison. We review some early entomological phylogenomic studies that employ a range of different data sampling protocols and analyses strategies, illustrating a fundamental renaissance in our understanding of insect evolution all driven by the genomic revolution. The analysis of phylogenomic datasets is challenging because of their size and complexity, and it is obvious that the increasing size alone does not ensure that phylogenetic signal overcomes systematic biases in the data. Biases can be due to various factors such as the method of data generation and assembly, or intrinsic biological feature of the data per se, such as similarities due to saturation or compositional heterogeneity. Such biases often cause violations in the underlying assumptions of phylogenetic models. We review some of the bioinformatics tools available and being developed to detect and minimise systematic biases in phylogenomic datasets. Phylogenomic-scale data coupled with sophisticated analyses will revolutionise our understanding of insect functional genomics. This will illuminate the relationship between the vast range of insect phenotypic diversity and underlying genetic diversity. In combination with rapidly developing methods to estimate divergence times, these analyses will also provide a compelling view of the rates and patterns of lineagenesis (birth of lineages) over the half billion years of insect evolution. "
positive,"Environmental dissemination of mcr-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae by Chrysomya spp. (common blowfly): An increasing public health risk. Until recently, the role of insects, and particularly flies, in disseminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been poorly studied. In this study, we screened blowflies (Chrysomya spp.) from different areas near the city of Phitsanulok, Northern Thailand, for the presence of AMR genes and in particular, mcr-1, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). In total, 48 mcr-1-positive isolates were recovered, consisting of 17 mcr-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (MCRPKP) and 31 mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) strains. The 17 MCRPKP were shown to be clonal (ST43) with few single poly nucleomorphs (SNPs) by WGS analysis. In in-vitro models, the MCRPKP were shown to be highly virulent. In contrast, 31 recovered MCRPEC isolates are varied, belonging to 12 different sequence types shared with those causing human infections. The majority of mcr-1 gene are located on IncX4 plasmids (29 / 48, 60.42%), sharing an identical plasmid backbone. These findings highlight the contribution of flies to the AMR contagion picture in low- and middle-income countries and the challenges of tackling global AMR. "
positive,"The insect ecdysone receptor is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control. RNA interference (RNAi) has great potential for use in insect pest control. However, some significant challenges must be overcome before RNAi-based pest control can become a reality. One challenge is the proper selection of a good target gene for RNAi. Here, we report that the insect ecdysone receptor (EcR) is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a serious insect pest of rice plants. We demonstrated that the use of a 360 bp fragment (NlEcR-c) that is common between NlEcR-A and NlEcR-B for feeding RNAi experiments significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of NlEcR compared with those in the dsGFP control. Feeding RNAi also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of offspring per pair of N. lugens. Consequently, a transgenic rice line expressing NlEcR dsRNA was constructed by Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the total copy number of the target gene in all transgenic rice lines was 2. Northern blot analysis showed that the small RNA of the hairpin dsNlEcR-c was successfully expressed in the transgenic rice lines. After newly hatched nymphs of N. lugens fed on the transgenic rice lines, effective RNAi was observed. The NlEcR expression levels in all lines examined were decreased significantly compared with the control. In all lines, the survival rate of the nymphs was nearly 90%, and the average number of offspring per pair in the treated groups was significantly less than that observed in the control, with a decrease of 44.18-66.27%. These findings support an RNAi-based pest control strategy and are also important for the management of rice insect pests.  "
negative,"Genome-wide patterns of polymorphism in an inbred line of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Anopheles gambiae is a major mosquito vector of malaria in Africa. Although increased use of insecticide-based vector control tools has decreased malaria transmission, elimination is likely to require novel genetic control strategies. It can be argued that the absence of an A. gambiae inbred line has slowed progress toward genetic vector control. In order to empower genetic studies and enable precise and reproducible experimentation, we set out to create an inbred line of this species. We found that amenability to inbreeding varied between populations of A. gambiae. After full-sib inbreeding for ten generations, we genotyped 112 individuals--56 saved prior to inbreeding and 56 collected after inbreeding--at a genome-wide panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although inbreeding dramatically reduced diversity across much of the genome, we discovered numerous, discrete genomic blocks that maintained high heterozygosity. For one large genomic region, we were able to definitively show that high diversity is due to the persistent polymorphism of a chromosomal inversion. Inbred lines in other eukaryotes often exhibit a qualitatively similar retention of polymorphism when typed at a small number of markers. Our whole-genome SNP data provide the first strong, empirical evidence supporting associative overdominance as the mechanism maintaining higher than expected diversity in inbred lines. Although creation of A. gambiae lines devoid of nearly all polymorphism may not be feasible, our results provide critical insights into how more fully isogenic lines can be created. "
positive,"Systemic RNAi of V-ATPase subunit B causes molting defect and developmental abnormalities in Periplaneta fuliginosa. The vacuolar (H+ )-ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven proton pumps with multiple functions in many organisms. In this study, we performed structural and functional analysis of vha55 gene that encodes V-ATPase subunit B in the smokybrown cockroach Periplaneta fuliginosa (Blattodea). We observed a high homology score of the deduced amino acid sequences between 10 species in seven orders. RNAi of the vha55 gene in P. fuliginosa caused nymphal / nymphal molting defects with incomplete shedding of old cuticles, growth inhibition, as well as bent and wrinkled cuticles of thoraxes and abdominal segments. Since growth inhibition caused by vha55 RNAi did not interfere in the commencement of cockroach molting, molting timing and body growth might be controlled by independent mechanism. Our study suggested V-ATPases might be a good candidate molecule for evolutionary and developmental studies of insect molting. "
negative,"First genome analysis and molecular characterization of Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus Egyptian isolate infecting squash. This study aims to identifying and characterizing some molecular properties of geminiviruses co-infection in squash field crop cultivated in Egypt. Squash crops observed to be heavily infected with several insect vectors, also severe chlorosis and stunting was observed. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed geminate capsid particles which indicate the infection of Geminiviruses, especially SqLCV which represent an economic problem to squash filed crop in Egypt. We have investigated possible mixed infections with different plant viruses associated with chlorotic stunt diseases and or other genus groups of geminiviruses. The main objective of this study is to investigate the recombination events, possible recombinants and variants among these genera in the same family differing in vector transmission. This is the first report of the molecular characterization, phylogenetic analysis and putative recombination events of the full length genome of the Chickpea Chlorotic Dwarf Mastrevirus in Egypt. And the first report of co-infection with another begomovirus infecting squash plants. A full length clone of both viruses were isolated and characterized at the molecular level. The complete nucleotide sequence of DNA-A was determined (2,572 bp) and submitted to the genbank under accession no. KF692356. The isolate from Egypt has about 97.8 % homology with the Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV) isolate from Syria DNA-A isolate FR687959, a 83.2 % homology with the Sudan isolate AM933134 and a 82.7 % homology with Pakistan isolate FR687960. To best of our knowledge this is the first report of complete genome of CpCDV that infect squash plants in Egypt and worldwide.  "
positive,"Identification, expression and function of myosin heavy chain family genes in Tribolium castaneum. Functions of myosin heavy chain (myosin) family genes are poorly understood in some insects. To address this, we determined the expression and function of myosin family genes in Tribolium castaneum. TcMyo15 is predominantly expressed in early embryos, late larvae and early adults, but TcMyo7B transcripts significantly increased in late larvae. TcMyo20 transcripts are abundant in pre-adults, whereas TcMhc1 is highly expressed in post-embryonic stages. TcMhc2 shows peak expression in late pupae. TcMyo9 transcripts reached their highest levels in late pupae. TcMyo15, TcMyo7B and TcMhc2 are abundantly expressed in the adult epidermis, gut and testis, respectively. TcMyo9 and TcMyo20 are highly expressed in the epidermis, fat body and ovary, and TcMhc1 exhibits high mRNA levels in the epidermis and accessory gland. TcMyo20 RNAi reduced wing and leg size, fertility and egg hatchability. TcMyo9 knockdown completely inhibited eclosion and fecundity, but TcMyo15 or TcMhc1 silencing only impaired eclosion. TcMhc2 RNAi affected pupation and wing development. This study suggests myosin genes as potential targets of pesticides due to their critical roles in insect development and reproduction. "
negative,"Beet poleroviruses: close friends or distant relatives? UNLABELLED: SUMMARY Taxonomy: There are three members of the genus Polerovirus (family Luteoviridae) that induce yellowing of sugar beet: Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV), Beet chlorosis virus (BChV) and Beet western yellows virus-USA (BWYV-USA, Fig. 1). Non-beet-infecting isolates of BWYV found particularly within Europe have now been re-named Turnip yellows virus (TuYV). Species-specific antibodies are unavailable, but the viruses can be distinguished by RT-PCR using primers specifically designed to the 5' end of their respective genomes. Physical properties: The isometric virus particles are approximately 26 nm in diameter and the genome consists of a single strand of positive sense RNA that utilizes almost all known plant virus gene expression strategies (initiation bypass, translational frameshifting and readthrough, synthesis of subgenomic RNA and proteolytic processing). HOST RANGE: Many members of the Chenopodiaceae are susceptible, including commercial crops of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), red beet and spinach. Experimental hosts include Montia perfoliata, Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. SYMPTOMS: Sugar beet infected with beet poleroviruses show patches of chlorosis on the older leaves 4-6 weeks post-infection; these areas expand until the whole leaf becomes yellow and older leaves then tend to thicken and become brittle. TRANSMISSION: Beet poleroviruses are transmitted in a persistent (circulative, non-propagative) manner by several different aphid species, Myzus persicae being the most important vector. "
negative,"Analysis of ESTs from Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies and their contribution toward understanding the insect-parasite relationship. An expressed sequence tag library has been generated from a sand fly vector of visceral leishmaniasis, Lutzomyia longipalpis. A normalized cDNA library was constructed from whole adults and 16,608 clones were sequenced from both ends and assembled into 10,203 contigs and singlets. Of these 58% showed significant similarity to known genes from other organisms, <4% were identical to described sand fly genes, and 42% had no match to any database sequence. Our analyses revealed putative proteins involved in the barrier function of the gut (peritrophins, microvillar proteins, glutamine synthase), digestive physiology (secreted and membrane-anchored hydrolytic enzymes), and the immune response (gram-negative binding proteins, thioester proteins, scavenger receptors, galectins, signaling pathway factors, caspases, serpins, and peroxidases). Sequence analysis of this transcriptome dataset has provided new insights into genes that might be associated with the response of the vector to the development of Leishmania. "
positive,"An Overview of Embryogenesis: External Morphology and Transcriptome Profiling in the Hemipteran Insect Nilaparvata lugens. During embryogenesis of insects, the morphological and transcriptional changes are important signatures to obtain a better understanding of insect patterning and evolution. The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is a serious insect pest of rice plants, but its embryogenesis has not uncovered. Here, we described embryonic development process of the pest and found it belongs to an intermediate-germ mode. The RNA-seq data from different times (6, 30, 96, and 150 h, after egg laying) of embryogenesis were then analyzed, and a total of 10,895 genes were determined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on pairwise comparisons. Afterward, 1,898 genes, differentially expressed in at least two comparisons of adjacent embryonic stages were divided into 10 clusters using K means cluster analysis (KMCA). Eight-gene modules were established using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression patterns in the different embryonic stages were identified by combining the functional enrichments of the stage-specific clusters and modules, which displayed the expression level and reprogramming of multiple developmental genes during embryogenesis. The ""hub"" genes at each embryonic stage with possible crucial roles were identified. Notably, we found a ""center"" set of genes that were related to overall membrane functions and might play important roles in the embryogenesis process. After parental RNAi of the MSTRG.3372, the hub gene, the embryo was observed as abnormal. Furthermore, some homologous genes in classic embryonic development processes and signaling pathways were also involved in embryogenesis of this insect. An improved comprehensive finding of embryogenesis within the N. lugens reveals better information on genetic and genomic studies of embryonic development and might be a potential target for RNAi-based control of this insect pest. "
positive,"Evaluation of potential RNA-interference-target genes to control cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcuidae). RNA interference (RNAi) of vital insect genes is a potential tool for targeted pest control. However, selection of the right target genes is a challenge because the RNAi efficacy is known to vary among insect species. Cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis, is a phloem-feeding economically important crop pest. We evaluated the RNAi of 2 vital genes, Bursicon (PsBur) and V-ATPase (PsV-ATPase) as potential targets in P. solenopsis for its control. PCR fragments of PsBur and PsV-ATPase were amplified using cDNA synthesized from the total RNA. The PCR amplicons were cloned into Potato virus X (PVX) to develop recombinant PVX for the inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum plants for bioassays with healthy P. solenopsis. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the expression of transgenes in the recombinant-PVX-inoculated plants (treated), and suppression of the target genes in the mealybugs exposed to them. The RT-PCR confirmed the expression of transgenes in the treated plants. Mealybug individuals on treated plants either died or showed physical deformities. Further, the population of mealybug was significantly reduced by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggers against PsBur and PsV-ATPase. The results conclude that RNAi is activated in P. solenopsis by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggering elements of PsBur and PsV-ATPase genes through recombinant PVX vector. Further, V-ATPase and Bursicon genes are potential targets for RNAi-mediated control of P. solenopsis. "
negative,"EST-based gene indices for the cattle fever tick, the horn fly, and the screwworm fly. The southern cattle tick, Rhip,cephalus (Boophilus) microplus, the horn fly, Haematobia irritans, and the New World screwworm, Cochl,omyia hominivorax, are economically important parasites of cattle throughout the world. Understanding the biology and genomics of these pests is critical to developing novel control methods. We developed EST sequence databases for these parasites and used bioinformatic analysis to identify conceptual open reading frames and assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms to those database transcripts that had informative BlasIX hits. Bloinformatic analysis showed that a large fraction of the tick database entries have no clear matches in other sequenced genomes. Several putative tick G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified that mightserve as starting points to develop novel control technologies. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of odorant-binding proteins in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. Olfaction contributes to many crucial behaviors in insects, such as foraging, locating hosts, mating, and avoiding predators. In the first step of the olfaction process in insects, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) bind with the odorants and transport hydrophobic odorants. OBPs are also believed to accelerate the termination of the odorant response. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is one of the most destructive fruit-eating pests, causing enormous economic losses to the fruit and vegetable industry worldwide. However, information relating to the number, diversity, and expression patterns of OBPs still remains fragmented in this insect pest. Here, we attempted to identify the OBPs in B. dorsalis using genomic and transcriptomic information. In this study, we expanded the repository of B. dorsalis OBPs to 49. Phylogenetic analysis of BdorOBPs with other species revealed that these proteins grouped into four subfamilies. Furthermore, we determined the expression profiles in six body parts (namely, the legs, wings, antenna, cuticles of the head, thorax, and abdomen) and five internal tissues (namely, the fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubule, testis, and ovary). The results indicated that 21 BdorOBPs showed high expression levels in the antenna, legs, and head cuticles and may thus perform olfactory functions, which corroborates previous evidence. Two BdorOBPs were specifically expressed in the abdomen cuticles. Nineteen OBPs were highly expressed in the fat body, while four OBPs were highly expressed in the reproductive organs. This indicated that they may have physiological roles other than in chemoreception. In summary, our results contribute to the knowledge base of insect OBPs and provide a foundation for the further study of the molecular mechanisms of chemoreception in B. dorsalis. "
positive,"NlATG1 Gene Participates in Regulating Autophagy and Fission of Mitochondria in the Brown Planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Autophagy plays multiple roles in regulating various physiological processes in cells. However, we currently lack a systematic analysis of autophagy and the autophagy-related gene 1 ATG1 in the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), one of the most destructive of the insect pests of rice. In this study, the full-length cDNA of an autophagy-related gene, NlATG1, was cloned from BPH. Real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that this NlATG1 gene was expressed differently across developmental stages, at higher levels in nymphs but lower levels in adults. RNA interference with dsNlATG1 significantly decreased the mRNA level of the target gene to 14.6% at day 4 compared with that of the dsGFP control group. The survival of the dsNlATG1-treated group decreased significantly from day 4 onward, dropping to 48.3% on day 8. Examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that epithelial cells of the BPH's midgut in the dsNlATG1-treated group had less autophagic vacuoles than did the dsGFP control, and knockdown of NlATG1 clearly inhibited the starvation-induced autophagy response in this insect. RNA interference of NlATG1 upregulated the NlFis1 gene involved in mitochondrial fission, leading to reductions in mitochondrial width and area. Furthermore, knockdown of NlATG1 also decreased the ATP content and accumulation of glycogen. Together, these results demonstrate that the NlATG1 gene participates in regulating autophagy and fission of mitochondria in the brown planthopper, making it a potentially promising target for pest control given its key role in autophagy, including maintaining the normal structure and function of mitochondria. "
negative,"Abundant nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) in the Aedes aegypti genome. A portion of the Aedes aegypti mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene (ND4) was amplified using PCR with a 42 degrees C annealing temperature. Amplified fragments from individual mosquitoes were similar to ND4 but contained multiple segregating sites. We suspected that nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) exist in the Ae. aegypti genome. A BlastN search in VectorBase with the entire Ae. aegypti mitochondrial genome identified 233 NUMTs comprising 110 178 bp in 145 supercontigs. At a density of 0.080 bp / kb, this represents the second highest density of NUMTs in an insect genome and the highest in Diptera. Analyses of flanking sequences suggested that Ae. aegypti NUMTs arise through mtDNA leakage from damaged mitochondria followed by breakage and nonhomologous recombination, rather than through duplicative processes such as transposition or molecular drive. "
negative,"Genomic origins of insect sex chromosomes. Recent efforts to catalog the diversity of sex chromosome systems coupled with genome sequencing projects are adding a new level of resolution to our understanding of insect sex chromosome origins. Y-chromosome degeneration makes sequencing difficult and may erase homology so rapidly that their origins will often remain enigmatic. X-chromosome origins are better understood, but thus far prove to be remarkably labile, often lacking homology even among close relatives. Furthermore, evidence now suggests that differentiated X or Y-chromosomes may both revert to autosomal inheritance. Data for ZW systems is scarcer, but W and Y-chromosomes seem to share many characteristics. Limited evidence suggests that Z-chromosome homology is more conserved than X counterparts, but broader sampling of both sex chromosome systems is needed. "
negative,"Genomic consequences of background effects on scalloped mutant expressivity in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic background effects contribute to the phenotypic consequences of mutations and are pervasive across all domains of life that have been examined, yet little is known about how they modify genetic systems. In part this is due to the lack of tractable model systems that have been explicitly developed to study the genetic and evolutionary consequences of background effects. In this study we demonstrate that phenotypic expressivity of the scalloped(E3) (sd(E3)) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is background dependent and is the result of at least one major modifier segregating between two standard lab wild-type strains. We provide evidence that at least one of the modifiers is linked to the vestigial region and demonstrate that the background effects modify the spatial distribution of known sd target genes in a genotype-dependent manner. In addition, microarrays were used to examine the consequences of genetic background effects on the global transcriptome. Expression differences between wild-type strains were found to be as large as or larger than the effects of mutations with substantial phenotypic effects, and expression differences between wild type and mutant varied significantly between genetic backgrounds. Significantly, we demonstrate that the epistatic interaction between sd(E3) and an optomotor blind mutation is background dependent. The results are discussed within the context of developing a complex but more realistic view of the consequences of genetic background effects with respect to mutational analysis and studies of epistasis and cryptic genetic variation segregating in natural populations. "
positive,"Silencing of CYP6 and APN Genes Affects the Growth and Development of Rice Yellow Stem Borer, Scirpophaga incertulas. RNAi is a powerful tool to target the insect genes involved in host-pest interactions. Key insect genes are the choice for silencing to achieve pest derived resistance where resistance genes are not available in gene pool of host plant. In this study, an attempt was made to determine the effect of dsRNA designed from two genes Cytochrome P450 derivative (CYP6) and Aminopeptidase N (APN) of rice yellow stem borer (YSB) on growth and development of insect. The bioassays involved injection of chemically synthesized 5' FAM labeled 21-nt dsRNA into rice cut stems and allowing the larvae to feed on these stems which resulted in increased mortality and observed growth and development changes in larval length and weight compared with its untreated control at 12-15 days after treatment. These results were further supported by observing the reduction in transcripts expression of these genes in treated larvae. Fluorescence detection in treated larvae also proved that dsRNA was readily taken by larvae when fed on dsRNA treated stems. These results from the present study clearly show that YSB larvae fed on dsRNA designed from Cytochrome P450 and Aminopeptidase N has detrimental effect on larval growth and development. These genes can be deployed to develop YSB resistance in rice using RNAi approach.  "
negative,"Investigation of the contribution of RyR target-site mutations in diamide resistance by CRISPR / Cas9 genome modification in Drosophila. Diamide insecticides are used widely against lepidopteran pests, acting as potent activators of insect Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) and thus inducing muscle contraction and eventually death. However, resistant phenotypes have recently evolved in the field, associated with the emergence of target site resistance mutations (G4946E / V and I4790M). We investigated the frequency of the mutations found in a resistant population of Tuta absoluta from Greece (G4946V ~79% and I4790M ~21%) and the associated diamide resistance profile: there are very high levels of resistance against chlorantraniliprole (9329-fold) and flubendiamide (4969-fold), but moderate levels against cyantraniliprole (191-fold). To further investigate functionally the contribution of each mutation in the resistant phenotype, we used CRISPR / Cas9 to generate genome modified Drosophila carrying alternative allele combinations, and performed toxicity bioassays against all three diamides. Genome modified flies bearing the G4946V mutation exhibited high resistance ratios to flubendiamide (91.3-fold) and chlorantraniliprole (194.7-fold) when compared to cyantraniliprole (5.4-fold). Flies naturally wildtype for the I4790M mutation were moderately resistant to flubendiamide (15.3-fold) but significantly less resistant to chlorantraniliprole (7.5-fold), and cyantraniliprole (2.3-fold). These findings provide in vivo functional genetic confirmation for the role and relative contribution of RyR mutations in diamide resistance and suggest that the mutations confer subtle differences on the relative binding affinities of the three diamides at an overlapping binding site on the RyR protein. "
positive,"Genomic organization and regulation of three cecropin genes in Anopheles gambiae. Three cecropin genes (AgCecA-C) were identified from Anopheles gambiae, a major vector for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. These genes form a cluster with AgCecA and AgCecB positioned in opposite orientation, while AgCecC is downstream of AgCecA in the same direction. One intron is present in each of these three genes. Motif searches of promoter regions revealed elements that could be regulated by the NF-kappaB family of transcriptional regulators. The divergent promoter (1186 nucleotides in length) between CecA and CecB and the promoter for CecC were analysed by transfection in An. gambiae cell lines. Results showed that these promoters were up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide. The activity was further elevated when heat-inactivated microbes were used to challenge the cell line. At least one NF-kappaB site was required for inducible expression of both CecA and CecB. "
positive,"Cloning and characterization of a 70 kDa heat shock cognate gene (HSC70) from two species of Chironomus. In the present study we carried out the isolation and characterization of an HSC70 gene from two midges, Chironomus tentans and C. yoshimatsui. The HSC70 cDNAs are approximately 2424 (C. tentans) and 2464 bp (C. yoshimatsui) long, and contain 1950 and 1956 bp open reading frames, respectively. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of two introns in these genes. The 5' untranslated regions of the HSC70 genes are adenosine-rich, a feature found in inducible HSP70 genes. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences exhibit high identity with cytosolic HSC70s from other Dipterans. Northern hybridization indicated that HSC70 is expressed at all developmental stages, from embryo to adult, and Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of multiple HSP70 genes in Chironomus. "
negative,"Inheritance of resistance to acrinathrin in Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). BACKGROUND: The western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is an economically important pest. The genetic basis of acrinathrin resistance was investigated in WFT. RESULTS: The resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for acrinathrin resistance from a pool of thrips populations collected in Almeria (south-eastern Spain), showed a high resistance to acrinathrin (43-fold based on LC(50) values) compared with the laboratory susceptible strain. Mortality data from reciprocal crosses of resistant and susceptible thrips indicated that resistance was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects. Analysis of probit lines from the parental strains and reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was expressed as a codominant trait. To determine the number of genes involved, a direct test of monogenic inheritance based on the backcrosses suggested that resistance to acrinathrin was probably controlled by one locus. Another approach, which was based on phenotypic variances, showed n(E), or the minimum number of freely segregating genetic factors for the resistant strain, to be 0.79. CONCLUSION: The results showed that acrinathrin resistance in WFT was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects, and was expressed as a codominant trait, probably controlled by one locus. "
negative,"Molecular and genomic basis of volatile-mediated indirect defense against insects in rice. Rice plants fed on by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) caterpillars emit a blend of volatiles dominated by terpenoids. These volatiles were highly attractive to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Microarray analysis identified 196 rice genes whose expression was significantly upregulated by FAW feeding, 18 of which encode metabolic enzymes potentially involved in volatile biosynthesis. Significant induction of expression of seven of the 11 terpene synthase (TPS) genes identified through the microarray experiments was confirmd using real-time RT-PCR. Enzymes encoded by three TPS genes, Os02g02930, Os08g07100 and Os08g04500, were biochemically characterized. Os02g02930 was found to encode a monoterpene synthase producing the single product S-linalool, which is the most abundant volatile emitted from FAW-damaged rice plants. Both Os08g07100 and Os08g04500 were found to encode sesquiterpene synthases, each producing multiple products. These three enzymes are responsible for production of the majority of the terpenes released from FAW-damaged rice plants. In addition to TPS genes, several key genes in the upstream terpenoid pathways were also found to be upregulated by FAW feeding. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of FAW-induced volatiles and the corresponding volatile biosynthetic genes potentially involved in indirect defense in rice. Evolution of the genetic basis governing volatile terpenoid biosynthesis for indirect defense is discussed. "
positive,"Characterisation, analysis of expression and localisation of the opsin gene repertoire from the perspective of photoperiodism in the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Organisms exhibit a wide range of seasonal responses as adaptions to predictable annual changes in their environment. These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth's cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include floration, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain. Clear differences in expression patterns were found, thus relating opsin expression with the photoperiodic response. "
negative,"Identification of insect genes involved in baculovirus AcMNPV entry into insect cells. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is a model enveloped DNA virus that infects and replicates in lepidopteran insect cells, and can efficiently enter a wide variety of non-host cells. Budded virions of AcMNPV enter cells by endocytosis and traffic to the nucleus where the virus initiates gene expression and genome replication. While trafficking of nucleocapsids by actin propulsion has been studied in detail, other important components of trafficking during entry remain poorly understood. We used a recombinant AcMNPV virus expressing an EGFP reporter in combination with an RNAi screen in Drosophila DL1 cells, to identify host proteins involved in AcMNPV entry. The RNAi screen targeted 86 genes involved in vesicular trafficking, including genes coding for VPS and ESCRT proteins, Rab GTPases, Exocyst proteins, and Clathrin adaptor proteins. We identified 24 genes required for efficient virus entry and reporter expression, and 4 genes that appear to restrict virus entry. "
positive,"Metabolism of selected model substrates and insecticides by recombinant CYP6FD encoded by its gene predominately expressed in the brain of Locusta migratoria. The migratory locust, Locusta migartoria, is a major agricultural insect pest and its resistance to insecticides is becoming more prevalent. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are important enzymes for biotransformations of various endogenous and xenobiotic substances. These enzymes play a major role in developing insecticide resistance in many insect species. In this study, we heterologously co-expressed a CYP enzyme (CYP6FD1) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from L. migartoria in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for metabolic activity towards six selected model substrates (luciferin-H, luciferin-Me, luciferin-Be, luciferin-PFBE, luciferin-CEE and 7-ethoxycoumarin), and four selected insecticides (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and methoprene). Recombinant CYP6FD1 showed activity towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and luciferin-Me, but no detectable activity towards the other luciferin derivatives. Furthermore, the enzyme efficiently oxidized deltamethrin to hydroxydeltamethrin through an aromatic hydroxylation in a time-dependent manner. However, the enzyme did not show any detectable activity towards the other three insecticides. Our results provide direct evidence that CYP6FD1 is capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. This work is a step towards a more complete characterization of the catalytic capabilities of CYP6FD1 and other xenobiotic metabolizing CYP enzymes in L. migratoria. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis HS18-1. Bacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium that is a type of insect pathogen used in the field of microbial insect control. B. thuringiensis HS18-1 has effective toxicity for Lepidoptera and Diptera insects. It contains different types of parasporal crystal genes, including cry4Cb1, cry50Aa1, cry69Ab1, cry30Ga, cry30Ea, cry70Aa, cry71Aa, cry72Aa, cry56Aa and cry54Ba. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of B. thuringiensis HS18-1, which contains one circular gapless chromosome and nine circular plasmids.  "
negative,"Transcriptomics and functional genomics of plant defence induction by phloem-feeding insects. The relationship between phloem-feeding insects (PFIs) and plants offers an intriguing example of a highly specialized biotic interaction. These insects have evolved to survive on a nutritionally imbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to minimize wound responses in their host plants. As a consequence, plant perception of and responses to PFIs differ from plant interactions with other insect-feeding guilds. Transcriptome-wide analyses of gene expression are currently being applied to characterize plant responses to PFIs in crop plants with race-specific innate resistance, as well as in compatible interactions with susceptible hosts. Recent studies indicate that PFIs induce transcriptional reprogramming in their host plants, and that plant responses to PFIs appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from responses to other insects or pathogens. Transcript profiling studies also suggest that PFIs induce cell wall modifications, reduce photosynthetic activity, manipulate source-sink relations, and modify secondary metabolism in their hosts, and many of these responses appear to occur within the phloem tissue. Plant responses to these insects appear to be regulated in part by the salicylate, jasmonate, and ethylene signalling pathways. As additional transcript profiling data become available, forward and reverse genetic approaches will be necessary to determine which changes in gene expression influence resistance or susceptibility to PFIs. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). The entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule was 15,314 bp long. The C. raphaelis genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely sequenced mitogenomes of other lepidopteran species, except for the presence of an extra copy of tRNA(Ser)(AGN). High similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between the two tandemly located copies of the tRNA(Ser)(AGN) suggest a recent duplication of an original single tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The DHU arm of the two copies of tRNA(Ser)(AGN) formed a simple loop as seen in many other metazoan mt tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The putative initiation codon for the C. raphaelis COI gene appears to be a tetranucleotide, TTAG, found commonly in the sequenced lepidopterans. ATPase8, ATPase6, ND4L and ND6 genes, which are next to another protein-coding gene at their 3' end all had the sequences potential to form a hairpin structure, suggesting the importance of such a structure for precise cleavage of the mature protein-coding genes. "
positive,"Functional characterization of ultraspiracle in Leptinotarsa decemlineata using RNA interference assay. A heterodimer of ultraspiracle (USP) and ecdysone receptor (EcR) mediates 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling cascade to regulate insect moulting and metamorphosis. However, at least two questions remain to be addressed in terms of the molecular importance of USP in insect species. First, is USP involved in both regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis and mediation of 20E signalling in non-drosophilid insects, as in Drosophila melanogaster? Second, does USP play any role in larval metamorphosis except as the partner of heterodimeric receptor to activate the downstream 20E signalling genes? In this paper, we found that RNA interference (RNAi) of LdUSP in the final (fourth) instar larvae reduced the messenger RNA levels of four ecdysteroidogenesis genes (Ldspo, Ldphm, Lddib and Ldsad) and 20E titre, and repressed the expression of five 20E signal genes (EcRA, HR3, HR4, E74 and E75) in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The LdUSP RNAi larvae remained as prepupae, with developing antennae, legs and discs of forewings and hindwings. Dietary supplement with 20E restored the expression of the five 20E signal genes, but only partially alleviated the decreased pupation rate in LdUSP RNAi beetles. Knockdown of LdUSP at the penultimate (third) instar larvae did not affect third-fourth instar moulting. However, silencing LdUSP caused similar but less severe impairments on pupation. Accordingly, we propose that USP is undoubtedly necessary for ecdysteroidogenesis, for mediation of 20E signalling and for initiation of metamorphosis in L. decemlineata. "
negative,"A genome-scale protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 uncovers additional nodes of the human p53 network. The genome of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a single p53-like protein, phylogenetically related to the ancestor of the mammalian p53 family of tumor suppressors. We reasoned that a comprehensive map of the protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) might help identify conserved interactions of the entire p53 family in man. Using a genome-scale in vitro expression cloning approach, we identified 91 previously unreported Dmp53 interactors, considerably expanding the current Drosophila p53 interactome. Looking for evolutionary conservation of these interactions, we tested 41 mammalian orthologs and found that 37 bound to one or more p53-family members when overexpressed in human cells. An RNAi-based functional assay for modulation of the p53 pathway returned five positive hits, validating the biological relevance of these interactions. One p53 interactor is GTPBP4, a nucleolar protein involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that GTPBP4 knockdown induces p53 accumulation and activation in the absence of nucleolar disruption. In breast tumors with wild-type p53, increased expression of GTPBP4 correlates with reduced patient survival, emphasizing a potential relevance of this regulatory axis in cancer. "
negative,"Evolutionary and functional genetics of insect diapause: a call for greater integration. Diapause in response to seasonality is an important model for rapid evolutionary adaptation that is highly genetically variable, and experiences strong natural selection. Forward genetic methods using various genomic and transcriptomic approaches have begun to characterize the genetic architecture and candidate genes underlying diapause evolution. Largely in parallel, reverse genetic studies have identified functional roles for candidate genes that may or may not be genetically variable. We illustrate the disconnect between the evolutionary and physiological literature using a suite of studies of the role of the circadian clock in diapause regulation. These extensive studies in two different disciplines provide excellent opportunities for integration, which should facilitate rapid progress in understanding both the regulation and evolution of diapause. "
negative,"The evolution of novel host use is unlikely to be constrained by trade-offs or a lack of genetic variation. The genetic and ecological factors that shape the evolution of animal diets remain poorly understood. For herbivorous insects, the expectation has been that trade-offs exist, such that adaptation to one host plant reduces performance on other potential hosts. We investigated the genetic architecture of alternative host use by rearing individual Lycaeides melissa butterflies from two wild populations in a crossed design on two hosts (one native and one introduced) and analysing the genetic basis of differences in performance using genomic approaches. Survival during the experiment was highest when butterfly larvae were reared on their natal host plant, consistent with local adaptation. However, cross-host correlations in performance among families (within populations) were not different from zero. We found that L. melissa populations possess genetic variation for larval performance and variation in performance had a polygenic basis. We documented very few genetic variants with trade-offs that would inherently constrain diet breadth by preventing the optimization of performance across hosts. Instead, most genetic variants that affected performance on one host had little to no effect on the other host. In total, these results suggest that genetic trade-offs are not the primary cause of dietary specialization in L. melissa butterflies.  "
negative,"Studying the organization of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes in Chrysomela tremula provides insights into a leaf beetle genome. The ability of herbivorous beetles from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides has only recently begun to be appreciated. The presence of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in the beetle's digestive tract makes this degradation possible. Sequences encoding these beetle-derived PCWDEs were originally identified from transcriptomes and strikingly resemble those of saprophytic and phytopathogenic microorganisms, raising questions about their origin; e.g. are they insect- or microorganism-derived? To demonstrate unambiguously that the genes encoding PCWDEs found in beetle transcriptomes are indeed of insect origin, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the genome of the leaf beetle Chrysomela tremula, containing 18 432 clones with an average size of 143 kb. After hybridizing this library with probes derived from 12 C. tremula PCWDE-encoding genes and sequencing the positive clones, we demonstrated that the latter genes are encoded by the insect's genome and are surrounded by genes possessing orthologues in the genome of Tribolium castaneum as well as in three other beetle genomes. Our analyses showed that although the level of overall synteny between C. tremula and T. castaneum seems high, the degree of microsynteny between both species is relatively low, in contrast to the more closely related Colorado potato beetle.  "
negative,"An Anopheles stephensi Promoter-Trap: Augmenting Genome Annotation and Functional Genomics. The piggyBac transposon was modified to generate gene trap constructs, which were then incorporated into the genome of the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi and remobilized through genetic crosses using a piggyBac transposase expressing line. A total of 620 remobilization events were documented, and 73 were further characterized at the DNA level to identify patterns in insertion site preferences, remobilization frequencies, and remobilization patterns. Overall, the use of the tetameric AmCyan reporter as the fusion peptide displayed a preference for insertion into the 5'-end of transcripts. Notably 183 - 44882 bp upstream of the An. stephensi v1.0 ab initio gene models, which demonstrated that the promoter regions for the genes of An. stephensi are further upstream of the 5'-proximal regions of the genes in the ab inito models than may be otherwise predicted. RNA-Seq transcript coverage supported the insertion of the splice acceptor gene trap element into 5'-UTR introns for nearly half of all insertions identified. The use of a gene trap element that prefers insertion into the 5'-end of genes supports the use of this technology for the random generation of knock-out mutants, as well as the experimental confirmation of 5'-UTR introns in An. stephensi. "
positive,"Odorant reception in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor (AgOr) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets for controlling the transmission of malaria. "
negative,"Where the baculoviruses lead, the caterpillars follow: baculovirus-induced alterations in caterpillar behaviour. Baculoviruses are well-known for altering the behaviour of their caterpillar hosts by inducing hyperactivity (enhanced locomotion) and / or tree-top disease (climbing to elevated positions before death). These features, along with the genomic small size of baculoviruses compared to non-viral parasites and the at hand techniques for producing mutants, imply that baculoviruses are excellent tools for unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying parasitic alteration of host behaviour. Baculoviruses can be easily mutated, allowing an optimal experimental setup in comparative studies, where for instance host gene expression can be compared between insects infected with wild-type viruses or with mutant viruses lacking genes involved in behavioural manipulation. Recent studies have revealed the first insight into the underlying molecular pathways that lead to the typical behaviour of baculovirus-infected caterpillars and into the role of light therein. Since host behaviour in general is mediated through the host's central nervous system (CNS), a promising future step will be to study how baculoviruses regulate the neuronal activity of the host. "
positive,"Hh signaling from de novo organizers drive lgl neoplasia in Drosophila epithelium. The Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen regulates growth and patterning. Since Hh signaling is also implicated in carcinogenesis, it is conceivable that de novo Hh-secreting organizers, if formed in association with oncogenic hit could be tumor-cooperative. Here we validate this hypothesis using the Drosophila model of cooperative epithelial carcinogenesis. We generate somatic clones with simultaneous loss of tumor suppressor, Lgl, and gain of the posterior compartment selector, Engrailed (En), known to induce synthesis of Hh. We show that lgl UAS-en clones in the anterior wing compartment trigger Hh signaling cascade via cross-talk with their Ci-expressing wild type cell neighbors. Hh-Dpp signaling from clone boundaries of such ectopically formed de novo organizers in turn drive lgl carcinogenesis. By contrast, Ci-expressing lgl clones transform by autocrine and / or juxtracine activation of Hh signaling in only the posterior compartment. We further show that sequestration of the Hh ligand or loss of Dpp receptor, Tkv, in these Hh-sending or -receiving lgl clones arrested their carcinogenesis. Our results therefore reveal a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of tumor cooperation by developmental organizers, which are induced fortuitously by oncogenic hits. "
negative,"Identification of ion channel genes in the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome. Aphids are major pests of crops, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage annually. Ion channel proteins are often the targets of modern insecticides and mutations in ion channel genes can lead to resistance to many leading classes of insecticides. The sequencing of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, genome has now allowed detailed in silico analysis of the aphid ion channels. The study has revealed significant differences in the composition of the ion channel families between the aphid and other insects. For example A. pisum does not appear to contain a homologue of the nACh receptor alpha 5 gene whilst the calcium channel beta subunit has been duplicated. These variations could result in differences in function or sensitivity to insecticides. The genome sequence will allow the study of aphid ion channels to be accelerated, leading to a better understanding of the function of these economically important channels. The potential for identifying novel insecticide targets within the aphid is now a step closer. "
positive,"Comparative analysis of C-type lectin domain proteins in the ghost moth, Thitarodes xiaojinensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae). Insects have a large family of C-type lectins involved in cell adhesion, pathogen recognition and activation of immune responses. In this study, 32 transcripts encoding C-type lectin domain proteins (CTLDPs) were identified from the Thitarodes xiaojinensis transcriptome. According to their domain structures, six CTLDPs with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) were classified into the CTL-S subfamily. The other 23 CTLDPs with two CRDs were grouped into the immulectin (IML) subfamily. The remaining three with extra regulatory domains were sorted into the CTL-X subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CTL-S and CTL-X members from different insects could form orthologous groups. In contrast, no T. xiaojinensis IML orthologues were found in other insects. Remarkable lineage-specific expansion in this subfamily was observed reflecting that these CTLDPs, as important receptors, have evolved diversified members in response to a variety of microbes. Prediction of binding ligands revealed that T. xiaojinensis, a cold-adapted species, conserved the ability of CRDs to combine with Ca2+ to keep its receptors from freezing. Comparative analysis of induction of CTLDP genes after different immune challenges indicated that IMLs might play critical roles in immune defenses. This study examined T. xiaojinensis CTLDPs and provides a basis for further studies of their characteristics. "
negative,"Transcriptomic study of the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus embryogenesis. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an invasive, concealed and destructive tissue borer, and it becomes a lethal pest of the palm family of plants and has been reported to attack 20 palm species around the globe. Here we report a systematic transcriptomic study on embryogenesis of RPW, where we analyze the transcriptomes across five developmental stages of RPW embryogenesis, involving four embryonic stages (E1, E2, E3 and E4) and one larval stage (L1). Using the RNA-seq and next-generation platforms, we generated 80 to 91 million reads for each library and assemble 22 532 genes that are expressed at different embryonic stages. Among the total transcripts from the five embryonic development stages, we found that 30.45 % are differentially expressed, 10.10 % show stage-specificity and even a larger fraction, 62.88 %, exhibit constitutive expression in all the stages. We also analyzes the expression dynamics of several conserved signaling pathways (such as Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, Notch, TGF-β, Ras / MAPK and Wnt), as well as key developmental genes, including those related to apoptosis, axis formation, Hox complex, neurogenesis and segmentation. The datasets provide an essential resource for gene annotation and RPW functional genomics, including studies by using tools and concepts from multiple disciplines, such as development, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics.  "
negative,"A genome-wide survey of small interfering RNA and microRNA pathway genes in a galling insect. Deployment of resistance (R) genes is the most effective control for Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say); however, deployment of R genes results in an increased frequency of pest genotypes that display virulence to them. RNA interference (RNAi) is a useful reverse genetics tool for studying such insect virulence pathways, but requires a systemic phenotype, which is not found in all species. In an effort to correlate our observed weak RNAi phenotype in M. destructor with a genetic basis, we have aggregated and compared RNAi related genes across M. destructor, three other insect species, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here the annotation of the core genes in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways in M. destructor. While most of the miRNA pathway genes were highly conserved across the species studied, the siRNA pathway genes showed increased relative variability in comparison to the miRNA pathway. In particular, the Piwi / Argonaute / Zwille (PAZ) domain of Dicer-2 (DCR-2) had the least amount of sequence similarity of any domain among species surveyed, with a trend of increased conservation in those species with amenable systemic RNAi. A homolog of the systemic interference defective-1 (Sid-1) gene of C. elegans was also not annotated in the M. destructor genome. Indeed, it is of interest that a Sid-1 homolog has not been detected in any dipteran species to date. We hypothesize the sequence architecture of the PAZ domain in the M. destructor DCR-2 protein is related to reduced efficacy of this enzyme and this taken together with the lack of a Sid-1 homolog may account for the weak RNAi response observed to date in this species as well as other dipteran species. "
negative,"BmiGI: a database of cDNAs expressed in Boophilus microplus, the tropical / southern cattle tick. We used an expressed sequence tag approach to initiate a study of the genome of the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. A normalized cDNA library was synthesized from pooled RNA purified from tick larvae which had been subjected to different treatments, including acaricide exposure, heat shock, cold shock, host odor, and infection with Babesia bovis. For the acaricide exposure experiments, we used several strains of ticks, which varied in their levels of susceptibility to pyrethroid, organophosphate and amitraz. We also included RNA purified from samples of eggs, nymphs and adult ticks and dissected tick organs. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 11,520 cDNA clones and both 5' and 3' sequencing performed on each clone. The sequence data was used to search public protein databases and a B. microplus gene index was constructed, consisting of 8270 unique sequences whose associated putative functional assignments, when available, can be viewed at the TIGR website (http: /  / www.tigr.org / tdb / tgi). A number of novel sequences were identified which possessed significant sequence similarity to genes, which might be involved in resistance to acaricides. "
positive,"Egf-like gene is essential for cuticle metabolism in the brown planthopper. Using the mass spectrometry analysis of cuticle casts of brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and transcriptome analysis of BPH tissues, we identified a gigantic gene (50,922 bp, 16,973 aa) tentatively called Nlegf-like. Multiple transcripts were found. Nlegf-like encodes an integral membrane protein of 16,973 amino acid residues with 260 EGF-like repeats and 16 Ca2+-binding EGF repeats type (cbEGFs) in the extracellular portion. Nlegf-like was highly expressed in the integument and tended to peak at the middle stage or late stage of each nymph instar. Phylogenetic analysis showed this gene is conserved in many other insects. Different double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting eight different regions of the Nlegf-like gene resulted in abnormal cuticle formation or molting and lethal phenotypes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the newly formed endocuticle was significantly thinner for RNAi-treated BPHs with phenotype of contracted abdomen, or the old cuticle could not be digested sufficiently for those with phenotype of slender body shape or died with molting difficulty when compared with the control group. We suggest that the Nlegf-like is crucial for metabolism of the cuticle in BPH molting. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was determined as a circular molecular of 15,273 bp in size. The mitogenome composition (37 genes) and gene order are the same as the other lepidopterans. Nucleotide composition of the C. cephalonica mitogenome is highly A+T biased (80.43%) like other insects. Twelve protein-coding genes start with a typical ATN codon, with the exception of coxl gene, which uses CGA as the initial codon. Nine protein-coding genes have the common stop codon TAA, and the nad2, cox1, cox2, and nad4 have single T as the incomplete stop codon. 22 tRNA genes demonstrated cloverleaf secondary structure. The mitogenome has several large intergenic spacer regions, the spacer1 between trnQ gene and nad2 gene, which is common in Lepidoptera. The spacer 3 between trnE and trnF includes microsatellite-like repeat regions (AT)18 and (TTAT)(3). The spacer 4 (16 bp) between trnS2 gene and nad1 gene has a motif ATACTAT; another species, Sesamia inferens encodes ATCATAT at the same position, while other lepidopteran insects encode a similar ATACTAA motif. The spacer 6 is A+T rich region, include motif ATAGA and a 20-bp poly(T) stretch and two microsatellite (AT)(9), (AT)(8) elements. "
negative,"Genomic analysis of ""Elusimicrobium minutum,"" the first cultivated representative of the phylum ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly termite group 1). Organisms of the candidate phylum termite group 1 (TG1) are regularly encountered in termite hindguts but are present also in many other habitats. Here, we report the complete genome sequence (1.64 Mbp) of ""Elusimicrobium minutum"" strain Pei191(T), the first cultured representative of the TG1 phylum. We reconstructed the metabolism of this strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from a beetle larva gut, and we discuss the findings in light of physiological data. E. minutum has all genes required for uptake and fermentation of sugars via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, including several hydrogenases, and an unusual peptide degradation pathway comprising transamination reactions and leading to the formation of alanine, which is excreted in substantial amounts. The presence of genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the presence of a pathway for peptidoglycan formation are consistent with ultrastructural evidence of a gram-negative cell envelope. Even though electron micrographs showed no cell appendages, the genome encodes many genes putatively involved in pilus assembly. We assigned some to a type II secretion system, but the function of 60 pilE-like genes remains unknown. Numerous genes with hypothetical functions, e.g., polyketide synthesis, nonribosomal peptide synthesis, antibiotic transport, and oxygen stress protection, indicate the presence of hitherto undiscovered physiological traits. Comparative analysis of 22 concatenated single-copy marker genes corroborated the status of ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly TG1) as a separate phylum in the bacterial domain, which was so far based only on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. "
negative,"Functional consequences of mutations in the Drosophila histamine receptor HCLB. The gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in hclB lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of hclB in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two D. melanogaster mutants, hclB(T1) (P293S) and hclB(T2) (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41 degrees C, the hclB(T2) flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the hclB(T1) flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in hclB(T1) after anaesthesia with halothane. Enhanced synaptic signalling at low-intensity light stimuli was registered on electroretinograms recorded from the two mutant strains. Our results suggest that HCLB may play an essential and conserved role in insect neurophysiology. "
negative,"Applications of genome editing in insects. Insect genome editing was first reported 1991 in Drosophila melanogaster but the technology used was not portable to other species. Not until the recent development of facile, engineered DNA endonuclease systems has gene editing become widely available to insect scientists. Most applications in insects to date have been technical in nature but this is rapidly changing. Functional genomics and genetics-based insect control efforts will be major beneficiaries of the application of contemporary gene editing technologies. Engineered endonucleases like Cas9 make it possible to create powerful and effective gene drive systems that could be used to reduce or even eradicate specific insect populations. 'Best practices' for using Cas9-based editing are beginning to emerge making it easier and more effective to design and use but gene editing technologies still require traditional means of delivery in order to introduce them into somatic and germ cells of insects-microinjection of developing embryos. This constrains the use of these technologies by insect scientists. Insects created using editing technologies challenge existing governmental regulatory structures designed to manage genetically modified organisms. "
negative,"Comparative analysis of serine protease-related genes in the honey bee genome: possible involvement in embryonic development and innate immunity. We have identified 44 serine protease (SP) and 13 serine protease homolog (SPH) genes in the genome of Apis mellifera. Most of these genes encode putative secreted proteins, but four SPs and three SPHs may associate with the plasma membrane via a transmembrane region. Clip domains represent the most abundant non-catalytic structural units in these SP-like proteins -12 SPs and six SPHs contain at least one clip domain. Some of the family members contain other modules for protein-protein interactions, including disulphide-stabilized structures (LDL(r)A, SRCR, frizzled, kringle, Sushi, Wonton and Pan / apple), carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type lectin and chitin-binding), and other modules (such as zinc finger, CUB, coiled coil and Sina). Comparison of the sequences with those from Drosophila led to a proposed SP pathway for establishing the dorsoventral axis of honey bee embryos. Multiple sequence alignments revealed evolutionary relationships of honey bee SPs and SPHs with those in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Manduca sexta. We identified homologs of D. melanogaster persephone, M. sexta HP14, PAP-1 and SPH-1. A. mellifera genome includes at least five genes for potential SP inhibitors (serpin-1 through -5) and three genes of SP putative substrates (prophenoloxidase, spätzle-1 and spätzle-2). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed an elevation in the mRNA levels of SP2, SP3, SP9, SP10, SPH41, SPH42, SP49, serpin-2, serpin-4, serpin-5, and spätzle-2 in adults after a microbial challenge. The SP41 and SP6 transcripts significantly increased after an injection of Paenibacillus larva, but there was no such increase after injection of saline or Escherichia coli. mRNA levels of most SPs and serpins significantly increased by 48 h after the pathogen infection in 1st instar larvae. On the contrary, SP1, SP3, SP19 and serpin-5 transcript levels reduced. These results, taken together, provide a framework for designing experimental studies of the roles of SPs and related proteins in embryonic development and immune responses of A. mellifera. "
negative,"Whole transcriptome responses among females of the filariasis and arbovirus vector mosquito Culex pipiens implicate TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification as key drivers of diapause induction. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are important disease vectors inhabiting temperate zones, worldwide. The seasonal reduction in temperature and photoperiod accompanying late summer and early fall prompts female mosquitoes to enter diapause, a stage of developmental arrest and physiological conditioning that enhances survival during the winter months. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying diapause induction, we used custom whole transcriptome microarrays to identify differences in gene expression following exposure to nondiapause (long days, 25 °C) and diapause-inducing (short days, 18 °C) environmental conditions. Using a two-way ANOVA, we identified 1130 genes that were differentially expressed. We used the expression of these genes across three time points to construct a gene co-expression network comprising five modules. Genes in modules 1, 2, and 3 were largely up-regulated, while genes in modules 4 and 5 were down-regulated when compared to nondiapause conditions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the network modules revealed some potential regulatory mechanisms driving diapause induction. Module 1 was enriched for genes in the TGF-ß and Wnt signaling pathways; module 2 was enriched for genes involved in insect hormone biosynthesis, specifically, ecdysone synthesis; module 3 was enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification; and module 5 was enriched for genes in the circadian rhythm pathway. Our results suggest that TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification are key drivers for the integration of environmental signals into the diapause induction phase in C. pipiens mosquitoes. "
negative,"Complete DNA sequence of Kuraishia capsulata illustrates novel genomic features among budding yeasts (Saccharomycotina). The numerous yeast genome sequences presently available provide a rich source of information for functional as well as evolutionary genomics but unequally cover the large phylogenetic diversity of extant yeasts. We present here the complete sequence of the nuclear genome of the haploid-type strain of Kuraishia capsulata (CBS1993(T)), a nitrate-assimilating Saccharomycetales of uncertain taxonomy, isolated from tunnels of insect larvae underneath coniferous barks and characterized by its copious production of extracellular polysaccharides. The sequence is composed of seven scaffolds, one per chromosome, totaling 11.4 Mb and containing 6,029 protein-coding genes, ~13.5% of which being interrupted by introns. This GC-rich yeast genome (45.7%) appears phylogenetically related with the few other nitrate-assimilating yeasts sequenced so far, Ogataea polymorpha, O. parapolymorpha, and Dekkera bruxellensis, with which it shares a very reduced number of tRNA genes, a novel tRNA sparing strategy, and a common nitrate assimilation cluster, three specific features to this group of yeasts. Centromeres were recognized in GC-poor troughs of each scaffold. The strain bears MAT alpha genes at a single MAT locus and presents a significant degree of conservation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, suggesting that it can perform sexual cycles in nature, although genes involved in meiosis were not all recognized. The complete absence of conservation of synteny between K. capsulata and any other yeast genome described so far, including the three other nitrate-assimilating species, validates the interest of this species for long-range evolutionary genomic studies among Saccharomycotina yeasts. "
negative,"Gene expression changes governing extreme dehydration tolerance in an Antarctic insect. Among terrestrial organisms, arthropods are especially susceptible to dehydration, given their small body size and high surface area to volume ratio. This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable for much of the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to quantify transcriptional mechanisms of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world's southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70% of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and ATP production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct transcriptional mechanisms to cope with similar desiccating conditions. "
positive,"Structure and evolution of the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE) gene from the firefly Photinus pyralis. To study the structural features of genes for the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE), the entire gene along with 524 bp of upstream sequence was determined from Photinus pyralis (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). The LRE gene revealed an open reading frame composed of five exons divided by four introns ranging in size from 47 to 904 bp. The deduced LRE amino acid sequence showed identity to senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) from a number of insects and mammals including four putative SMP30 sequences from Anopheles gambiae. Gene structure comparisons showed some intron / exon site conservation with A. gambiae and mammalian SMP30 proteins but not Drosophila. LRE and luciferase sequence comparisons revealed two conserved putative luciferin-binding sites. The evolution of LRE was discussed in relation to its function. "
positive,"Translational and transcriptional control elements in the untranslated leader of the heat-shock gene hsp22. Downstream of the transcription start site in the Drosophila heat-shock gene hsp22, we have identified a region that is necessary for efficient transcription, and also for selective translation during heat shock. We assayed the expression of mutated genes after P-factor-mediated insertion into the genome. Deletions within the first 26 nucleotides block the preferential translation of hsp22 mRNA at high temperature. The rate of transcription is also decreased, though transcription is still heat-inducible. Leaving this region intact, up to 86% of the leader can be deleted without affecting translation or transcription. The functional region coincides with a region of sequence homology between the heat-shock genes. Only partial homology is found to a conserved sequence, ATCAGTTCT, found at the very 5' end of other insect genes. "
positive,"Hunchback knockdown induces supernumerary segment formation in Bombyx. Insect segment number within species appears to be fixed irrespective of germ types: long vs. short / intermediate. The present study showed induction of supernumerary segment formation by the knockdown of Bombyx hunchback (Bm-hb), presumably by terminal segment addition, a short / intermediate-like-segmentation mode that is not observed in normal Bombyx embryogenesis. This suggests that Bm-hb suppresses segmentation. The results obtained also suggest that the gap gene Bm-Kr (Bombyx Krüppel) provides a permissive environment for the progression of segmentation by suppressing the expression Bm-hb, which terminates segmentation. This indicates a novel mechanism by which the gap gene is involved in segmentation. It appears that Bm-Kr and Bm-hb are involved in segment counting and their interplay contributes to the correct number of segments being formed in Bombyx. Similar mechanisms may be operating in insects that employ the non-Drosophilan mode of segmentation such as in short / intermediate-germ insects. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73. Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive bacterium that produces intracellular protein crystals toxic to a wide variety of insect larvae. We report the complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73 from the Centre OILB (Institut Pasteur, France), which belongs to serotype 3ab and is toxic to lepidopteran larvae. "
negative,"Reovirus genomes from plant-feeding insects represent a newly discovered lineage within the family Reoviridae. A complex set of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) was isolated from threecornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus), a plant-feeding hemipteran pest. A subset of these dsRNAs constitute the genome of a new reovirus, provisionally designated Spissistilus festinus reovirus (SpFRV). SpFRV was present in threecornered alfalfa hopper populations in the San Joaquin Valley of California, with incidence ranging from 10% to 60% in 24 of 25 sample sets analyzed. The 10 dsRNA segments of SpFRV were completely sequenced and shown to share conserved terminal sequences (5'-AGAGA and CGAUGUUGU-3') of the positive-sense strand that are distinct from known species of the family Reoviridae. Comparisons of the RNA directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) indicated SpFRV is most closely related (39.1% amino acid identity) to another new reovirus infecting the angulate leafhopper (Acinopterus angulatus) and provisionally designated Acinopterus angulatus reovirus (AcARV). The RdRp of both viruses was distantly related to Raspberry latent virus RdRp at 27.0% (SpFRV) and 30.0% (AcARV) or Rice ragged stunt virus RdRp at 26.2% (SpFRV) and 29.0% (AcARV) amino acid identity. RdRp phylogeny confirmed that SpFRV and AcARV are sister taxa sharing a most recent common ancestor. SpFRV segment 6 encodes a protein containing two NTP binding motifs that are conserved in homologs of reoviruses in the subfamily Spinareovirinae. The protein encoded by SpFRV segment 4 was identified as a guanylyltransferase homolog. SpFRV segments 1, 3, and 10 encode homologs of reovirus structural proteins. No homologs were identified for proteins encoded by SpFRV segments 5, 7, 8, and 9. Collectively, the low level of sequence identity with other reoviruses, similar segment terminal sequences, RdRp phylogeny, and host taxa indicate that SpFRV and AcARV may be considered members of a proposed new genus of the family Reoviridae (subfamily Spinareovirinae), with SpFRV assigned as the type species.

positive,"Molecular characterization of glutamate-gated chloride channel and its possible roles in development and abamectin susceptibility in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in invertebrate nervous systems, and are of considerable interest in insecticide discovery. The full length cDNA encoding CsGluCl was cloned from the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker). Multiple cDNA sequence alignment revealed three variants of CsGluCl generated by alternative splicing of exon 3 and exon 9. While all the transcripts were predominantly expressed in both nerve cord and brain, the expression patterns of these three variants differed among other tissues and developmental stages. Specifically, the expression level of CsGluCl C in cuticle was similar to that in nerve cord and brain, and was the predominant variant in late pupae and early adult stages. Both injection and oral delivery of dsGluCl significantly reduced the mRNA level of CsGluCl. Increased susceptibility to abamectin and reduced larvae growth and pupation rate were observed in dsGluCl-treated larvae. Thus, our results provide the evidence that in addition to act as the target of abamectin, GluCls also play important physiological roles in the development of insects. "
negative,"Functional Immunomics of the Squash Bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer) (Heteroptera: Coreidae). The Squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a major piercing / sucking pest of cucurbits, causing extensive damage to plants and fruits, and transmitting phytopathogens. No genomic resources to facilitate field and laboratory studies of this pest were available; therefore the first de novo exome for this destructive pest was assembled. RNA was extracted from insects challenged with bacterial and fungal immunoelicitors, insects fed on different cucurbit species, and insects from all life stages from egg to adult. All treatments and replicates were separately barcoded for subsequent analyses, then pooled for sequencing in a single lane using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Over 211 million 100-base tags generated in this manner were trimmed, filtered, and cleaned, then assembled into a de novo reference transcriptome using the Broad Institute Trinity assembly algorithm. The assembly was annotated using NCBIx NR, BLAST2GO, KEGG and other databases. Of the >130,000 total assemblies 37,327 were annotated identifying the sequences of candidate gene silencing targets from immune, endocrine, reproductive, cuticle, and other physiological systems. Expression profiling of the adult immune response was accomplished by aligning the 100-base tags from each biological replicate from each treatment and controls to the annotated reference assembly of the A. tristis transcriptome.

negative,"Genome sequence of Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420T, a symbiotic bacterium from entomopathogenic nematode. Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) (=CGMCC 1.6853(T), DZ0503SBS1(T)), isolated from the intestine of Heterorhabditidoides chongmingensis, has been known to have symbiotic-pathogenic life cycle, on the multilateral relationships with entomopathogenic nematode and insect pest. In order to better understanding of this rare feature in Serratia species, we present here the genome sequence of S. nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) with the significance of first genome sequence in this species.  "
negative,"Large diversity of the piggyBac-like elements in the genome of Tribolium castaneum. The piggyBac transposable element (TE), originally discovered in the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, has been widely used in insect transgenesis including the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We surveyed piggyBac-like (PLE) sequences in the genome of T. castaneum by homology searches using as queries the diverse PLE sequences that have been described previously. The search yielded a total of 32 piggyBac-like elements (TcPLEs) which were classified into 14 distinct groups. Most of the TcPLEs contain defective functional motifs in that they are lacking inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) or have disrupted open reading frames. Only one single copy of TcPLE1 appears to be intact with imperfect 16bp ITRs flanking an open reading frame encoding a transposase of 571 amino acid residues. Many copies of TcPLEs were found to be inserted into or close to other transposon-like sequences. This large diversity of TcPLEs with generally low copy numbers suggests multiple invasions of the TcPLEs over a long evolutionary time without extensive multiplications or occurrence of rapid loss of TcPLEs copies. "
positive,"RNAi of ace1 and ace2 in Blattella germanica reveals their differential contribution to acetylcholinesterase activity and sensitivity to insecticides. Cyclorrhapha insect genomes contain a single acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene while other insects contain at least two ace genes (ace1 and ace2). In this study we tested the hypothesis that the two ace paralogous from Blattella germanica have different contributions to AChE activity, using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown each one individually. Paralogous-specific depletion of Bgace transcripts was evident in ganglia of injected cockroaches, although the effects at the protein level were less pronounced. Using spectrophotometric and zymogram measurements, we obtained evidence that BgAChE1 represents 65-75% of the total AChE activity in nerve tissue demonstrating that ace1 encodes a predominant AChE. A significant increase in sensitivity of Bgace1-interfered cockroaches was observed after 48 h of exposure to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, Bgace2 knockdown had a negligible effect on mortality to this organophosphate. These results point out a key role, qualitative and / or quantitative, of AChE1 as target of organophosphate insecticides in this species. Silencing the expression of Bgace1 but not Bgace2 also produced an increased mortality in insects when synergized with lambda-cyhalothrin, a situation which resembles the synergistic effects observed between organophosphates and pyrethroids. Gene silencing of ace genes by RNAi offers an exciting approach for examining a possible functional differentiation in ace paralogous. "
negative,The promise of insect genomics. Insects are the largest animal group in the world and are ecologically and economically extremely important. This importance of insects is reflected by the existence of currently 24 insect genome projects. Our perspective discusses the state-of-the-art of these genome projects and the impacts that they have on basic insect science and pest control. 
negative,"Delivery of dsRNA for RNAi in insects: an overview and future directions. RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the process of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing the complementary endogenous messenger RNA. RNAi has been widely used in entomological research for functional genomics in a variety of insects and its potential for RNAi-based pest control has been increasingly emphasized mainly because of its high specificity. This review focuses on the approaches of introducing dsRNA into insect cells or insect bodies to induce effective RNAi. The three most common delivery methods, namely, microinjection, ingestion, and soaking, are illustrated in details and their advantages and limitations are summarized for purpose of feasible RNAi research. In this review, we also briefly introduce the two possible dsRNA uptake machineries, other dsRNA delivery methods and the history of RNAi in entomology. Factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of RNAi such as transfection reagents, selection of dsRNA region, length, and stability of dsRNA in RNAi research are discussed for further studies. "
negative,"Genome-wide association study of insect bite hypersensitivity in two horse populations in the Netherlands. BACKGROUND: Insect bite hypersensitivity is a common allergic disease in horse populations worldwide. Insect bite hypersensitivity is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. However, little is known about genes contributing to the genetic variance associated with insect bite hypersensitivity. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify and quantify genomic associations with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses in the Netherlands. METHODS: Data on 200 Shetland pony mares and 146 Icelandic horses were collected according to a matched case-control design. Cases and controls were matched on various factors (e.g. region, sire) to minimize effects of population stratification. Breed-specific genome-wide association studies were performed using 70 k single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes. Bayesian variable selection method Bayes-C with a threshold model implemented in GenSel software was applied. A 1 Mb non-overlapping window approach that accumulated contributions of adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to identify associated genomic regions. RESULTS: The percentage of variance explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms was 13% in Shetland pony mares and 28% in Icelandic horses. The 20 non-overlapping windows explaining the largest percentages of genetic variance were found on nine chromosomes in Shetland pony mares and on 14 chromosomes in Icelandic horses. Overlap in identified associated genomic regions between breeds would suggest interesting candidate regions to follow-up on. Such regions common to both breeds (within 15 Mb) were found on chromosomes 3, 7, 11, 20 and 23. Positional candidate genes within 2 Mb from the associated windows were identified on chromosome 20 in both breeds. Candidate genes are within the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region, which evokes an immune response by recognizing many foreign molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The genome-wide association study identified several genomic regions associated with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses. On chromosome 20, associated genomic regions in both breeds were within 2 Mb from the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region. Increased knowledge on insect bite hypersensitivity associated genes will contribute to our understanding of its biology, enabling more efficient selection, therapy and prevention to decrease insect bite hypersensitivity prevalence. "
negative,"Knockdown of midgut genes by dsRNA-transgenic plant-mediated RNA interference in the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technique for functional genomics research in insects. Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been reported for lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, showing potential for field-level control of insect pests, but this has not been reported for other insect orders. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Hemipteran insect brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a typical phloem sap feeder specific to rice (Oryza sativa L.). To analyze the potential of exploiting RNAi-mediated effects in this insect, we identified genes (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) encoding proteins that might be involved in the RNAi pathway in N. lugens. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously in nymphs and adult insects. Three genes (the hexose transporter gene NlHT1, the carboxypeptidase gene Nlcar and the trypsin-like serine protease gene Nltry) that are highly expressed in the N. lugens midgut were isolated and used to develop dsRNA constructs for transforming rice. RNA blot analysis showed that the dsRNAs were transcribed and some of them were processed to siRNAs in the transgenic lines. When nymphs were fed on rice plants expressing dsRNA, levels of transcripts of the targeted genes in the midgut were reduced; however, lethal phenotypic effects after dsRNA feeding were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that genes for the RNAi pathway (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) are present in N. lugens. When insects were fed on rice plant materials expressing dsRNAs, RNA interference was triggered and the target genes transcript levels were suppressed. The gene knockdown technique described here may prove to be a valuable tool for further investigations in N. lugens. The results demonstrate the potential of dsRNA-mediated RNAi for field-level control of planthoppers, but appropriate target genes must be selected when designing the dsRNA-transgenic plants. "
negative,"Metabolic pools differ among ecologically diverse Drosophila species. Studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying metabolic storage have focused on a few model organisms. Although very fruitful, these studies have not allowed for the examination of mechanisms across a phylogenetic spectrum. The exploration of natural patterns of metabolic pool size variation across species will help us to better understand the genetics of metabolic adaptation. We examined the metabolic pools size (triglyceride, glycogen and protein) at two ages in 12 Drosophila species with distinctly different ecologies for which complete genome sequences (for 11 of the 12 species) are known. Overall, there were significant differences across species for all three pools, while age and sex appear to affect some metabolic pools more than others. After correcting for the phylogenetic relatedness of the species used, we observed no association between triglyceride and glycogen content. Although within species these two pools sometimes are correlated, at a larger phylogenetic scale control of triglyceride and glycogen contents may have been shaped independently by natural selection. "
negative,"RNA interference in the termite Reticulitermes flavipes through ingestion of double-stranded RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) represents a breakthrough technology for conducting functional genomics research in non-model organisms and for the highly targeted control of insect pests. This study investigated RNAi via voluntary feeding in the economically important pest termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We used a high-dose double-stranded (ds) RNA feeding approach to silence two termite genes: one encoding an endogenous digestive cellulase enzyme and the other a caste-regulatory hexamerin storage protein. Contrary to results from previous low-dose studies that examined injection-based RNAi, high-dose silencing of either gene through dsRNA feeding led to significantly reduced group fitness and mortality. Hexamerin silencing in combination with ectopic juvenile hormone treatments additionally led to lethal molting impacts and increased differentiation of presoldier caste phenotypes (a phenotype that is not capable of feeding). These results provide the first examples of insecticidal effects from dsRNA feeding in a termite. Additionally, these results validate a high-throughput bioassay approach for use in (i) termite functional genomics research, and (ii) characterizing target sites of conventional and novel RNAi-based termiticides. "
negative,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and comparative analysis with five additional insects. Glutathione S-transferases are important detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide resistance. Sequencing the Tribolium castaneum genome provides an opportunity to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of GSTs on a genome-wide scale. Thirty-six putative cytosolic GSTs and 5 microsomal GSTs have been identified in T. castaneum. Furthermore, 40, 35, 13, 23, and 32 GSTs have been discovered the other insects, Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Acyrthosiphon, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that insect-specific GSTs, Epsilon and Delta, are the largest species-specific expanded GSTs. In T. castaneum, most GSTs are tandemly arranged in three chromosomes. Particularly, Epsilon GSTs have an inverted long-fragment duplication in the genome. Other four widely distributed classes are highly conserved in all species. Given that GSTs specially expanded in Tribolium castaneum, these genes might help to resist poisonous chemical environments and produce resistance to kinds of different insecticides. "
positive,"Cloning of a putative Bombyx mori TFIIB-related factor (BRF). To identify the protein domains responsible for its conserved and specialized functions, putative TFIIB-Related Factor (BRF) from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) was compared with BRFs from other organisms. The Bombyx BRF coding region was assembled from three separate and overlapping cDNA fragments. Fragments encoding the middle portion and the 3' end were discovered in the Bombyx mori Genome Project ""Silkbase"" collection through sequence homology with human BRF1, and the fragment encoding the N-terminus was isolated in our laboratory using the 5' RACE method. Southern analysis showed that silkworm BRF is encoded by a single-copy gene. Bombyx BRF contains the following domains that have been noted in all other BRFs, and that are likely, therefore, to provide highly conserved functions: a zinc finger domain, an imperfect repeat, three ""BRF Homology"" domains, and an acidic domain at the C-terminus. As expected from the evolutionary relationships among insects and mammals, Bombyx BRF is more similar overall to Drosophila BRF (55% identical) than to human BRF1 (42% identical). Detailed examination of individual domains reveals a remarkable exception, however. Domain II of Bombyx BRF is more similar to its human counterpart than to Drosophila Domain II. This result indicates that Domain II has undergone unusual divergence in Drosophila, and suggests a structural basis for Drosophila BRF's unique pattern of interaction with other transcription factors. "
positive,"Domain structure and expression along the midgut and carcass of peritrophins and cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins in insects with and without peritrophic membrane. Most insects have a peritrophic membrane (matrix) (PM) surrounding the food bolus. This structure, similarly to the cuticle, is mainly composed of chitin and proteins. The main proteins forming PM are known as peritrophins (PMP), whereas some of the cuticle proteins are the cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins (CPAP). Both proteins are composed of one or more chitin binding peritrophin-A domain (CBD) and no other recognized domain. Furthermore, insects containing PM usually have two chitin synthase (CS) genes, one mainly expressed in carcass and the other in midgut. In this work we identified PMP, CPAP and CS genes in the genome of insects from the Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera and Holometabola cohorts and analyzed their expression profile in different species from each group. In agreement with the absence of PM, we observed less CBD-containing proteins and only one CS gene in the genome of Paraneoptera species, except for the Phthiraptera Pediculus humanus. The lack of PM in Paraneoptera species was also confirmed by the micrographs of the midgut of two Hemiptera species, Dysdercus peruvianus and Mahanarva fimbriolata which agreed with the RNA-seq data of both species. Our analyses also highlighted a higher number of CBD-containing proteins in Holometabola in relation to the earlier divergent Polyneoptera group, especially regarding the genes composed of more than three CBDs, which are usually associated to PM formation. Finally, we observed a high number of CBD-containing proteins being expressed in both midgut and carcass tissues of several species, which we named as ubiquitous-CBD-containing proteins (UCBP), as their function is unclear. We hypothesized that these proteins can be involved in both cuticle and PM formation or that they can be involved in immune response and / or tracheolae formation. "
positive,"Multiple functions of CREB-binding protein during postembryonic development: identification of target genes. BACKGROUND: Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect. RESULTS: CBP is ubiquitously expressed in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of CBP resulted in a decrease in JH induction of Kr-h1 gene expression in Tribolium larvae and led to a block in their development. Moreover, the injection of CBP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed lethal phenotypes within 8 days of injection. RNA-seq and subsequent differential gene expression analysis identified CBP target genes in Tribolium. Knockdown of CBP caused a decrease in the expression of 1306 genes coding for transcription factors and other proteins associated with growth and development. Depletion of CBP impaired the expression of several JH response genes (e.g., Kr-h1, Hairy, early trypsin) and ecdysone response genes (EcR, E74, E75, and broad complex). Further, GO enrichment analyses of the downregulated genes showed enrichment in different functions including developmental processes, pigmentation, anatomical structure development, regulation of biological and cellular processes, etc. CONCLUSION: These data suggest diverse but crucial roles for CBP during postembryonic development in the coleopteran model insect, Tribolium. It can serve as a target for RNAi mediated pest management of this stored product pest. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of phenobarbital-inducible genes in Drosophila melanogaster. An oligoarray analysis was conducted to determine the differential expression of genes due to phenobarbital exposure in Drosophila melanogaster (w(1118) strain) third instar larvae. Seventeen genes were observed to be induced with increased expression by a statistical analysis of microarrays approach with a q < or = 0.05. At q < or = 0.12, four more genes (Cyp12d1, DmGstd4, and two genes with unknown function) were found to be up-regulated, and 11 genes with unknown function were found to be down-regulated. Fifteen of these genes, Cyp4d14, Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp12d1, Cyp6d5, Cyp6w1, CG2065, DmGstd6, DmGstd7, Amy-p / Amy-d, Ugt86Dd, GC5724, Jheh1, Jheh2 and CG11893, were verified using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Some of these genes have been shown to be over-transcribed in metabolically DDT-resistant Drosophila strains. "
negative,"Phylogeny and evolution of the cholesterol transporter NPC1 in insects. Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b. "
negative,"Extensive genetic diversity among populations of the malaria mosquito Anopheles moucheti revealed by population genomics. Malaria vectors are exposed to intense selective pressures due to large-scale intervention programs that are underway in most African countries. One of the current priorities is therefore to clearly assess the adaptive potential of Anopheline populations, which is critical to understand and anticipate the response mosquitoes can elicit against such adaptive challenges. The development of genomic resources that will empower robust examinations of evolutionary changes in all vectors including currently understudied species is an inevitable step toward this goal. Here we constructed double-digest Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries and generated 6461 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that we used to explore the population structure and demographic history of wild-caught Anopheles moucheti from Cameroon. The genome-wide distribution of allelic frequencies among samples best fitted that of an old population at equilibrium, characterized by a weak genetic structure and extensive genetic diversity, presumably due to a large long term effective population size. Estimates of FST and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs reveal a very low genetic differentiation throughout the genome and the absence of segregating LD blocks among populations, suggesting an overall lack of local adaptation. Our study provides the first investigation of the genetic structure and diversity in An. moucheti at the genomic scale. We conclude that, despite a weak genetic structure, this species has the potential to challenge current vector control measures and other rapid anthropogenic and environmental changes thanks to its great genetic diversity. "
negative,"Discovery, adaptation and transcriptional activity of two tick promoters: Construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for optimization of RNA interference in rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus cell lines. Dual luciferase reporter systems are valuable tools for functional genomic studies, but have not previously been developed for use in tick cell culture. We evaluated expression of available luciferase constructs in tick cell cultures derived from Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, an important vector of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Commercial promoters were evaluated for transcriptional activity driving luciferase expression in the tick cell lines. The human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter resulted in detectable firefly luciferase activity within 2 days post-transfection of the R. microplus cell line BME26, with maximal activity at 5 days post-transfection. Several other promoters were weaker or inactive in the tick cells, prompting identification and assessment of transcriptional activity of the homologous ribosomal protein L4 (rpL4, GenBank accession no.: KM516205) and elongation factor 1α (EF-1α, GenBank accession no.: KM516204) promoters cloned from R. microplus. Evaluation of luciferase expression driven by various promoters in tick cell culture resulted in selection of the R. microplus rpL4 promoter and the human PGK promoter driving transcription of sequences encoding modified firefly and NanoLuc® luciferases for construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for use in tick cell culture.  "
negative,"Engineering the genomes of wild insect populations: challenges, and opportunities provided by synthetic Medea selfish genetic elements. Advances in insect transgenesis and our knowledge of insect physiology and genomics are making it possible to create transgenic populations of beneficial or pest insects that express novel traits. There are contexts in which we may want the transgenes responsible for these traits to spread so that all individuals within a wild population carry them, a process known as population replacement. Transgenes of interest are unlikely to confer an overall fitness benefit on those who carry them. Therefore, an essential component of any population replacement strategy is the presence of a drive mechanism that will ensure the spread of linked transgenes. We discuss contexts in which population replacement might be desirable and the requirements a drive system must satisfy to be both effective and safe. We then describe the creation of synthetic Medea elements, the first selfish genetic elements synthesized de novo, with the capability of driving population replacement, in this case in Drosophila. The strategy used to create Drosophila Medea is applicable to a number of other insect species and the Medea system satisfies key requirements for scientific and social acceptance. Finally, we highlight several challenges to implementing population replacement in the wild. "
positive,"The limpet transcription factors of Triatoma infestans regulate the response to fungal infection and modulate the expression pattern of defensin genes. As part of the innate humoral response to microbial attack, insects activate the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this response in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans is important since biological control strategies against pyrethroid-resistant insect populations were recently addressed by using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. By bioinformatics, gene expression, and silencing techniques in T. infestans nymphs, we achieved sequence and functional characterization of two variants of the limpet transcription factor (Tilimpet) and studied their role as regulators of the AMP expression, particularly defensins, in fungus-infected insects. We found that Tilimpet variants may act differentially since they have divergent sequences and different relative expression ratios, suggesting that Tilimpet-2 could be the main regulator of the higher expressed defensins and Tilimpet-1 might play a complementary or more general role. Also, the six defensins (Tidef-1 to Tidef-6) exhibited different expression levels in fungus-infected nymphs, consistent with their phylogenetic clustering. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of T. infestans immune response in which limpet is involved, after challenge by B. bassiana infection. "
negative,"Genetic regions that interact with loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes of deltex implicate novel genes in Drosophila Notch signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates many cell fate decisions. The deltex (dx) gene encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that binds to the intracellular domain of the Notch protein and regulates Notch signaling in a positive manner. However, it is still not clear how Dx does this. We generated a transgenic line, GMR-dx, which overexpresses dx in the developing Drosophila eye disc. The GMR-dx line showed a rough-eye phenotype, specific transformation of a photoreceptor cell (R3 to R4), and a rotation defect in the ommatidia. This phenotype was suppressed in combination with a dx loss-of-function mutant, indicating that it was due to a dx gain-of-function. We previously reported that overexpression of Dx results in the stabilization of Notch in late endosomes. Here, we found that three motifs in Dx, a region that binds to Notch, a proline-rich motif and a RING-H2 finger, were required for this stabilization, although the relative activity of these variants in this assay did not always correspond to the severity of the rough-eye phenotype. In an attempt to identify novel genes of the Notch pathway, we tested a large collection of chromosomal deficiencies for the ability to modify the eye phenotypes of the GMR-dx line. Twelve genomic segments that enhanced the rough-eye phenotype of GMR-dx were identified. To evaluate the specificity of these interactions, we then determined whether the deletions also interacted with the wing phenotypes associated with a loss-of-function mutation of dx, dx24. Analyses based on whole-genome information allowed us to conclude that we have identified two novel loci that probably include uncharacterized genes involved in Dx-mediated Notch signaling. "
positive,"Genome-wide gene expression profiling reveals that cuticle alterations and P450 detoxification are associated with deltamethrin and DDT resistance in Anopheles arabiensis populations from Ethiopia. BACKGROUND: Vector control is the main intervention in malaria control and elimination strategies. However, the development of insecticide resistance is one of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although an L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations - Asendabo, Chewaka and Tolay - and two susceptible strains - Sekoru and Mozambique. RESULTS: Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4, were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance. Although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle, a higher cuticular hydrocarbon content was observed in a resistant population. CONCLUSION: Our transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance mechanisms and paves the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle composition in insecticide resistance of malaria vectors. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Dysfunction of LSD-1 induces JNK signaling pathway-dependent abnormal development of thorax and apoptosis cell death in Drosophila melanogaster. Perilipins are evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals. Lipid storage droplet-1 (LSD-1) is a member of the lipid droplet's surface-binding protein family and counterpart to mammalian perilipin 1. The role of LSD-1 has already been reported in lipid metabolism of Drosophila. However, the function of this gene during specific tissue development is still under investigation. Here, we found that LSD-1 is expressed in the notum of the wing imaginal disc, and notum-specific knockdown of Lsd-1 by pannir-GAL4 driver leads to split thorax phenotype in adults, suggesting an essential role of LSD-1 in development of Drosophila thorax. As overexpression of JNK homolog, bsk (basket) suppresses Lsd-1 knockdown phenotype, the role of LSD-1 in thorax development was proved to be dependent on the activity of the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The puckered (puc) expression led to significant decrease in the JNK activity in wing discs of Lsd-1 knockdown flies. In addition, we also detected that depletion of Lsd-1 enhances apoptotic cell death in the wing notum area. Taken together, these data demonstrated that LSD-1 functions in Drosophila thorax development by regulating JNK pathway. "
positive,"Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus modulates innate immune suppression through the eIF4E-eIF4A axis in the insect Spodoptera litura. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is regulated during the innate immune response. However, its translational regulation under innate immune suppression remains largely unexplored. Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), a symbiotic virus harbored by the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus, suppresses innate immunity in parasitized Spodoptera litura. Here, we generated eIF4E dsRNA and used it to silence the eIF4E gene of S. litura, resulting in a hallmark immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis of hemocytes and retardation of head capsule width development. In response to natural parasitism, loss of eIF4E function was associated with similar immunosuppression, and we detected no significant differences between the response to parasitism and treatment with eIF4E RNAi. Under MbBV infection, eIF4E overexpression significantly suppressed MbBV-induced increase in apoptosis and suppressed apoptosis to the same extent as co-expression of both eIF4E and eIF4A. There were no significant differences between MbBV-infected and uninfected larvae in which eIF4E was overexpressed. More importantly, in the eIF4E RNAi strain, eIF4A RNAi did not increase apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that eIF4E plays a nodal role in the MbBV-suppressed innate immune response via the eIF4E-eIF4A axis. "
positive,"In situ hybridization to the Rdl locus on polytene chromosome 3L of Anopheles stephensi. We are interested in generating a Y-autosome translocation of the Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) locus in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae), for use in sterile insect release. To ensure stability of the system, a recombination suppressing inversion can also be induced which encompasses the Rdl locus. As a first step, here we report the cloning of fragments of the Rdl gene from both An. stephensi and An. gambiae Giles using degenerate primers in the polymerase chain reaction. These fragments encode the second membrane-spanning region of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor and show high levels of both nucleotide and predicted amino acid identity to other Rdl-like receptors. They confirm that, as in all other arthropod species examined, dieldrin resistance in An. stephensi is associated with replacement of alanine302, in this case with a serine. In situ hybridization of the Rdl probe to polytene chromosomes of An. stephensi localizes the gene to the left arm of chromosome 3 (3L) in region 45C. Rdl localization will enable us to identify chromosomal rearrangements encompassing the Rdl locus and help anchor the genome sequence of An. gambiae to the polytene map. "
negative,"Beetle genomes in the 21st century: prospects, progress and priorities. The order Coleoptera (beetles) is arguably the most species-rich lineage of animals. Beetles exhibit an extraordinary variety of life histories and occupy most terrestrial environments. Whole genome sequences are available for 11 beetle species, only six of which have been published. Studies of beetle genomes have revealed remarkable new insights into the genomic basis and evolution of beetle life histories and other aspects of beetle biodiversity, including the genes underlying chemoperception, detoxification, and specialized plant feeding, as well as the role of horizontal gene transfer in elaboration of the beetle trophic repertoire. Nonetheless, such studies are in their infancy. The study of beetle genomes has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of beetle biodiversity, but genomic studies of beetles remain seriously limited in scope and resolution by the very few genomes that are currently available for study. "
positive,"Identification and RNAi-based function analysis of chitinase family genes in diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. BACKGROUND: Insect chitinases play a vital part in chitin degradation in exoskeletons and gut linings during the molting process, and therefore are considered potential targets for new insecticide designs or RNA interference (RNAi)-based pest management. Systematic functional analysis of chitinase genes has already been conducted in several insect pests, but not Plutella xylostella. RESULTS: In this study, 13 full-length chitinase transcripts were obtained in P. xylostella. Developmental and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis revealed that seven chitinase transcripts were periodically expressed during molting stage and mainly expressed in the integument or midgut, including PxCht3, PxCht5, PxCht6-2, PxCht7, PxCht8, PxCht10 and PxCht-h. RNAi-mediated knockdown of these specific expressed genes revealed that PxCht5 and PxCht10 were essential in larval molting, pupation and eclosion, and PxCht7 was indispensable only in eclosion. No significant effects were observed on insect survival or normal development when the rest chitinase transcripts were suppressed by RNAi. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated the function of P. xylostella chitinase family genes during the molting process, and may provide potential targets for RNAi-based management of P. xylostella. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"The genome of the stick insect Medauroidea extradentata is strongly methylated within genes and repetitive DNA. BACKGROUND: Cytosine DNA methylation has been detected in many eukaryotic organisms and has been shown to play an important role in development and disease of vertebrates including humans. Molecularly, DNA methylation appears to be involved in the suppression of initiation or of elongation of transcription. Resulting organismal functions are suggested to be the regulation of gene silencing, the suppression of transposon activity and the suppression of initiation of transcription within genes. However, some data concerning the distribution of methylcytosine in insect species appear to contradict such roles. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By comparison of MspI and HpaII restriction patterns in genomic DNA of several insects we show that stick insects (Phasmatodea) have highly methylated genomes. We isolated methylated DNA fragments from the Vietnamese Walking Stick Medauroidea extradentata (formerly known as Baculum extradentatum) and demonstrated that most of the corresponding sequences are repetitive. Bisulfite sequencing of one of these fragments and of parts of conserved protein-coding genes revealed a methylcytosine content of 12.6%, mostly found at CpG, but also at CpT and CpA dinucleotides. Corresponding depletions of CpG and enrichments of TpG and CpA dinucleotides in some highly conserved protein-coding genes of Medauroidea reach a similar degree as in vertebrates and show that CpG methylation has occurred in the germline of these insects. CONCLUSIONS: Using four different methods, we demonstrate that the genome of Medauroidea extradentata is strongly methylated. Both repetitive DNA and coding genes appear to contain high levels of methylcytosines. These results argue for similar functions of DNA methylation in stick insects as those already known for vertebrates. "
negative,"Simplify, simplify: Lifestyle and compact genome of the body louse provide a unique functional genomics opportunity. The body louse, with its recently sequenced genome, is now primed to serve as a powerful model organism for addressing fundamental questions relating to how insects interact with their environment. One characteristic of the body louse that facilitates this research is the size of its genome-the smallest insect genome sequenced to date. This diminutive genome must nonetheless control an organism that senses and responds to its environment, reacting to threats of corporal and genomic integrity. Additionally, the body louse transmits several important human diseases compared to its very close relative, the head louse, which does not. Therefore, these two organisms comprise an excellent model system for studying molecular mechanisms associated with vector competence. To understand more fully the development of vector / pathogen interactions, we have developed an in vitro bioassay system and determined that the body louse genome appears to contain the genes necessary for RNAi. The body louse will therefore be useful for determining the set of conditions permissive to the evolution of vector competence. "
positive,"Physiological functions of a methuselah-like G protein coupled receptor in Lymantria dispar Linnaeus. Insect G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified as a highly attractive target for new generation insecticides discovery due to their critical physiological functions. However, few insect GPCRs have been functionally characterized. Here, we cloned the full length of a methuselah-like GPCR gene (Ldmthl1) from the Asian gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. We then characterized the secondary and tertiary structures of Ldmthl1. We also predicted the global structure of this insect GPCR protein which is composed of three major domains. RNA interference of Ldmthl1 resulted in a reduction of gypsy moths' resistance to deltamethrin and suppressed expression of downstream stress-associated genes, such as P450s, glutathione S transferases, and heat shock proteins. The function of Ldmthl1 was further investigated using transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila with overexpression of Ldmthl1 showed significantly longer lifespan than control flies. Taken together, our studies revealed that the physiological functions of Ldmthl1 in L. dispar are associated with longevity and resistance to insecticide stresses. Potentially, Ldmthl1 can be used as a target for new insecticide discovery in order to manage this notorious forest pest. "
negative,"Genomic evidence of genetic variation with pleiotropic effects on caterpillar fitness and plant traits in a model legume. Plant-insect interactions are ubiquitous, and have been studied intensely because of their relevance to damage and pollination in agricultural plants, and to the ecology and evolution of biodiversity. Variation within species can affect the outcome of these interactions. Specific genes and chemicals that mediate these interactions have been identified, but genome- or metabolome-scale studies might be necessary to better understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of intraspecific variation for plant-insect interactions. Here, we present such a study. Specifically, we assess the consequences of genome-wide genetic variation in the model plant Medicago truncatula for Lycaeides melissa caterpillar growth and survival (larval performance). Using a rearing experiment and a whole-genome SNP data set (>5 million SNPs), we found that polygenic variation in M. truncatula explains 9%-41% of the observed variation in caterpillar growth and survival. Genetic correlations among caterpillar performance and other plant traits, including structural defences and some anonymous chemical features, suggest that multiple M. truncatula alleles have pleiotropic effects on plant traits and caterpillar performance (or that substantial linkage disequilibrium exists among distinct loci affecting subsets of these traits). A moderate proportion of the genetic effect of M. truncatula alleles on L. melissa performance can be explained by the effect of these alleles on the plant traits we measured, especially leaf toughness. Taken together, our results show that intraspecific genetic variation in M. truncatula has a substantial effect on the successful development of L. melissa caterpillars (i.e., on a plant-insect interaction), and further point toward traits potentially mediating this genetic effect. "
negative,"Application of a dense genetic map for assessment of genomic responses to selection and inbreeding in Heliothis virescens. Adaptation of pest species to laboratory conditions and selection for resistance to toxins in the laboratory are expected to cause inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Heliothis virescens, a major cotton pest, has been colonized in the laboratory many times, and a few laboratory colonies have been selected for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) resistance. We developed 350-bp double-digest restriction-site associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) molecular markers to examine and compare changes in genetic variation associated with laboratory adaptation, artificial selection and inbreeding in this nonmodel insect species. We found that allelic and nucleotide diversity declined dramatically in laboratory-reared H. virescens as compared with field-collected populations. The declines were primarily a result of the loss of low frequency alleles present in field-collected H. virescens. A further, albeit modest decline in genetic diversity was observed in a Bt-selected population. The greatest decline was seen in H. virescens that were sib-mated for 10 generations, in which more than 80% of loci were fixed for a single allele. To determine which regions of the genome were resistant to fixation in our sib-mated line, we generated a dense intraspecific linkage map containing three PCR-based and 659 ddRAD-seq markers. Markers that retained polymorphism were observed in small clusters spread over multiple linkage groups, but this clustering was not statistically significant. Overall, we have confirmed and extended the general expectations for reduced genetic diversity in laboratory colonies, provided tools for further genomic analyses and produced highly homozygous genomic DNA for future whole genome sequencing of H. virescens. "
positive,"Characterization of a broad-based mosquito yeast interfering RNA larvicide with a conserved target site in mosquito semaphorin-1a genes. BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi), which has facilitated functional characterization of mosquito neural development genes such as the axon guidance regulator semaphorin-1a (sema1a), could one day be applied as a new means of vector control. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) may represent an effective interfering RNA expression system that could be used directly for delivery of RNA pesticides to mosquito larvae. Here we describe characterization of a yeast larvicide developed through bioengineering of S. cerevisiae to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a conserved site in mosquito sema1a genes. RESULTS: Experiments conducted on Aedes aegypti larvae demonstrated that the yeast larvicide effectively silences sema1a expression, generates severe neural defects, and induces high levels of larval mortality in laboratory, simulated-field, and semi-field experiments. The larvicide was also found to induce high levels of Aedes albopictus, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies indicate that use of yeast interfering RNA larvicides targeting mosquito sema1a genes may represent a new biorational tool for mosquito control. "
negative,"Evolutionary analysis of herbivorous insects in natural and agricultural environments. Herbivorous insects offer a remarkable example of the biological diversity that formed the foundation for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The ability of insects to evolve resistance rapidly to insecticides and host-plant resistance present a continual challenge for pest management. This paper considers the manner in which genetic constraints, host-plant availability and trade-offs affect the evolution of herbivorous insects in natural and agricultural environments, and the extent to which lessons learned from studying natural systems may be applied to improve insect resistance management in agricultural systems. Studies on the genetic architecture of adaptation by herbivores to host plants and to insecticides are reviewed. The genetic basis of resistance is an important component of simulation models that predict the evolution of resistance. These models often assume monogenic resistance, but available data suggest that this assumption may be overly narrow and that modeling of resistance as oligogenic or polygenic may be more appropriate. As omics (e.g. genomics and proteomics) technologies become more accessible, a better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance will be possible. Trade-offs often accompany adaptations by herbivores. Trade-offs arise when the benefit of a trait, such as the ability to feed on a novel host plant or to survive in the presence of an insecticide, is counterbalanced by fitness costs that decrease fitness in the absence of the selective agent. For resistance to insecticides, and resistance to insecticidal transgenic crops in particular, fitness costs may act as an evolutionary constraint and delay or prevent the evolution of resistance. An important observation is that certain ecological factors such as host plants and entomopathogens can magnify fitness costs, which is termed ecological negative cross-resistance. The application of omics technologies may allow for more efficient identification of factors that will impose ecological negative cross-resistance, thereby bolstering insect resistance management. "
negative,"The PKA-CREB system encoded by the honeybee genome. The cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) plays a crucial part in long-term memory formation in the honeybee (Apis mellifera). One of the putative substrates of the PKA activity is the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor in the bZIP protein family. We searched the honeybee genome to characterize genes from the CREB / CREM and the PKA families. We identified two genes that encode regulatory subunits and three genes encode catalytic subunits of PKA. Eight genes code for bZIP proteins, but only one gene was found that encodes a member of the CREB / CREM family. The phylogenetic relationship of these genes was analysed with their Drosophila and human counterparts. "
negative,"Construction and application of an HSP70 promoter-inducible genome editing system in transgenic silkworm to induce resistance to Nosema bombycis. The microsporidian Nosema bombycis is an obligate intracellular parasitic fungus that causes devastating disease in sericulture. To date, no efficient biotechnological method to inhibit the proliferation of microspores has been established. Here, we developed a powerful genetic engineering technique involving microsporidia-inducible genome editing in transgenic silkworm that confers resistance to N. bombycis. This system includes an HSP70 promoter-induced expression of the Cas9 protein line and a target BmATAD3A gene line. The double-positive HSP70-Cas9(+)×sgATAD3A(+) lines were obtained by hybridization and activation of the CRISPR / Cas9 system under the condition of microsporidia infection, although it is silenced in uninfected individuals. Genome editing analysis showed that the system could efficiently edit the BmATAD3A gene and induce large deletions. It is notable that the HSP70-induced system could effectively improve the survival rate of transgenic silkworm after microsporidia infection and inhibit the expression of key microsporidia genes. Moreover, no significant developmental differences between the transgenic silkworms infected with microsporidia and normal individuals were observed. In this study, we effectively inhibited microsporidia proliferation in transgenic individuals through disruptive techniques, thereby providing a method for microsporidia treatment and prevention, paving the way for economically advantageous insect breeding. "
positive,"Bombyxin / Akt signaling in relation to the embryonic diapause process of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Our previous study showed that phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β is related to the embryonic diapause process in Bombyx. However, the upstream signaling pathway was not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined bombyxin / Akt signaling in relation to the embryonic diapause process of B. mori. Results showed that GSK-3β phosphorylation stimulated by dechorionation was blocked by LY294002, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, indicating involvement of PI3K in GSK-3β phosphorylation in dechorionated eggs. Direct determination of Akt phosphorylation showed that dechorionation stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The Akt phosphorylation was blocked by LY294002. Temporal changes in Akt phosphorylation showed that different changing patterns exist between diapause and developing eggs. Relatively higher phosphorylation levels of Akt were detected between days 3 and 5 after oviposition in non-diapause eggs compared to those at the same stages in diapause eggs. Upon treatment with HCl, which prevents diapause initiation, Akt phosphorylation levels exhibited a later and much broader peak compared to diapause eggs. Examination of expression levels of the bombyxin-Z1 gene showed that in diapause eggs, a major peak occurred 1 day after oviposition, and its level then sharply decreased on day 2. However, in both non-diapause and HCl-treated eggs, a major broad peak was detected between days 1 and 4 after oviposition. These temporal changes in bombyxin-Z1 gene expression levels during embryonic stages coincided with changes in Akt phosphorylation, indicating that bombyxin-Z1 is likely an upstream signaling component for Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicated that PI3K / Akt is an upstream signaling pathway for GSK-3β phosphorylation and is associated with the diapause process of B. mori eggs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential correlation between bombyxin / Akt signaling and the embryonic diapause process. "
negative,"Construction and long term preservation of clonal transgenic silkworms using a parthenogenetic strain. For the functional analysis of insect genes as well as for the production of recombinant proteins for biomedical use, clonal transgenic silkworms are very useful. We examined if they could be produced in the parthenogenetic strain that had been maintained for more than 40years as a female line in which embryogenesis is induced with nearly 100% efficiency by a heat shock treatment of unfertilized eggs. All individuals have identical female genotype. Silkworm transgenesis requires injection of the DNA constructs into the non-diapausing eggs at the preblastodermal stage of embryogenesis. Since our parthenogenetic silkworms produce diapausing eggs, diapause programing was eliminated by incubating ovaries of the parthenogenetic strain in standard male larvae. Chorionated eggs were dissected from the implants, activated by the heat shock treatment and injected with the transgene construct. Several transgenic individuals occurred in the daughter generation. Southern blotting analysis of two randomly chosen transgenic lines VTG1 and VTG14 revealed multiple transgene insertions. Insertions found in the parental females were transferred to the next generation without any changes in their sites and copy numbers, suggesting that transgenic silkworms can be maintained as clonal strains with homozygous transgenes. Cryopreservation was developed for the storage of precious genotypes. As shown for the VTG1 and VTG14 lines, larval ovaries can be stored in DMSO at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, transferred to Grace's medium during defrosting, and then implanted into larvae of either sex of the standard silkworm strains C146 and w1-pnd. Chorionated eggs, which developed in the implants, were dissected and activated by the heat shock to obtain females (nearly 100% efficiency) or by a cold shock to induce development to both sexes in 4% of the eggs. It was then possible to establish bisexual lines homozygous for the transgene.  "
negative,"Genomic evidence for complementary purine metabolism in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. The purine salvage pathway recycles purines to nucleotides, promoting efficient utilization of purine nucleotides. Exceptionally among animals with completely sequenced genomes, the pea aphid lacks key purine recycling genes that code for purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase, indicating that the aphid can neither metabolize nucleosides to the corresponding purines, nor adenosine to inosine. Purine metabolism genes in the symbiotic bacterium Buchnera complement aphid genes, and Buchnera can meet its nucleotide requirement from aphid-derived guanosine. Buchnera demand for nucleosides may have relaxed the selection for purine recycling in the aphid, leading to the loss of key aphid purine salvage genes. Further, the coupled purine metabolism of aphid and Buchnera could contribute to the dependence of the pea aphid on this symbiosis. "
positive,"Primary structure of apolipophorin-III from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Potential amphipathic structures and molecular evolution of an insect apolipoprotein. The amino acid sequence of an insect apolipoprotein, apolipophorin-III from Locusta migratoria, has been deduced from the sequence of its cloned cDNA. The mature hemolymph protein consists of 161 amino acids. Optimized alignments of this protein with apolipophorin-III from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, disclosed an overall sequence identity of only 29%, even though the two proteins are functionally equivalent. The L. migratoria sequence is composed of 12 repeating peptides that are variable in length. Six amphipathic helical segments of varying length were identified in each protein using a newly described algorithm for detecting such secondary structures. The degree of sequence identity between the two insect apoproteins is considerably less than that observed among orthologous mammalian apolipoproteins. However, calculation of the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions indicates that the insect genes may be evolving at rates similar to the mammalian apolipoprotein genes. Further comparative analyses of insect and mammalian apolipoproteins should provide insights about the limits of sequence diversity tolerated by their predicted amphipathic helical domains. "
positive,"Brownie, a gene involved in building complex respiratory devices in insect eggshells. BACKGROUND: Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for respiration and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the follicle cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicate that the novel gene Brownie plays a pivotal role in building up the sponge-like body. Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures. "
positive,"The expression of cockroach insulin-like peptides is differentially regulated by physiological conditions and affected by compensatory regulation. In insects, the insulin receptor (InR) pathway is involved in regulating key physiological processes, including juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis, vitellogenin production, and oocyte growth. This raises the question about which ligand (or ligands) binds to InR to trigger the above effects. We have cloned seven insulin-like peptides (BgILP1 to 7) from female Blattella germanica cockroaches and found that the brain expresses BgILP1 to 6, the fat body BgILP7, and the ovary BgILP2. Starvation induces the reduction of BgILP3, 5, and 6 mRNA levels in the brain, and the various BgILPs are differentially expressed during the gonadotrophic cycle. In addition, by knocking down the BgILPs we were able to identify compensatory regulation at transcriptional level between the different BgILPs, although none of the BgILP knockdown assays, including the knockdown of the seven BgILPs, produced the same phenotypes that we achieved by depleting InR. Taken together, the results indicate that B. germanica ILPs are differentially expressed in tissues and in response to physiological conditions, and that they are affected by compensatory regulation. "
negative,"Copy number variations among silkworms. BACKGROUND: Copy number variations (CNVs), which are important source for genetic and phenotypic variation, have been shown to be associated with disease as well as important QTLs, especially in domesticated animals. However, little is known about the CNVs in silkworm. RESULTS: In this study, we have constructed the first CNVs map based on genome-wide analysis of CNVs in domesticated silkworm. Using next-generation sequencing as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR), we identified ~319 CNVs in total and almost half of them (~ 49%) were distributed on uncharacterized chromosome. The CNVs covered 10.8 Mb, which is about 2.3% of the entire silkworm genome. Furthermore, approximately 61% of CNVs directly overlapped with SDs in silkworm. The genes in CNVs are mainly related to reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition, which is consistent with the observations in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: An initial CNVs map for silkworm has been described in this study. And this map provides new information for genetic variations in silkworm. Furthermore, the silkworm CNVs may play important roles in reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition. This study provided insight into the evolution of the silkworm genome and an invaluable resource for insect genomics research. "
negative,"Baculovirus diversity and molecular biology. With the identification and characterization of a number of structural and nonstructural protein genes, advances have been made in our understanding of baculovirus structure, regulation of gene expression, and replication. Since less than 30% of the AcMNPV genome has been sequenced and characterized, the continued identification and assignment of function to baculovirus genes is perhaps the most crucial of enterprises now facing baculovirologists and is critical to the development of our understanding of the baculovirus genome and its replication. The size and diversity of baculovirus genomes appears to be strongly influenced by mobile DNA from the insect host. Also, transposon-mediated mutations of baculoviruses provide examples of functional inactivation of viral genes (FP phenotype mutations) and transcriptional activation (TE-D insertion). Another role transposable elements may play is the introduction of insect promoters and enhancers to the baculovirus genome. Since early baculovirus genes are likely transcribed in a way similar to normal insect genes, transposons that insert strong constitutive promoters or cellular enhancers near early baculovirus genes may cause mutations that are subsequently selected for. If this does occur, baculovirus early gene promoters may exhibit a great deal of variability in sequence and may resemble host promoters. Given the overall similarity between the genomes of OpMNPV and AcMNPV and the apparent absence of a region, similar to the AcMNPV HindIII-K / EcoR1-S in OpMNPV, it is intriguing to speculate that this region which contains two ORFs and the hr5 enhancer, may have been inserted into the AcMNPV genome by transposition, possibly delivering several helpful genes (35k and 94k) and a powerful enhancer. The highly repeated enhancer may have been subsequently amplified by recombination. In such a model, the acquisition of general or species-specific enhancers might influence both virulence and host range. Acquisition of general enhancers could increase the level of early gene expression, thus accelerating the cellular infection cycle and making the virus more virulent. Similarly, the acquisition of species-specific enhancers might affect host range by accelerating the infection cycle, but only in a specific host or cell type. One might therefore postulate that diversity in baculoviruses may reflect not only different selection pressures but also the diversity of mobile DNA within host insect species. Although our understanding of baculovirus diversity and molecular biology is rapidly advancing, many of the fundamental characteristics that define the unique nature of baculoviruses remain poorly understood. One fundamental feature of baculoviruses is the production of the two virion phenotypes, PDV and BV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
positive,"DDC plays vital roles in the wing spot formation, egg production, and chorion tanning in the brown planthopper. The gene dopa decarboxylase (Nlddc) of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) was identified in the genome and transcriptome of the insect. The open reading frame of Nlddc is 1,434 bp in length and, it has the potential to encode a protein of 477 amino acid with a conserved pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain and a typical motif, NFNPHKW. Real-time quantification polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that this gene was highly expressed in the integument and brain, and transcript level peaked in the late stages of egg period and each nymph instar with periodicity. RNA interference results revealed that Nlddc played essential roles in pigment synthesis, formation of wing spot, egg production, and tanning of the chorion. A rapid accumulation of Nlddc transcripts was detected, and it coincided with the injection of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), suggesting that Nlddc transcription was regulated by 20E. "
positive,"Identification of chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome of Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella. Olfaction plays an indispensable role in mediating insect behavior, such as locating host plants, mating partners, and avoidance of toxins and predators. Olfactory-related proteins are required for olfactory perception of insects. However, very few olfactory-related genes have been reported in Plodia interpunctella up to now. In the present study, we sequenced the antennae transcriptome of P. interpunctella using the next-generation sequencing technology, and identified 117 candidate olfactory-related genes, including 29 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), three sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 47 odorant receptors (ORs), 14 ionotropic receptors (IRs) and nine gustatory receptors (GRs). Further analysis of qRT-PCR revealed that nine OBPs, three CSPs, two SNMPs, nine ORs and two GRs were specifically expressed in the male antennae, whereas eight OBPs, six CSPs, one SNMP, 16 ORs, two GRs and seven IRs significantly expressed in the female antennae. Taken together, our results provided useful information for further functional studies on insect genes related to recognition of pheromone and odorant, which might be meaningful targets for pest management. "
negative,"piggyBac-based insertional mutagenesis and enhancer detection as a tool for functional insect genomics. Transposon mutagenesis provides a fundamental tool for functional genomics. Here we present a non-species-specific, combined enhancer detection and binary expression system based on the transposable element piggyBac: For the different components of this insertional mutagenesis system, we used widely applicable transposons and distinguishable broad-range transformation markers, which should enable this system to be operational in nonmodel arthropods. In a pilot screen in Drosophila melanogaster, piggyBac mutator elements on the X chromosome were mobilized in males by a Hermes-based jumpstarter element providing piggyBac transposase activity under control of the alpha1-tubulin promoter. As primary reporters in the piggyBac mutator elements, we employed the heterologous transactivators GAL4delta or tTA. To identify larval and adult enhancer detectors, strains carrying UASp-EYFP or TRE-EYFP as secondary reporter elements were used. Tissue-specific enhancer activities were readily observed in the GAL4delta / UASp-based systems, but only rarely in the tTA / TRE system. Novel autosomal insertions were recovered with an average jumping rate of 80%. Of these novel insertions, 3.8% showed homozygous lethality, which was reversible by piggyBac excision. Insertions were found in both coding and noncoding regions of characterized genes and also in noncharacterized and non-P-targeted CG-number genes. This indicates that piggyBac will greatly facilitate the intended saturation mutagenesis in Drosophila. "
negative,"Complete sequences of mitochondria genomes of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus and comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA fragments inserted in the nuclear genomes. We present complete sequences of the mitochondrial genomes for two important mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, that are major vectors of dengue virus and lymphatic filariasis, respectively. The A. aegypti mitochondrial genome is 16,655 bp in length and that of C. quinquefasciatus is 15,587 bp, yet both contain 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, one 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, one 16S rRNA gene and a control region (CR) in the same order. The difference in the genome size is due to the difference in the length of the control region. We also analyzed insertions of nuclear copies of mtDNA-like sequences (NUMTs) in a comparative manner between the two mosquitoes. The NUMT sequences occupy ~0.008% of the A. aegypti genome and ~0.001% of the C. quinquefasciatus genome. Several NUMTs were found localized in the introns of predicted protein coding genes in both genomes (32 genes in A. aegypti but only four in C. quinquefasciatus). None of these NUMT-containing genes had an ortholog between the two species or had paralogous copies within a genome that was also NUMT-containing. It was further observed that the NUMT-containing genes were relatively longer but had lower GC content compared to the NUMT-less paralogous copies. Moreover, stretches of homologies are present among the genic and non-genic NUMTs that may play important roles in genomic rearrangement of NUMTs in these genomes. Our study provides new insights on understanding the roles of nuclear mtDNA sequences in genome complexities of these mosquitoes. "
negative,"Large-scale recoding of an arbovirus genome to rebalance its insect versus mammalian preference. The protein synthesis machineries of two distinct phyla of the Animal kingdom, insects of Arthropoda and mammals of Chordata, have different preferences for how to best encode proteins. Nevertheless, arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are capable of infecting both mammals and insects just like arboviruses that use insect vectors to infect plants. These organisms have evolved carefully balanced genomes that can efficiently use the translational machineries of different phyla, even if the phyla belong to different kingdoms. Using dengue virus as an example, we have undone the genome encoding balance and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from mammals. These mammalian-attenuated viruses grow to high titers in insect cells but low titers in mammalian cells, have dramatically increased LD50s in newborn mice, and induce high levels of protective antibodies. Recoded arboviruses with a bias toward phylum-specific expression could form the basis of a new generation of live attenuated vaccine candidates.  "
positive,"karmoisin and cardinal ortholog genes participate in the ommochrome synthesis of Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Ommochrome is the major source for eye coloration of all insect species so far examined. Phenoxazinone synthetase (PHS) has always been regarded as the terminal step enzyme for ommochrome formation, which is encoded by cardinal or karmoisin genes. Our previous study indicated that the karmoisin ortholog gene (Nl-karmoisin) product in the brown planthopper (BPH) was a monocarboxylate transporter, while not a PHS. Here, based on full-length complementary DNA, the cardinal ortholog gene in BPH (Nl-cardinal) product was predicted to be a haem peroxidase rather than a PHS. We suggest for the first time that neither karmoisin nor cardinal encodes the PHS, but whether PHS participates in BPH eye pigmentation needs further research. Nymphal RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that knockdown Nl-cardinal transcript led the BPH ocelli and compound eye to color change from brown to red, while knockdown Nl-karmoisin only made the ocelli present the red phenotype. Notably, not only the Nl-cardinal transcript, dscd injection (Nl-cardinal targeting double-stranded DNA (dsRNA)) also significantly reduced the Nl-karmoisin transcript by 33.7%, while dska (Nl-karmoisin targeting dsRNA) injection did not significantly change the Nl-cardinal transcript. Considering the above RNAi and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results, we propose that Nl-cardinal plays a more important role in ommochrome synthesis than Nl-karmoisin, and it may be an upstream gene of Nl-karmoisin. The present study suggested that both karmoisin and cardinal ortholog genes play a role in ommochrome synthesis in a hemimetabolous insect. "
negative,"Identification of a cDNA encoding a retinoid X receptor homologue from Schistosoma mansoni. Evidence for a role in female-specific gene expression. Schistosoma mansoni, a multicelluar eukaryotic blood fluke, is a major cause of morbidity worldwide in humans. The study of female parasite growth, development, and gene regulation is important because the eggs produced are responsible for the pathogenesis observed in schistosomiasis. p14, an eggshell precursor gene expressed only in sexually mature females in response to a male stimulus, is a model for female-specific gene regulation. The upstream region of the p14 gene shares sequences present in insect genes known to be regulated in a sex-, temporal-, and tissue-specific manner by members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a cDNA that encodes the S. mansoni (Sm) RXR homologue. Sequence analysis predicts and Western blot analysis confirms the synthesis of a 74-kDa protein, the largest member of the RXR family reported to date. We show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis that SmRXR binds to cis-elements of the p14 gene including a direct repeat that follows the ""3-4-5"" rule of binding elements recognized by members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SmRXR can act as a transcription activator in the yeast one-hybrid system. Through quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show that the SmRXR gene is constitutively expressed and thus must play multiple roles throughout the schistosome life cycle. "
negative,"Influence of host plant, geography and pheromone strain on genomic differentiation in sympatric populations of Ostrinia nubilalis. Patterns of mating for the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) moth depend in part on variation in sex-pheromone blend. The ratio of (E)-11- and (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11- and Z11-14:OAc) in the pheromone blend that females produce and males respond to differs between strains of O. nubilalis. Populations also vary in female oviposition preference for and larval performance on maize (C4) and nonmaize (C3) host plants. The relative contributions of sexual and ecological trait variation to the genetic structure of O. nubilalis remains unknown. Host-plant use (13 C / 14 C ratios) and genetic differentiation were estimated among sympatric E and Z pheromone strain O. nubilalis males collected in sex-pheromone baited traps at 12 locations in Pennsylvania and New York between 2007 and 2010. Among genotypes at 65 single nucleotide polymorphism marker loci, variance at a position in the pheromone gland fatty acyl-reductase (pgfar) gene at the locus responsible for determining female pheromone ratio (Pher) explained 64% of the total genetic differentiation between males attracted to different pheromones (male response, Resp), providing evidence of sexual inter-selection at these unlinked loci. Principal coordinate, Bayesian clustering, and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) demonstrate that host plant history or geography does not significantly contribute to population variation or differentiation among males. In contrast, these analyses indicate that pheromone response and pgfar-defined strain contribute significantly to population genetic differentiation. This study suggests that behavioural divergence probably plays a larger role in driving genetic variation compared to host plant-defined ecological adaptation. "
negative,"Evidence for involvement of a transformer paralogue in sex determination of the wasp Leptopilina clavipes. Transformer (tra) is the central gear in many insect sex determination pathways and transduces a wide range of primary signals. Mediated by transformer-2 (tra2) it directs sexual development into the female or male mode. Duplications of tra have been detected in numerous Hymenoptera, but a function in sex determination has been confirmed only in Apis mellifera. We identified a tra2 orthologue (Lc-tra2), a tra orthologue (Lc-tra) and a tra paralogue (Lc-traB) in the genome of Leptopilina clavipes (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae). We compared the sequence and structural conservation of these genes between sexual (arrhenotokous) and asexual all-female producing (thelytokous) individuals. Lc-tra is sex-specifically spliced in adults consistent with its orthologous function. The male-specific regions of Lc-tra are conserved in both reproductive modes. The paralogue Lc-traB lacks the genomic region coding for male-specific exons and can only be translated into a full-length TRA-like peptide sequence. Furthermore, unlike LC-TRA, the LC-TRAB interstrain sequence variation is not differentiated into a sexual and an asexual haplotype. The LC-TRAB protein interacts with LC-TRA as well as LC-TRA2. This suggests that Lc-traB functions as a conserved element in sex determination of sexual and asexual individuals. "
positive,"Functional analysis by RNAi of an glutaredoxin gene in Helicoverpa armigera. Glutaredoxins play crucial roles in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis via scavenging of excess reactive oxygen species. In this study, a glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich gene from Helicoverpa armigera, named HaGdccr, was characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that it contains a glutaredoxin domain and a conserved cysteine and shares high sequence identity with other insect genes. HaGdccr mRNA expression was highest in molting larvae of the 3rd instar and was mainly detected in the central nervous system of larvae and the wings of adults. Quantitative real-time PCR results revealed that the expression of HaGdccr was suppressed at 1 and 6 h and increased at 24 h after the larvae were treated with 4 °C and hydrogen peroxide. When the larvae were exposed to 20 °C, HaGdccr decreased at 1 h and was induced at 12 and 24 h. HaGdccr transcription level was downregulated at 2 and 12 h and upregulated at 24 h after the adults were exposed to 0 °C. However, transcript levels were increased by high temperature in both larvae and adults. After knockdown of HaGdccr by RNA interference, the expression of antioxidant genes, including thioredoxin-like (Trx-like), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin (Trx), was increased, whereas that of thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) was decreased. In addition, we found that HaGdccr knockdown enhanced the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and the contents of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate. Taken together, these results indicate that HaGdccr may play significant roles in protecting organisms against oxidative damage. "
negative,"Peripheral olfactory signaling in insects. Olfactory signaling is a crucial component in the life history of insects. The development of precise and parallel mechanisms to analyze the tremendous amount of chemical information from the environment and other sources has been essential to their evolutionary success. Considerable progress has been made in the study of insect olfaction fueled by bioinformatics- based utilization of genomics along with rapid advances in functional analyses. Here we review recent progress in our rapidly emerging understanding of insect peripheral sensory reception and signal transduction. These studies reveal that the nearly unlimited chemical space insects encounter is covered by distinct chemosensory receptor repertoires that are generally derived by species-specific, rapid gene gain and loss, reflecting the evolutionary consequences of adaptation to meet their specific biological needs. While diverse molecular mechanisms have been put forth, often in the context of controversial models, the characterization of the ubiquitous, highly conserved and insect-specific Orco odorant receptor co-receptor has opened the door to the design and development of novel insect control methods to target agricultural pests, disease vectors and even nuisance insects. "
positive,"The NompC channel regulates Nilaparvata lugens proprioception and gentle-touch response. NompC channel is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily. It can regulate gentle-touch, locomotion, hearing and food texture detection in Drosophila. We cloned the NompC gene of Nilaparvata lugens (NlNompC). The full length NlNompC possessed similar structure as DmNompC, which belongs to TRPN subfamily. The expression pattern analysis of different developmental stages and body parts showed that the transcription of NlNompC was more abundant in adult stage and in the abdomen. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of NlNompC in the third-instar nymphs successfully knocked down the target gene with 75% suppression. At nine days after injection, the survival rate of dsRNA injected nymphs was as low as 9.84%. Behavioral observation revealed that the locomotion of the dsRNA injected nymphs was defective with much less movement compared to the negative control. Feeding and honeydew excretion of the dsRNA injected insects also decreased significantly. These results suggested that NlNompC is a classical mechanotransduction channel that plays important roles in proprioception and locomotion, and is essential for the survival of N. lugens. The results also contribute to the understanding of how TRP channels regulate proprioception. "
positive,"Disruption of sex-specific doublesex exons results in male- and female-specific defects in the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. BACKGROUND: Doublesex (dsx), the downstream gene in the insect sex-determination pathway, is a key regulator of sexually dimorphic development and behavior across a variety of insects. Manipulating expression of dsx could be useful in the genetic control of insects. However, information on the sex-specific function of dsx in non-model insects is lacking. RESULTS: In this work, we isolated a dsx homolog, which is alternatively spliced into six female-specific and one male-specific isoforms, from an important agricultural pest, the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. Studies on the expression of sex-specific Aidsx mRNA during embryonic development showed that the sixth hour post oviposition is the key stage for sex determination in A. ipsilon. Functional analysis of Aidsx was conducted using a CRISPR / Cas9 system targeting female- and male-specific Aidsx exons. Disruptions of sex-specific Aidsx exons resulted in sex-specific, sexually dimorphic defects in external genitals, gonads and antennae, and expression of sex-specific genes as well as production of offspring in both sexes. CONCLUSION: Our results not only demonstrate that dsx is a key player determining A. ipsilon sexually dimorphic traits, but also provide a potential method for the genetic control of this pest. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Over expression of bmo-miR-2819 suppresses BmNPV replication by regulating the BmNPV ie-1 gene in Bombyx mori. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a major pathogen that threatens the growth and sustainability of the sericulture industry. Accumulating studies in recent years suggest that insect viruses infection can change the host microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile and both cellular and viral miRNAs play roles in host-pathogen interactions. Until now, the functional analysis of miRNA encoded by silkworm for host-virus interaction is limited. In this study, we validate the down-regulation of bmo-miR-2819 upon BmNPV infection by qRT-PCR and confirm the BmNPV immediately early 1 gene, ie-1 is one of the targets for bmo-miR-2819 based on the results of dual luciferase report assay. Overexpression of bmo-miR-2819 can significantly decline the abundance of IE-1 protein level in BmNPV-infected silkworm larvae. Further, the expression level of polyhedrin gene and VP39 protein of BmNPV in the infected larvae after applying bmo-miR-2819 mimics was significantly decreased comparing with that of larvae with mimic control. Our results suggest that overexpression of bmo-miR-2819 could suppress BmNPV replication by down-regulating the expression of BmNPV ie-1 gene, which demonstrate that cellular miRNAs could affect virus infection by regulating the expression of virus genes. "
negative,"Complete genome sequences of two insect-specific flaviviruses. We determined the complete genomic sequences of two previously discovered insect-specific flaviviruses, Marisma mosquito virus (MMV) and Nanay virus (NANV), using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and Sanger sequencing. Complete polyprotein amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the closest known relatives of MMV and NANV are Donggang virus (89% identity, 95% similarity) and Nounané virus (53% identity, 70% similarity), respectively. Phylogenetic inference is in agreement with these findings. Potential programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting sites were bioinformatically identified in the genomes of both viruses. "
negative,"The 19 genomes of Drosophila: a BAC library resource for genus-wide and genome-scale comparative evolutionary research. The genus Drosophila has been the subject of intense comparative phylogenomics characterization to provide insights into genome evolution under diverse biological and ecological contexts and to functionally annotate the Drosophila melanogaster genome, a model system for animal and insect genetics. Recent sequencing of 11 additional Drosophila species from various divergence points of the genus is a first step in this direction. However, to fully reap the benefits of this resource, the Drosophila community is faced with two critical needs: i.e., the expansion of genomic resources from a much broader range of phylogenetic diversity and the development of additional resources to aid in finishing the existing draft genomes. To address these needs, we report the first synthesis of a comprehensive set of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resources for 19 Drosophila species from all three subgenera. Ten libraries were derived from the exact source used to generate 10 of the 12 draft genomes, while the rest were generated from a strategically selected set of species on the basis of salient ecological and life history features and their phylogenetic positions. The majority of the new species have at least one sequenced reference genome for immediate comparative benefit. This 19-BAC library set was rigorously characterized and shown to have large insert sizes (125-168 kb), low nonrecombinant clone content (0.3-5.3%), and deep coverage (9.1-42.9×). Further, we demonstrated the utility of this BAC resource for generating physical maps of targeted loci, refining draft sequence assemblies and identifying potential genomic rearrangements across the phylogeny. "
negative,"Targeting symbiosis-related insect genes by RNAi in the pea aphid-Buchnera symbiosis. The growth and reproduction of phloem sap-feeding insects requires the sustained function of intracellular bacteria localized in specialized cells known as bacteriocytes, giving the potential to target the bacterial symbiosis as a novel strategy for controlling sap-feeding insect pests. We focused on two genes in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, amiD and ldcA1, which were acquired horizontally from bacteria and have the annotated function to degrade immunogenic bacterial peptidoglycan. We hypothesized that AmiD and LdcA1 function to eliminate peptidoglycan fragments released by the bacterial symbiont Buchnera inhabiting the bacteriocytes, thereby protecting the Buchnera from host attack. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of amiD and ldcA1 was enriched in bacteriocytes and varied significantly with aphid age, conforming to an inverse curvilinear relationship for amiD and negative linear relationship for ldcA1. RNAi against amiD and ldcA1 administered orally to larval pea aphids caused a significant reduction in Buchnera abundance and activity, accompanied by depressed aphid growth rates. For RNAi experiments, the aphids were co-administered with dsRNA against an aphid nuclease nuc1, protecting the dsRNA against non-specific degradation. These experiments demonstrate that selective suppression of insect symbiosis-related gene function can reduce the performance of an insect pest. Phylogenetic analysis identified amiD and ldcA1 in sequenced genomes of other aphid species, and amiD in related groups of phloem-feeding insects, offering the opportunity for specific controls against a range of insect pests. "
negative,"Constitutive activation of the midgut response to Bacillus thuringiensis in Bt-resistant Spodoptera exigua. Bacillus thuringiensis is the most effective microbial control agent for controlling numerous species from different insect orders. The main threat for the long term use of B. thuringiensis in pest control is the ability of insects to develop resistance. Thus, the identification of insect genes involved in conferring resistance is of paramount importance. A colony of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected for 15 years in the laboratory for resistance to Xentari™, a B. thuringiensis-based insecticide, reaching a final resistance level of greater than 1,000-fold. Around 600 midgut ESTs were analyzed by DNA-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. Among the differentially expressed genes, repat and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with B. thuringiensis resistance. We also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to Xentari™, suggesting a permanent activation of the response to Xentari™ in resistant insects. Increased aminopeptidase activity in the lumen of resistant insects in the absence of exposure to Xentari™ corroborated the hypothesis of permanent activation of response genes. Increase in midgut proliferation has been proposed as a mechanism of response to pathogens in the adult from several insect species. Analysis of S. exigua larvae revealed that midgut proliferation was neither increased in resistant insects nor induced by exposure of susceptible larvae to Xentari™, suggesting that mechanisms other than midgut proliferation are involved in the response to B. thuringiensis by S. exigua larvae. "
negative,"Genome-wide and expression-profiling analyses suggest the main cytochrome P450 genes related to pyrethroid resistance in the malaria vector, Anopheles sinensis (Diptera Culicidae). BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is one of the major malaria vectors. However, pyrethroid resistance in An. sinensis is threatening malaria control. Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification is an important pyrethroid resistance mechanism that has been unexplored in An. sinensis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the An. sinensis P450 gene superfamily with special attention to their role in pyrethroid resistance using bioinformatics and molecular approaches. RESULTS: Our data revealed the presence of 112 individual P450 genes in An. sinensis, which were classified into four major clans (mitochondrial, CYP2, CYP3 and CYP4), 18 families and 50 subfamilies. Sixty-seven genes formed nine gene clusters, and genes within the same cluster and the same gene family had a similar gene structure. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of An. sinensis P450s (82 / 112) had very close 1: 1 orthology with Anopheles gambiae P450s. Five genes (AsCYP6Z2, AsCYP6P3v1, AsCYP6P3v2, AsCYP9J5 and AsCYP306A1) were significantly upregulated in three pyrethroid-resistant populations in both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses, suggesting that they could be the most important P450 genes involved in pyrethroid resistance in An. sinensis. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight on the diversity of An. sinensis P450 superfamily and basis for further elucidating pyrethroid resistance mechanism in this mosquito species. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"cDNA cloning, heat shock regulation and developmental expression of the hsp83 gene in the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. This report presents the cDNA cloning, heat shock regulation and developmental expression of the hsp90 gene homologue of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). The isolated cDNA contained the coding region, the 3'UTR and most of the 5'UTR of the medfly hsp90 homologue, which was named Cchsp83. The deduced CcHSP83 polypeptide contained all the highly conserved amino acid segments that characterize the cytosolic members of the HSP90 family. Genomic analysis showed that the Cchsp83 gene is unique and was mapped at the 94C division of the sixth polytene chromosome. The size of the Cchsp83 mRNA was found to be approximately 2.7 kb. The predicted molecular mass of the CcHSP83 protein was 81.4 kDa, while the apparent molecular weight estimated by SDS-PAGE was approximately 90 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis based on 14 insect HSP90 amino acid sequences was consistent with the known phylogeny at low taxonomic level. The Cchsp83 gene is constitutively expressed in all stages of medfly development and is induced from a low level to several-fold by heat, depending on the developmental stage. Heat shock induction begins at 30 degrees C, reaching a maximum between 35 and 41 degrees C. Cchsp83 RNA expression is highly regulated during embryonic development; however, the temporal fluctuations in RNA levels during embryogenesis were not followed by similar fluctuations in the levels of the protein.

negative,"InSatDb: a genomic tool for insect geneticists. Microsatellites show tremendous variation between genomes in terms of their occurrence and composition. Availability of whole genome sequences allows us to study microsatellite characteristics of fully sequenced insect genomes to understand the evolution and biological significance of microsatellites. InSatDb is an insect microsatellite database that provides an interactive interface to query information on microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and repeat units), genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon), nature (perfect or imperfect), and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). Here we present a snapshot of the distribution and composition of microsatellites in introns and exons of insect genomes. The data present interesting observations regarding the microsatellite life-cycle and genome flux. "
negative,"A new positive-strand RNA virus with unique genome characteristics from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We report the discovery of a new virus with unique genome characteristics from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. This virus represents the second identified from this ant species. It is provisionally named Solenopsis invicta virus 2 (SINV-2). The SINV-2 genome was constructed by compiling sequences from successive 5' RACE reactions, a 3' RACE reaction, and expressed sequence tag, c246 (accession number EH413675), from a fire ant expression library. The SINV-2 genome structure was monopartite, polycistronic and RNA-based. The genome consensus sequence (EF428566) was 11,303 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail present on the 3' end. Analysis of the genome revealed 4 major open reading frames (ORFs; comprised of > or =100 codons) and 5 minor ORFs (comprised of 50-99 codons) in the sense orientation. No large ORFs were found in the inverse orientation suggesting that the SINV-2 genome was from a positive-strand RNA virus. Further evidence for this conclusion includes abolished RT-PCR amplification by RNase treatment of SINV-2 nucleic acid template, and failure to amplify without first conducting cDNA synthesis. Blastp analysis indicated that ORF 4 contained conserved domains of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease, characteristic of positive-strand RNA viruses. However, the protease domain and putative structural proteins (ORFs 1, 2, and 3) were less well conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp, helicase, and ORF 1 indicate unique placement of SINV-2 exclusive from the Dicistroviridae, iflaviruses, Picornaviridae, and plant small RNA viruses. "
negative,"Genome-wide survey for baculoviral host homologs using the Bombyx genome sequence. The Baculoviridae is a large family of pathogens that are infectious for arthropods, particularly insects of the Lepidoptera. Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), a genus of Baculoviridae, have a large circular, supercoiled, and double-stranded DNA genome packaged into rod-shaped virions. The Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV), an NPV pathogenic for B. mori, is known to potentially encode 136 proteins. Using the B. mori genome information, we found that 15 of 136 BmNPV proteins (11%) show significant similarity to the B. mori proteins. Among them, genes encoding nine proteins can be deleted in B. mori cultured cell line BmN by homologous recombination, indicating that these genes are dispensable for normal virus production. Interestingly, most of non-essential auxiliary genes encode proteins controlling host physiology at cellular and / or organismal levels: ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase inactivates an insect molting hormone ecdysone, protein tyrosine phosphatase is involved in wandering behavior at the late stage of infection, fibroblast growth factor induces host cell chemotaxis, and chitinase and cathepsin are required for postmortem host liquefaction. Deletion analysis of other non-essential genes also showed that three of them are viral pathogenicity factors for B. mori. These findings suggest that the modern lepidopteran baculovirus may have acquired auxiliary genes from an ancestral host insect to control host physiology and to increase the efficiency of virus transmission in nature. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification of chitin-binding proteins and characterization of BmCBP1 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting. "
negative,"Anopheles gambiae genome reannotation through synthesis of ab initio and comparative gene prediction algorithms. BACKGROUND: Complete genome annotation is a necessary tool as Anopheles gambiae researchers probe the biology of this potent malaria vector. RESULTS: We reannotate the A. gambiae genome by synthesizing comparative and ab initio sets of predicted coding sequences (CDSs) into a single set using an exon-gene-union algorithm followed by an open-reading-frame-selection algorithm. The reannotation predicts 20,970 CDSs supported by at least two lines of evidence, and it lowers the proportion of CDSs lacking start and / or stop codons to only approximately 4%. The reannotated CDS set includes a set of 4,681 novel CDSs not represented in the Ensembl annotation but with EST support, and another set of 4,031 Ensembl-supported genes that undergo major structural and, therefore, probably functional changes in the reannotated set. The quality and accuracy of the reannotation was assessed by comparison with end sequences from 20,249 full-length cDNA clones, and evaluation of mass spectrometry peptide hit rates from an A. gambiae shotgun proteomic dataset confirms that the reannotated CDSs offer a high quality protein database for proteomics. We provide a functional proteomics annotation, ReAnoXcel, obtained by analysis of the new CDSs through the AnoXcel pipeline, which allows functional comparisons of the CDS sets within the same bioinformatic platform. CDS data are available for download. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive A. gambiae genome reannotation is achieved through a combination of comparative and ab initio gene prediction algorithms. "
negative,"A genomewide survey of homeobox genes and identification of novel structure of the Hox cluster in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Homeobox genes encode transcriptional factors that play crucial roles in a variety of developmental pathways from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes. We have identified 102 homeobox genes in the typical insect of Lepidoptera, Bombyx mori, based on the newly assembled genome sequence with 9X coverage. These identified homeobox genes were categorized into nine classes including at least 74 families. The available ESTs and microarray data at present confirmed that more than half of them were expressed during silkworm developmental processes. Orthologs of pb, zen and ftz were newly identified in the Bombyx Hox cluster on chromosome 6. Interestingly, a special group of 12 tandemly duplicated homeobox genes was found located between Bmpb and Bmzen in the Bombyx Hox cluster, suggesting that Hox cluster might have experienced a lineage-specific expansion in the silkworm. A detailed analysis on genome data reveals that a split exists between Bmlab and Bmpb. Our data provide valuable information for future research on the development and evolution of silkworm. "

"
negative,"Variation in genome size of argasid and ixodid ticks. The suborder Ixodida includes many tick species of medical and veterinary importance, but little is known about the genomic characteristics of these ticks. We report the first study to determine genome size in two species of Argasidae (soft ticks) and seven species of Ixodidae (hard ticks) using flow cytometry analysis of fluorescent stained nuclei. Our results indicate a large haploid genome size (1C>1000 Mbp) for all Ixodida with a mean of 1281 Mbp (1.31+ / -0.07 pg) for the Argasidae and 2671 Mbp (2.73+ / -0.04 pg) for the Ixodidae. The haploid genome size of Ixodes scapularis was determined to be 2262 Mbp. We observed inter- and intra-familial variation in genome size as well as variation between strains of the same species. We explore the implications of these results for tick genome evolution and tick genomics research. "
negative,"Application of Genomics for Understanding Plant Virus-Insect Vector Interactions and Insect Vector Control. The relationships between plant viruses and their vectors have evolved over the millennia, and yet, studies on viruses began <150 years ago and investigations into the virus and vector interactions even more recently. The advent of next generation sequencing, including rapid genome and transcriptome analysis, methods for evaluation of small RNAs, and the related disciplines of proteomics and metabolomics offer a significant shift in the ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in virus infection and transmission by insect vectors. Genomic technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine the response of insect vectors to the presence of ingested viruses through gene expression changes and altered biochemical pathways. This review focuses on the interactions between viruses and their whitefly or thrips vectors and on potential applications of genomics-driven control of the insect vectors. Recent studies have evaluated gene expression in vectors during feeding on plants infected with begomoviruses, criniviruses, and tospoviruses, which exhibit very different types of virus-vector interactions. These studies demonstrate the advantages of genomics and the potential complementary studies that rapidly advance our understanding of the biology of virus transmission by insect vectors and offer additional opportunities to design novel genetic strategies to manage insect vectors and the viruses they transmit. "
positive,"Evolution of the Torso activation cassette, a pathway required for terminal patterning and moulting. Embryonic terminal patterning and moulting are critical developmental processes in insects. In Drosophila and Tribolium both of these processes are regulated by the Torso-activation cassette (TAC). The TAC consists of a common receptor, Torso, ligands Trunk and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and the spatially restricted protein Torso-like, with combinations of these elements acting mechanistically to activate the receptor in different developmental contexts. In order to trace the evolutionary history of the TAC we determined the presence or absence of TAC components in the genomes of arthropods. Our analyses reveal that Torso, Trunk and PTTH are evolutionarily labile components of the TAC with multiple individual or combined losses occurring in the arthropod lineages leading to and within the insects. These losses are often correlated, with both ligands and receptor missing from the genome of the same species. We determine that the PTTH gene evolved in the common ancestor of Hemiptera and Holometabola, and is missing from the genomes of a number of species with experimentally demonstrated PTTH activity, implying another molecule may be involved in ecdysis in these species. In contrast, the torso-like gene is a common component of pancrustacean genomes. "
negative,"Transfers of mitochondrial DNA to the nuclear genome in the wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Many organisms carry nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs). We have identified 76 NUMTs in 25 genomic locations in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. The total amount of NUMTs in Nasonia is 42 972 bp exceeding over four-fold that found in Tribolium castaneum and almost fifty-fold that found in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Apis mellifera has an even larger number of NUMTs in its genome (over 230 kb). The Nasonia NUMTs were inserted by multiple independent events and frequently involved large fragments spanning multiple mitochondrial genes. Most of the NUMTs are recent transfers that occurred less than one million years ago after the speciation of N. vitripennis. Duplications and rearrangements in the nucleus have also occurred. Data suggest that NUMTs may be more common in hymenoptera than in other insect genomes. "
negative,"An expansion of the genome size dataset for the insect order Hymenoptera, with a first test of parasitism and eusociality as possible constraints. Although the Hymenoptera represent a remarkably diverse and socioeconomically important group that is of considerable interest in genome biology, they remain understudied in terms of genome size. This study reports new genome size estimates for 89 species of ants, bees and wasps, representing 17 families and four superfamilies. These are used in a test of the hypothesis that genome sizes are constrained by traits associated with parasitism or eusociality. Not all parasitoid wasps exhibit small genomes, though a relationship based on specific types of parasitism may still occur; by contrast, there was no convincing evidence of a constraint relating to eusociality. The data provided here can be used to guide future research aimed at understanding the evolution of large-scale genomic properties in this order. "
negative,"Lepidoptera genomes: current knowledge, gaps and future directions. Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the most ecologically diverse and speciose insect orders. With recent advances in genomics, new Lepidoptera genomes are regularly being sequenced, and many of them are playing principal roles in genomics studies, particularly in the fields of phylo-genomics and functional genomics. Thus far, assembled genomes are only available for <10 of the 43 Lepidoptera superfamilies. Nearly all are model species, found in the speciose clade Ditrysia. Community support for Lepidoptera genomics is growing with successful management and dissemination of data and analytical tools in centralized databases. With genomic studies quickly becoming integrated with ecological and evolutionary research, the Lepidoptera community will unquestionably benefit from new high-quality reference genomes that are more evenly distributed throughout the order. "
negative,"Sex loss in insects: causes of asexuality and consequences for genomes. Boasting a staggering diversity of reproductive strategies, insects provide attractive models for the comparative study of the causes and consequences of transitions to asexuality. We provide an overview of some contemporary studies of reproductive systems in insects and compile an initial database of asexual insect genome resources. Insect systems have already yielded some important insights into various mechanisms by which sex is lost, including genetic, endosymbiont-mediated, and hybridization. Studies of mutation and substitution after loss of sex provide the strongest empirical support for hypothesized effects of asexuality, whereas there is mixed evidence for ecological hypotheses such as increased parasite load and altered niche breadth in asexuals. Most hypotheses have been explored in a select few taxa (e.g. stick insects, aphids), such that much of the great taxonomic breadth of insects remain understudied. Given the variation in the proximate causes of asexuality in insects, we argue for expanding the taxonomic breadth of study systems. Despite some challenges for investigating sex in insects, the increasing cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing makes data generation for closely-related asexual and sexual lineages increasingly feasible. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of mutualistic viruses of Glyptapanteles parasitic wasps. BACKGROUND: Polydnaviruses, double-stranded DNA viruses with segmented genomes, have evolved as obligate endosymbionts of parasitoid wasps. Virus particles are replication deficient and produced by female wasps from proviral sequences integrated into the wasp genome. These particles are co-injected with eggs into caterpillar hosts, where viral gene expression facilitates parasitoid survival and, thereby, survival of proviral DNA. Here we characterize and compare the encapsidated viral genome sequences of bracoviruses in the family Polydnaviridae associated with Glyptapanteles gypsy moth parasitoids, along with near complete proviral sequences from which both viral genomes are derived. RESULTS: The encapsidated Glyptapanteles indiensis and Glyptapanteles flavicoxis bracoviral genomes, each composed of 29 different size segments, total approximately 517 and 594 kbp, respectively. They are generated from a minimum of seven distinct loci in the wasp genome. Annotation of these sequences revealed numerous novel features for polydnaviruses, including insect-like sugar transporter genes and transposable elements. Evolutionary analyses suggest that positive selection is widespread among bracoviral genes. CONCLUSIONS: The structure and organization of G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis bracovirus proviral segments as multiple loci containing one to many viral segments, flanked and separated by wasp gene-encoding DNA, is confirmed. Rapid evolution of bracovirus genes supports the hypothesis of bracovirus genes in an 'arms race' between bracovirus and caterpillar. Phylogenetic analyses of the bracoviral genes encoding sugar transporters provides the first robust evidence of a wasp origin for some polydnavirus genes. We hypothesize transposable elements, such as those described here, could facilitate transfer of genes between proviral segments and host DNA. "
negative,"Genomics at the evolving species boundary. Molecular studies on hybridization date back to Dobzhansky who compared chromosomal banding patterns to determine if interspecific gene flow occurred in nature [1]. Now, the advent of high-throughput sequencing provides increasingly fine insights into genomic differentiation between incipient taxa that are changing our view of adaptation and speciation and the links between the two. Empirical data from hybridizing taxa demonstrate highly heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation. Although underlining reasons for this heterogeneity are complex, studies of hybridizing taxa offers some of the best insights into the regions of the genome under divergent selection and the role these regions play in species boundaries. The challenge moving forward is to develop a better theoretical framework that fully leverages these powerful natural experiments. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of insect juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of insect juvenile hormone (JH) and its neuroendocrine control are attractive targets for chemical control of insect pests and vectors of disease. To facilitate the molecular study of JH biosynthesis, we analyzed ESTs from the glands producing JH, the corpora allata (CA) in the cockroach Diploptera punctata, an insect long used as a physiological model species and compared them with ESTs from the CA of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles albimanus. The predicted genes were analyzed according to their probable functions with the Gene Ontology classification, and compared to Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae genes. A large number of reciprocal matches in the cDNA libraries of cockroach and mosquito CA were found. These matches defined known and suspected enzymes of the JH biosynthetic pathway, but also several proteins associated with signal transduction that might play a role in the modulation of JH synthesis by neuropeptides. The identification in both cockroach and mosquito CA of homologs of the small ligand binding proteins from insects, Takeout / JH binding protein and retinol-binding protein highlights a hitherto unsuspected complexity of metabolite trafficking, perhaps JH precursor trafficking, in these endocrine glands. Furthermore, many reciprocal matches for genes of unknown function may provide a fertile ground for an in-depth study of allatal-specific cell physiology. ESTs are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers DV 017592-DV 018447 (Diploptera punctata); DR 746432-DV 747949 (Aedes aegypti); and DR 747950-DR 748310 (Anopheles albimanus). "
negative,"Genomic variations in the 3'-termini of Rice stripe virus in the rotation between vector insect and host plant. A large number of plant RNA viruses circulate between plants and insects. For RNA viruses, host alternations may impose a differential selective pressure on viral populations and induce variations in viral genomes. Here, we report the variations in the 3'-terminal regions of the multiple-segment RNA virus Rice stripe virus (RSV) that were discovered through de novo assembly of the genome using RNA sequencing data from infected host plants and vector insects. The newly assembled RSV genome contained 16- and 15-nt extensions at the 3'-termini of two genome segments compared with the published reference RSV genome. Our study demonstrated that these extensional sequences were consistently observed in two RSV isolates belonging to distinct genetic subtypes in RSV-infected rice, wheat and tobacco. Moreover, the de novo assembled genome of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus also contained 3'-terminal extensions in five RNA segments compared with the reference genome. Time course experiments confirmed that the 3'-terminal extensions of RSV were enriched in the vector insects, were gradually eliminated in the host plant and potentially affected viral replication. These findings indicate that variations in the 3'-termini of viral genomes may be different adaptive strategies for plant RNA viruses in insects and plants. "
negative,"Identification, genomic organization and expression profiles of four heat shock protein genes in the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, is an important invasive pest with a strong tolerance for extreme temperatures; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate thermotolerance in this insect remain unclear. In this study, four heat shock protein genes were cloned from F. occidentalis and named Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60. These four Hsps exhibited typical characteristics of heat shock proteins. Subcellular localization signals and phylogenetic analysis indicated that FoHsp90 and FoHsc701 localize to the cytosol, whereas FoHsc702 and FoHsp60 were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. Analysis of genomic sequences revealed the presence of introns in the four genes (three, four, seven, and five introns for Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60, respectively). Both the number and position of introns in these four genes were quite different from analogous genes in other species. qRT-PCR indicated that the four Fohsps were detected in second-stage larvae, one-day-old pupae, and one-day-old adults, and mRNA expression levels were lowest in larvae and highest in pupae. Fohsc701 and Fohsc702 possessed similar expression patterns and were not induced by cold or heat stress. Expression of Fohsp60 was significantly elevated by heat, and Fohsp90 was rapidly up-regulated after exposure to both cold and heat stress. Exposure to -8°C had no effect on expression of the four Fohsps; however, expression of Fohsp90 and Fohsp60 was highest after a 2-h incubation at 39°C. Furthermore, cold and heat hardening led to significant up-regulation of the four Fohsps compared to their respective controls. Collectively, our results indicate that the four FoHsps contribute to insect development and also function in rapid cold or heat hardening; furthermore, FoHsp90 and FoHsp60 contribute to thermotolerance in F. occidentalis.  "
negative,"A dicistronic gene pair within a cluster of ""EF-hand"" protein genes in the genomes of Drosophila species. Androcam is a Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin-related protein that functions specifically in the testis. We show that the Acam gene is part of a cluster of three intronless genes arranged in a head-to-tail manner. The additional genes also encode calmodulin-related proteins with testis-specific transcription. Acam and the 5'-most gene (gene1) generate monocistronic transcripts. Surprisingly, the central gene (gene2) is transcribed only as a dicistronic transcript with Acam. A similar cluster is found in D. yakuba. In D. pseudoobscura, the cluster contains four genes: two Acam-type genes downstream of a single gene related to both gene1 and gene2 and a fourth weakly related gene. Nevertheless, the D. pseudoobscura cluster also generates a dicistronic transcript from a gene pair analogous to the gene2-Acam pair. A cotranscribed gene1 / 2-Acam gene pair may be the founding feature of this locus. Although Acam protein is present in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura testes, cognate proteins for the gene1 / 2-type ORFs are not detectable by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry techniques. "
positive,"Functional characterization of cis-acting elements mediating flavone-inducible expression of CYP321A1. How plant allelochemicals elicit herbivore counterdefense genes remains largely unknown. To define the cis-acting elements for flavone inducibility of the allelochemical-metabolizing CYP321A1 from Helicoverpa zea, functions of varying length of CYP321A1 promoter are examined in H. zea fatbody cells. Progressive 3' deletions reveal presence of positive elements in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Progressive 5' deletions map out regions of one essential element, four enhancers, and two silencers. Further progressive 5'deletions localize the essential element to a 36-bp region from -109 to -74. This essential element, designated as xenobiotic response element to flavone (XRE-Fla), contains a 5' AT-only TAAT inverted repeat, a GCT mirror repeat and a 3' antioxidant response element-like element. Internal deletions and substitution mutations show that the TAAT repeat is only necessary for the maximal flavone inducibility, whereas the other two components are necessary for the basal and flavone-induced expression of CYP321A1. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that XRE-Fla specifically binds to H. zea fatbody cell nuclear extracts and flavone treatment increases the nuclear concentrations of the yet-to-be characterized transcription factors binding to XRE-Fla. Taken together, CYP321A1 expression is regulated primarily by XRE-Fla and secondarily by other cis elements scattered in its promoter and 5' UTR. "
negative,"Metarhizium alvesii sp. nov.: A new member of the Metarhizium anisopliae species complex. A strain within the Metarhizium anisopliae species complex was isolated in 2009 from a soil sample in a banana plantation in the municipality of Quixeré, Northeastern region of Brazil. Previous studies showed that this insect-pathogenic strain does not fit with any current taxon within the M. anisopliae species complex, as determined by both genomic and by mass spectrometric analyses. In the present study, CG1123 (=ARSEF 13308) is shown to be morphologically indistinguishable from most species in this cosmopolitan species complex, whereas multilocus phylogeny confirmed its uniqueness and supports its recognition as a new species, Metarhizium alvesii, in honor of Sérgio Batista Alves, one of the founders of insect pathology in Brazil. "
negative,"Identification of glutathione S-transferases in Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and evidence that GSTd7 helps explain the difference in insecticide susceptibility between B. tabaci Middle East-Minor Asia 1 and Mediterranean. The Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera:Aleyrodidae) species complex includes invasive and destructive pests of field crops, and the sibling species MEAM1 and MED are its two most damaging members. Previous research indicated that the replacement of Middle East-Minor Asia 1 (MEAM1) by Mediterranean (MED) as the dominant B. tabaci species in China can be mainly attributed to MED's greater tolerance to insecticides. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play important roles in the detoxification of hydrophobic toxic compounds. To increase our understanding of differences in insecticide resistance between B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED, we searched the genomic and transcriptomic databases and identified 23 putative GSTs in both B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED. Through measuring mRNA levels of 18 of the GSTs after B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED adults were exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid, we found that the expression levels were increased more in B. tabaci MED than in MEAM1 (in particular, the expression level of GST-d7 was increased by 4.39-fold relative to the control). Knockdown of GST-d7 in B. tabaci MED but not in B. tabaci MEAM1 resulted in a substantial increase in the mortality of imidacloprid-treated adults. These results indicate that differences in GST-d7 may help explain why insecticide tolerance is greater in B. tabaci MED than in B. tabaci MEAM1. "
negative,"Characterization of the Complete Mitochondrial Genome of Harpalus sinicus and Its Implications for Phylogenetic Analyses. In this study, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of Harpalus sinicus (occasionally named as the Chinese ground beetle) which is the first mitochondrial genome for Harpalus. The mitogenome is 16,521 bp in length, comprising 37 genes, and a control region. The A + T content of the mitogenome is as high as 80.6%. A mitochondrial origins of light-strand replication (OL)-like region is found firstly in the insect mitogenome, which can form a stem-loop hairpin structure. Thirteen protein-coding genes (PCGs) share high homology, and all of them are under purifying selection. All tRNA genes (tRNAs) can be folded into the classic cloverleaf secondary structures except tRNA-Ser (GCU), which lacks a dihydrouridine (DHU) stem. The secondary structure of two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) is predicted based on previous insect models. Twelve types of tandem repeats and two stem-loop structures are detected in the control region, and two stem-loop structures may be involved in the initiation of replication and transcription. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses based on mitogenomes suggest that Harpalus is an independent lineage in Carabidae, and is closely related to four genera (Abax, Amara, Stomis, and Pterostichus). In general, this study provides meaningful genetic information for Harpalus sinicus and new insights into the phylogenetic relationships within the Carabidae. "
negative,"Complete Genome of Bacillus thuringiensis Myophage BigBertha. BigBertha is a myophage of Bacillus thuringiensis, a widely used biocontrol agent that is active against many insect pests of plants. Here, we present the complete annotated genome of BigBertha. The genome shares 85.9% sequence identity with Bacillus cereus phage B4.  "
negative,"Genome-wide transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of bollworm-infested developing cotton bolls revealed the genes and pathways involved in the insect pest defence mechanism. Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a major insect pest that feeds on cotton bolls causing extensive damage leading to crop and productivity loss. In spite of such a major impact, cotton plant response to bollworm infection is yet to be witnessed. In this context, we have studied the genome-wide response of cotton bolls infested with bollworm using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Further, we have validated this data using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. Comparative analyses have revealed that 39% of the transcriptome and 35% of the proteome were differentially regulated during bollworm infestation. Around 36% of significantly regulated transcripts and 45% of differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in signalling followed by redox regulation. Further analysis showed that defence-related stress hormones and their lipid precursors, transcription factors, signalling molecules, etc. were stimulated, whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed during bollworm infestation. Around 26% of the significantly up-regulated proteins were defence molecules, while >50% of the significantly down-regulated were related to photosynthesis and growth. Interestingly, the biosynthesis genes for synergistically regulated jasmonate, ethylene and suppressors of the antagonistic factor salicylate were found to be up-regulated, suggesting a choice among stress-responsive phytohormone regulation. Manual curation of the enzymes and TFs highlighted the components of retrograde signalling pathways. Our data suggest that a selective regulatory mechanism directs the reallocation of metabolic resources favouring defence over growth under bollworm infestation and these insights could be exploited to develop bollworm-resistant cotton varieties. "
positive,"The midgut V-ATPase subunit A gene is associated with toxicity to crystal 2Aa and crystal 1Ca-expressing transgenic rice in Chilo suppressalis. Insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are toxic to a diverse range of insects. Transgenic rice expressing Cry1A, Cry2A and Cry1C toxins have been developed that are lethal to Chilo suppressalis, a devastating insect pest of rice in China. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the interactions of Cry toxins with susceptible hosts will improve both our understanding of Cry protein toxicology and long-term efficacy of Bt crops. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that V-ATPase subunit A contributes to the action of Cry1Ab / 1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxins in C. suppressalis. The full-length V-ATPase subunit A transcript was initially cloned from the C. suppressalis larval midgut and then used to generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-producing bacteria. Toxicity assays using transgenic rice lines TT51 (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac fusion genes), T2A-1 (Cry2Aa), and T1C-19 (Cry1Ca) in conjunction with V-ATPase subunit A dsRNA-treated C. suppressalis larvae revealed significantly reduced larval susceptibility to T2A-1 and T1C-19 transgenic rice, but not to TT51 rice. These results suggest that the V-ATPase subunit A plays a crucial role in mediating Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxicity in C. suppressalis. These findings will have significant implications on the development of future resistance management tools. "
negative,"RNAi technology: a new platform for crop pest control. The insect pests are big threat in meeting the food demands for future generation. The present pest control strategies, including the existing transgenic approaches show certain limitations and are not completely successful in limiting the insect pests. However, the sequence-specific gene silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) holds a great promise for effective management of agricultural pests. RNAi is naturally occurring conserved process responsible for gene regulation and defense against pathogens. The efficacy of RNAi varies among different insect orders and also depends upon various factors, including the target gene selection, method of dsRNAs delivery, expression of dsRNAs and presence of off-target effects. RNAi-mediated silencing of different insect genes involved in various physiological processes was found to be detrimental to insects growth, development and survival. In this article, we have reviewed the potential of RNAi-based strategies for effective management of insect pests. We have also discussed the various parameters, which are to be considered for host-induced RNAi-mediated control of insect pests without producing any effect on non-target organisms and environment. "
negative,"Transcriptome Analysis and Screening for Potential Target Genes for RNAi-Mediated Pest Control of the Beet Armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), is a serious pest worldwide that causes significant losses in crops. Unfortunately, genetic resources for the beet armyworm is extremely scarce. To improve these resources we sequenced the transcriptome of S. exigua representing all stages including eggs, 1(st) to 5(th) instar larvae, pupae, male and female adults using the Illumina Solexa platform. We assembled the transcriptome with Trinity that yielded 31,414 contigs. Of these contigs, 18,592 were annotated as protein coding genes by Blast searches against the NCBI nr database. It has been shown that knockdown of important insect genes by dsRNAs or siRNAs is a feasible mechanism to control insect pests. The first key step towards developing an efficient RNAi-mediated pest control technique is to find suitable target genes. To screen for effective target genes in the beet armyworm, we selected nine candidate genes. The sequences of these genes were amplified using the RACE strategy. Then, siRNAs were designed and chemically synthesized. We injected 2 µl siRNA (2 µg / µl) into the 4(th) instar larvae to knock down the respective target genes. The mRNA abundance of target genes decreased to different levels (∼20-94.3%) after injection of siRNAs. Knockdown of eight genes including chitinase7, PGCP, chitinase1, ATPase, tubulin1, arf2, tubulin2 and arf1 caused a significantly high level of mortality compared to the negative control (P<0.05). About 80% of the surviving insects in the siRNA-treated group of five genes (PGCP, chitinase1, tubulin1, tubulin2 and helicase) showed retarded development. In chitinase1-siRNA and chitinase7-siRNA administered groups, 12.5% survivors exhibited ""half-ecdysis"". In arf1-siRNA and arf2-siRNA groups, the body color of 15% became black 48 h after injections. In summary, the transcriptome could be a valuable genetic resource for identification of genes in S. exigua and this study provided putative targets for RNAi pest control. "
negative,"Mechanisms and dynamics of orphan gene emergence in insect genomes. Orphan genes are defined as genes that lack detectable similarity to genes in other species and therefore no clear signals of common descent (i.e., homology) can be inferred. Orphans are an enigmatic portion of the genome because their origin and function are mostly unknown and they typically make up 10% to 30% of all genes in a genome. Several case studies demonstrated that orphans can contribute to lineage-specific adaptation. Here, we study orphan genes by comparing 30 arthropod genomes, focusing in particular on seven recently sequenced ant genomes. This setup allows analyzing a major metazoan taxon and a comparison between social Hymenoptera (ants and bees) and nonsocial Diptera (flies and mosquitoes). First, we find that recently split lineages undergo accelerated genomic reorganization, including the rapid gain of many orphan genes. Second, between the two insect orders Hymenoptera and Diptera, orphan genes are more abundant and emerge more rapidly in Hymenoptera, in particular, in leaf-cutter ants. With respect to intragenomic localization, we find that ant orphan genes show little clustering, which suggests that orphan genes in ants are scattered uniformly over the genome and between nonorphan genes. Finally, our results indicate that the genetic mechanisms creating orphan genes-such as gene duplication, frame-shift fixation, creation of overlapping genes, horizontal gene transfer, and exaptation of transposable elements-act at different rates in insects, primates, and plants. In Formicidae, the majority of orphan genes has their origin in intergenic regions, pointing to a high rate of de novo gene formation or generalized gene loss, and support a recently proposed dynamic model of frequent gene birth and death. "
negative,"Development of bacterial artificial chromosome library resources for parasitoid Hymenoptera (Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti: Pteromalidae). The species of the genus Nasonia possess qualities that make them excellent candidates for genetic and genomic studies. To increase the wealth of genomic resources for the genus we constructed publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti. Libraries have 36 864 clones each, empty-vector contents of approximately 2% and average insert sizes of 113.1 and 97.7 Kb, respectively, representing 12 and 11 genome equivalents. The N. vitripennis library was used for genome sequence assembly and in efforts at positional cloning of a developmental gene. The genome assembly of N. vitripennis is currently composed on 6181 un-joined scaffolds. These BAC libraries can be used to identify and close regions between scaffolds of the genome assemblies of both species. "
negative,Amplification of complete insect mitochondrial genome in two easy pieces. The entire insect mitochondrial genome has been amplified in just two PCR reactions. 'Universal' insect primers and techniques to optimize amplification of long PCR products were used to obtain segments of the mitochondrial genomes of Helicoverpa zea and Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera) ranging in size from 3.7 kb to 14 kb or about 25% to over 85% of a typical 16 kb mtDNA. Overlapping pairs of fragments contain the complete mtDNA sequence. 
positive,"Anopheles stephensi Dox-A2 shares common ancestry with genes from distant groups of eukaryotes encoding a 26S proteasome subunit and is in a conserved gene cluster. The sequence of a cloned Anopheles stephensi gene showed 72% inferred amino acid identity with Drosophila melanogaster Dox-A2 and 93% with its putative ortholog in Anopheles gambiae. Dox-A2 is the reported but herein disputed structural locus for diphenol oxidase A2. Database searches identified Dox-A2 related gene sequences from 15 non-insect species from diverse groups. Phylogenetic trees based on alignments of inferred protein sequences, DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are orthologous. The only inconsistency was that the C-terminus appears to be more primitive in the yeasts than in plants. In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable. A plausible additional role, in which the 26S proteasome is implicated in regulation of phenol oxidase, would also apply to at least the mammalian genes. No function has yet been reported for the other included sequences. These were from genome projects and included Caenorhabiditus elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Fugu rubripes, and Toxoplasma gondii. A consensus of the results predicts a protein containing exceptionally long stretches of helix with a hydrophilic C-terminus. Phosphorylation site motifs were identified at two conserved positions. Possible SRY and GATA-1 binding motifs were found at conserved positions upstream of the mosquito genes. The location of A. stephensi Dox-A2 was determined by in situ hybridization at 34D on chromosome arm 3R. It is in a conserved gene cluster with respect to the other insects. However, the A. stephensi cluster contains a gene showing significant sequence identity to human and pigeon carnitine acetyltransferase genes, therefore showing divergence with the distal end of the D. melanogaster cluster. "
negative,"Estimation of the Whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genome Size Based on k-mer and Flow Cytometric Analyses. Whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) cryptic species complex are among the most important agricultural insect pests in the world. These phloem-feeding insects can colonize over 1000 species of plants worldwide and inflict severe economic losses to crops, mainly through the transmission of pathogenic viruses. Surprisingly, there is very little genomic information about whiteflies. As a starting point to genome sequencing, we report a new estimation of the genome size of the B. tabaci B biotype or Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) population. Using an isogenic whitefly colony with over 6500 haploid male individuals for genomic DNA, three paired-end genomic libraries with insert sizes of ~300 bp, 500 bp and 1 Kb were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. A total of ~50 billion base pairs of sequences were obtained from each library. K-mer analysis using these sequences revealed that the genome size of the whitefly was ~682.3 Mb. In addition, the flow cytometric analysis estimated the haploid genome size of the whitefly to be ~690 Mb. Considering the congruency between both estimation methods, we predict the haploid genome size of B. tabaci MEAM1 to be ~680-690 Mb. Our data provide a baseline for ongoing efforts to assemble and annotate the B. tabaci genome.  "
positive,"RNA interference of timeless gene does not disrupt circadian locomotor rhythms in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Molecular studies revealed that autoregulatory negative feedback loops consisting of so-called ""clock genes"" constitute the circadian clock in Drosophila. However, this hypothesis is not fully supported in other insects and is thus to be examined. In the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we have previously shown that period (per) plays an essential role in the rhythm generation. In the present study, we cloned cDNA of the clock gene timeless (tim) and investigated its role in the cricket circadian oscillatory mechanism using RNA interference. Molecular structure of the cricket tim has rather high similarity to those of other insect species. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that tim mRNA showed rhythmic expression in both LD and DD similar to that of per, peaking during the (subjective) night. When injected with tim double-stranded RNA (dstim), tim mRNA levels were significantly reduced and its circadian expression rhythm was eliminated. After the dstim treatment, however, adult crickets showed a clear locomotor rhythm in DD, with a free-running period significantly shorter than that of control crickets injected with Discosoma sp. Red2 (DsRed2) dsRNA. These results suggest that in the cricket, tim plays some role in fine-tuning of the free-running period but may not be essential for oscillation of the circadian clock. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of transcriptomic divergence between laboratory colony and field Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes of the M and S molecular forms. Our knowledge of Anopheles gambiae molecular biology has mainly been based on studies using inbred laboratory strains. Differences in the environmental exposure of these and natural field mosquitoes have inevitably led to physiological divergences. We have used global transcript abundance analyses to probe into this divergence, and identified transcript abundance patterns of genes that provide insight on specific adaptations of caged and field mosquitoes. We also compared the gene transcript abundance profiles of field mosquitoes belonging to the two morphologically indistinguishable but reproductively isolated sympatric molecular forms, M and S, from two different locations in the Yaoundé area of Cameroon. This analysis suggested that environmental exposure has a greater influence on the transcriptome than does the mosquito's molecular form-specific genetic background. "
negative,"Molecular Characterization of the 2016 New World Screwworm (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Outbreak in the Florida Keys. New World screwworm (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel 1858) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), is a myiasis-causing fly that can be a serious threat to the health of livestock, wildlife, and humans. Its progressive eradication from the southern United States, Mexico, and Central America from the 1950s to 2000s is an excellent example of successful pest management using sterile insect technique (SIT). In late 2016, autochthonous NWS were detected in the Florida Keys, representing this species' first invasion in the United States in >30 yr. Rapid use of quarantine and SIT was successful in eliminating the infestation by early 2017; however, the geographic source of this infestation remains unknown. Here, we use amplicon sequencing to generate mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data representing all confirmed cases of NWS from this infestation, and compare these sequences to preexisting data sets sampling the native distribution of NWS. We ask two questions regarding the FL Keys outbreak. First, is this infestation the result of a single invasion from one source, or multiple invasions from different sources? And second, what is the geographic origin of this invasion? We found virtually no sequence variation between specimens collected from the FL Keys outbreak, which is consistent with a single source of introduction. However, we also found very little geographic resolution in any of the data sets, which precludes identification of the source of this outbreak. Our lack of success in answering our second question speaks to the need for finer-scale genetic or genomic assessments of NWS population structure, which would facilitate source determination of potential future outbreaks.

positive,"Targeting the potassium ion channel genes SK and SH as a novel approach for control of insect pests: efficacy and biosafety. BACKGROUND: Potassium ion channels play a critical role in the generation of electrical signals and thus provide potential targets for control of insect pests by RNA interference. RESULTS: Genes encoding the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) and the voltage-gated potassium channel (SH) were knocked down in Tribolium castaneum by injection and oral delivery of dsRNA (dsTcSK and dsTcSH, respectively). Irrespective of the delivery mechanism a dose-dependent effect was observed for knockdown (KD) of gene expression and insect mortality for both genes. Larvae fed a 400 ng dsRNA mg-1 diet showed significant gene (P < 0.05) knockdown (98% and 83%) for SK and SH, respectively, with corresponding mortalities of 100% and 98% after 7 days. When injected (248.4 ng larva-1 ), gene KD was 99% and 98% for SK and SH, causing 100% and 73.4% mortality, respectively. All developmental stages tested (larvae, early- and late-stage pupae and adults) showed an RNAi-sensitive response for both genes. LC50 values were lower for SK than SH, irrespective of delivery method, demonstrating that the knockdown of SK had a greater effect on larval mortality. Biosafety studies using adult honeybee Apis mellifera showed that there were no significant differences either in expression levels or mortality of honeybees orally dosed with dsTcSK and dsTcSH compared to control-fed bees. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the titre of deformed wing virus, used as a measure of immune suppression, between experimental and control bees. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of using RNAi targeting neural receptors as a technology for the control of T. castaneum. © 2019 The Authors.

negative,"Characterization of burdock mottle virus, a novel member of the genus Benyvirus, and the identification of benyvirus-related sequences in the plant and insect genomes. The complete nucleotide sequence of the burdock mottle virus (BdMoV) isolated from an edible burdock plant (Arctium lappa) in Japan has been determined. BdMoV has a bipartite genome, whose organization is similar to RNA1 and RNA2 of benyviruses, beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), beet soil-borne mosaic virus (BSBMV), and rice stripe necrosis virus (RSNV). BdMoV RNA1 (7038 nt) contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 249-kDa polypeptide that consists of methyl-transferase, helicase, papain-like protease, AlkB-like, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains. The AlkB-like domain sequence is not present in the proteins encoded by other known benyviruses, but is found in replication-associated proteins of viruses mainly belonging to the families Alfaflexiviridae and Betaflexiviridae. BdMoV RNA2 (4315 nt) contains six ORFs that are similar to those of benyviruses: these are coat protein (CP), CP readthrough, triple gene block movement and cysteine-rich proteins. Phylogenetic analyses showed that BdMoV is more closely related to BNYVV and BSBMV than to RSNV. Database searches showed that benyvirus replicase-related sequences are present in the chromosomes of a chickpea plant (Cicer arietinum) and a blood-sucking insect (Rhodnius prolixus). Some other benyvirus-related sequences are found in the transcriptome shotgun libraries of a few species of plants and a bark beetle. Our results show that BdMoV is a distinct species of the genus Benyvirus and that ancestral and extant benyviruses may have infected or currently infect a wide range of hosts, including plants and insects. "
negative,"Fungal proteomics: from identification to function. Some fungi cause disease in humans and plants, while others have demonstrable potential for the control of insect pests. In addition, fungi are also a rich reservoir of therapeutic metabolites and industrially useful enzymes. Detailed analysis of fungal biochemistry is now enabled by multiple technologies including protein mass spectrometry, genome and transcriptome sequencing and advances in bioinformatics. Yet, the assignment of function to fungal proteins, encoded either by in silico annotated, or unannotated genes, remains problematic. The purpose of this review is to describe the strategies used by many researchers to reveal protein function in fungi, and more importantly, to consolidate the nomenclature of 'unknown function protein' as opposed to 'hypothetical protein' - once any protein has been identified by protein mass spectrometry. A combination of approaches including comparative proteomics, pathogen-induced protein expression and immunoproteomics are outlined, which, when used in combination with a variety of other techniques (e.g. functional genomics, microarray analysis, immunochemical and infection model systems), appear to yield comprehensive and definitive information on protein function in fungi. The relative advantages of proteomic, as opposed to transcriptomic-only, analyses are also described. In the future, combined high-throughput, quantitative proteomics, allied to transcriptomic sequencing, are set to reveal much about protein function in fungi. "
positive,"Expression and characterization of a recombinant i-type lysozyme from the harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis. Lysozymes are enzymes that destroy bacterial cell walls by hydrolysing the polysaccharide component of peptidoglycan. In insects, there are two classes of lysozymes, the c-type with muramidase activity and the i-type whose prototypical members from annelids and molluscs possess both muramidase and isopeptidase activities. Many insect genes encoding c-type and i-type lysozymes have been identified during genome and transcriptome analyses, but only c-type lysozymes have been functionally characterized at the protein level. Here we produced one of five i-type lysozymes represented in the immunity-related transcriptome of the invasive harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis as recombinant protein. This was the only one containing the serine and histidine residues that are thought to be required for isopeptidase activity. This i-type lysozyme was recombinantly expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, but the purified protein was inactive in both muramidase and isopeptidase assays. Transcription and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that this i-type lysozyme is produced in the fat body but is not inducible by immune challenge. These data suggest that i-type lysozymes in insects may have acquired novel and as yet undetermined functions in the course of evolution. "
negative,"Evolutionary genetics in insect phenotypic radiations: the value of a comparative genomic approach. Expanding genome sequencing and transgenic technologies are enabling the discovery of genes driving phenotypic diversity across insect taxa. Limitations in downstream functional genetic approaches, however, have been an obstacle for developing non-model systems for evolutionary genetics. Phenotypically diverse radiations, such as those exhibiting convergence and divergence as a result of mimicry, are ideal for evolutionary genetics as they can lead to insights using comparative genomic approaches alone. The varied and repeated instances of phenotypes in highly polymorphic systems allow assessment of whether similar loci are repeatedly targeted by selection and can inform how alleles sort across lineages. Comparative genomics of these taxa can be used to decipher components of gene regulatory networks, dissect regulatory regions, and validate genes. "
negative,"Identification of a tubulin-α gene specifically expressed in testis and adductor muscle during stable reference gene selection in the hermaphrodite gonad of the lion's paw scallop Nodipecten subnodosus. For non-model species, as many used for aquaculture, with minimal or no genomic information, relative quantification of gene expression studies requires preliminary research including the isolation of potential reference genes and the identification of those stably expressed under the biological conditions of interest. Here we report on the isolation of five partial gene sequences from gonad tissue cDNA in the functional hermaphrodite scallop Nodipecten subnodosus to be evaluated as reference genes: 18S-rRNA, riboprotein l8 (rp-l8), actin-β (act-β), elongation factor 1α (ef-1α) and alpha-tubulin-α (tub-α). We found that 18S-rRNA was stably expressed independently of the priming method used to reverse transcribe RNA to cDNA, oligo-dT or random hexamer. Stability analysis for the five putative reference genes with geNorm and NormFinder indicated that 18S together with rp-l8 were the most stable genes for normalization of gene expression during gonad development in both, male and female sexual regions of the hermaphrodite N. subnodosus. The least stable gene was tub-α, showing a biased expression profile between sexual regions of the gonad, therefore this gene was analyzed thereafter as a target gene together with vitellogenin (vit) and a DEAD-box RNA helicase (dbx) gene. Relative expression, estimated by normalization with the combination of 18S and rp-l8 as reference genes, indicated that as gonad development advanced two of the target genes were up-regulated, tub-α in the male region and vit in the female region. Whereas an increased expression was expected during development for vit for its known role in vitellogenesis, the increased expression of tub-α in the male sexual region was unexpected, and pointed toward this gene being a testis-specific α-tubulin isotype. Further analyses of gene expression among tissues indicated that tub-α is specifically and highly expressed in the male gonad, although expression in adductor muscle was also observed at significantly lower levels. The existence of testis specific α- and β-tubulins has been previously reported in other taxa, relating their function to sperm axoneme formation. Tissue-specific tubulin genes, particularly their promoters, have recently found an application as native promoters for transgene tissue-specific expression in research and reproductive control of insect plagues. The third target gene, a putative member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family (dbx), showed no changes in expression during gonad development or between sexual regions, therefore it was chosen to discuss the different statistical inferences resulting from the arbitrary use of 'randomly chosen' reference genes when normalizing gene expression. "
negative,"Genome analysis and genetic enhancement of tomato. The Solanaceae is an important family of vegetable crops, ornamentals and medicinal plants. Tomato has served as a model member of this family largely because of its enriched cytogenetic, genetic, as well as physical, maps. Mapping has helped in cloning several genes of importance such as Pto, responsible for resistance against bacterial speck disease, Mi-1.2 for resistance against nematodes, and fw2.2 QTL for fruit weight. A high-throughput genome-sequencing program has been initiated by an international consortium of 10 countries. Since heterochromatin has been found to be concentrated near centromeres, the consortium is focusing on sequencing only the gene-rich euchromatic region. Genomes of the members of Solanaceae show a significant degree of synteny, suggesting that the tomato genome sequence would help in the cloning of genes for important traits from other Solanaceae members as well. ESTs from a large number of cDNA libraries have been sequenced, and microarray chips, in conjunction with wide array of ripening mutants, have contributed immensely to the understanding of the fruit-ripening phenomenon. Work on the analysis of the tomato proteome has also been initiated. Transgenic tomato plants with improved abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance and insect resistance, have been developed. Attempts have also been made to develop tomato as a bioreactor for various pharmaceutical proteins. However, control of fruit quality and ripening remains an active and challenging area of research. Such efforts should pave the way to improve not only tomato, but also other solanaceous crops. "
negative,"A novel homeobox cluster expressed in repeated structures of the midgut. A gene cluster (LOX3-C) containing three duplicated homeobox sequences (Lox3A, Lox3B, and Lox3C) was characterized in the leech Hirudo medicinalis. The leech homeoboxes have a limited homology to those of Antennapedia-class genes, but do not have homologs among currently characterized insect genes. The Lox3 genes belong to a new family, named Xlox, that also includes genes from mouse, rat, frog, and a distantly related leech, Helobdella triserialis. All members of the Xlox family are expressed in specific regions of the embryonic gut, where they seem to affect morphogenesis and cell differentiation. The three homeoboxes of LOX3-C described here are contained within nearly identical direct tandem repeats. The LOX3-C region produces at least two transcripts, one present in both embryos and adults and the other only in early embryos. Early Lox3 expression is restricted to specific regions of the midgut primordium, in 12 segmentally repeated, transverse stripes of fusiform cells found at the positions where the midgut will constrict to form the 11 diverticula of the crop. A role in the development of segmentally iterated structures in an initially homogeneous midgut is proposed for LOX3-C. "
positive,"Heat shock proteins contribute to mosquito dehydration tolerance. This study examines the responses of heat shock protein transcripts, Hsp70 and Hsp90, to dehydration stress in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens. We first defined the water balance attributes of adult females of each species, monitored expression of the hsp transcripts in response to dehydration, and then knocked down expression of the transcripts using RNA interference (RNAi) to evaluate potential functions of the Hsps in maintenance of water balance. Fully hydrated females of all three species contained nearly the same amount of water (66-68%), but water loss rates differed among the species, with A. aegypti having the lowest water loss rate (2.6% / h), followed by C. pipiens (3.3% / h), and A. gambiae (5.1% / h). In all three species water could be replaced only by drinking water (or blood). Both A. aegypti and C. pipiens tolerated a loss of 36% of their body water, but A. gambiae was more vulnerable to water loss, tolerating a loss of only 29% of its body water. Dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in all three species, but only C. pipiens continued to express this transcript during rehydration. Hsp90 was constitutively expressed and expression levels remained fairly constant during dehydration and rehydration, except expression was not noted during rehydration of C. pipiens. Injection of dsRNA to knock down expression of hsp70 (83% reduction) and hsp90 (46% reduction) in A. aegypti did not alter water content or water loss rates, but the dehydration tolerance was lower. Instead of surviving a 36% water loss, females were able to survive only a 28% water loss in response to RNAi directed against hsp70 and a 26% water loss when RNAi was directed against hsp90. These results indicate a critical function for these Hsps in mosquito dehydration tolerance. "
negative,"Mining insect genomes for functionally affiliated genes. Several hundred insect genome assemblies are already publicly available, and this total grows on a weekly basis. A major challenge now confronting insect science is how best to use genomic data to improve our understanding of insect biology. We consider a framework for genome analysis based on functional affiliation, that is, groups of genes involved in the same biological process or pathway, and explore how such an approach furthers our understanding of several aspects of insect phenotype. We anticipate that this approach will prove useful for future research across the breadth of insect studies, whatever organism or trait it involves. "
negative,"The functions of caspase in whitefly Bemisia tabaci apoptosis in response to ultraviolet irradiation. Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) are phloem feeders, and some invasive species are composed of cryptic species complexes that cause extensive crop damage, particularly via the direct transmission of plant viruses. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death essential for organismal development and tissue homeostasis. The caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in the initiation of apoptosis in many organisms. Here, we employed a comprehensive genomics approach to identity caspases in B. tabaci Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1), an invasive whitefly that carries a cryptic species complex that is devastating to crops. Four caspase genes were identified, and their motif compositions were predicted. Structures were relatively conserved in both putative effector and initiator caspases. Expression patterns of caspase genes differed across insect developmental stages. Three caspase genes were induced immediately after ultraviolet (UV) treatment. Expression levels of Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b increased in the midgut and salivary glands during apoptosis induced by UV treatments, whereas silencing of both genes reduced UV-triggered apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b, respectively, act as putative initiator and effector apoptotic caspases in the MEAM1 whitefly. "
negative,"Open access genomic resources for terrestrial arthropods. Genome sequencing initiatives like the Arthropod i5k project and other biodiversity genomics research rely on access to high quality DNA and / or tissue. Global collection initiatives such as the Smithsonian Global Genome Initiative (GGI) and its partner network, the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) aim to provide access to these resources at high-quality standards. Here, we review progress toward providing genomic resources (tissues, DNA, genomes) for terrestrial arthropods, a megadiverse animal group, and compare progress in genome sequencing to all other animals. "
negative,"RNA Interference based Approach to Down Regulate Osmoregulators of Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci): Potential Technology for the Control of Whitefly. Over the past decade RNA interference (RNAi) technology has emerged as a successful tool not only for functional genomics, but in planta expression of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that could offer great potential for insect pest management. The diet of insects feeding exclusively on phloem sieves contains water and sugars as main components, and the uptake of the liquid food greatly depends on the osmotic pressure within the insect body. Based on this physiological mechanism, transgenic plants of Nicotiana tabacum were generated expressing double stranded RNA (dsRNA) against both aquaporin (AQP) and a sucrase gene, alpha glucosidase (AGLU). These two genes are involved in osmotic pressure maintenance particularly in sap sucking insects, and the aim was to disrupt osmoregulation within the insect ultimately leading to mortality. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to assess the suppression of gene expression in Bemisia tabaci (B. tabaci) and mortality was recorded during transgenic tobacco feeding bioassays. Feeding of insects on plants expressing dsRNA significantly reduced the transcript level of the target genes in B. tabaci after six days of feeding and more than 70% mortality was observed in B. tabaci fed on transgenic plants compared to the control plants. Our data shows that down-regulation of genes related to osmoregulation may find practical applications for the control of this important pest in cotton and other crops. "
negative,"Rescue of a plant cytorhabdovirus as versatile expression platforms for planthopper and cereal genomic studies. Plant viruses have been used as rapid and cost-effective expression vectors for heterologous protein expression in genomic studies. However, delivering large or multiple foreign proteins in monocots and insect pests is challenging. Here, we recovered a recombinant plant cytorhabdovirus, Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV), for use as a versatile expression platform in cereals and the small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus) insect vector. We engineered BYSMV vectors to provide versatile expression platforms for simultaneous expression of three foreign proteins in barley plants and SBPHs. Moreover, BYSMV vectors could express the c. 600-amino-acid β-glucuronidase (GUS) protein and a red fluorescent protein stably in systemically infected leaves and roots of cereals, including wheat, barley, foxtail millet, and maize plants. Moreover, we have demonstrated that BYSMV vectors can be used in barley to analyze biological functions of gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis genes. In a major technical advance, BYSMV vectors were developed for simultaneous delivery of CRISPR / Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNAs for genomic editing in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Taken together, our results provide considerable potential for rapid screening of functional proteins in cereals and planthoppers, and an efficient approach for developing other insect-transmitted negative-strand RNA viruses. "
negative,"Structure of the Bombyx sorbitol dehydrogenase gene: a possible alternative use of the promoter. In an initial effort to understand the molecular mechanism of how low temperature induces sorbitol dehydrogenase gene expression in diapause eggs of the silkworm, the sorbitol dehydrogenase gene was isolated from a Bombyx genomic library using a cDNA encoding the Bombyx homologue of mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase as a probe. The gene extended for about 10 kb, consisting of eight exons and seven introns. Four TATA motifs were found in the 5' upstream region of the gene, without CCAAT. AATTAA, instead of AATAAA, was localized in the upstream region of the polyadenylation site. Although a single copy of this gene was present per haploid genome, 1.2 kb and 1.1 kb transcripts were found from yolk cells in diapause eggs and from larval fat-body cells, respectively. The two major transcription initiation sites corresponding to both transcripts were localized at 355 and 226 base pairs upstream from the transition start site, indicating an alternative use of promoter. The 5'-upstream region of the gene contained a consensus sequence, TGA(A / T)AA(A / G / T), that has been found in insect genes expressed mainly in larval and pupal fat bodies. It also contained three kinds of sequences similar to cis-elements recognized by members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) / Drosophila Seven up (SVP), Drosophila hormone receptor 39 (DHR39) and Bombyx fushi tarazu transcriptional factor 1 (BmFTZ-F1). "
negative,"Functional annotation of the Ophiostoma novo-ulmi genome: insights into the phytopathogenicity of the fungal agent of Dutch elm disease. The ascomycete fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi is responsible for the pandemic of Dutch elm disease that has been ravaging Europe and North America for 50 years. We proceeded to annotate the genome of the O. novo-ulmi strain H327 that was sequenced in 2012. The 31.784-Mb nuclear genome (50.1% GC) is organized into 8 chromosomes containing a total of 8,640 protein-coding genes that we validated with RNA sequencing analysis. Approximately 53% of these genes have their closest match to Grosmannia clavigera kw1407, followed by 36% in other close Sordariomycetes, 5% in other Pezizomycotina, and surprisingly few (5%) orphans. A relatively small portion (∼3.4%) of the genome is occupied by repeat sequences; however, the mechanism of repeat-induced point mutation appears active in this genome. Approximately 76% of the proteins could be assigned functions using Gene Ontology analysis; we identified 311 carbohydrate-active enzymes, 48 cytochrome P450s, and 1,731 proteins potentially involved in pathogen-host interaction, along with 7 clusters of fungal secondary metabolites. Complementary mating-type locus sequencing, mating tests, and culturing in the presence of elm terpenes were conducted. Our analysis identified a specific genetic arsenal impacting the sexual and vegetative growth, phytopathogenicity, and signaling / plant-defense-degradation relationship between O. novo-ulmi and its elm host and insect vectors. "
negative,"Identification, genomic organization and expression pattern of glutathione S-transferase in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a multifunctional supergene family and some play an important role in insecticide resistance. We have identified 23 putative cytosolic GSTs by searching the new assembly of the Bombyx mori genome sequence. Phylogenetic analyses on the amino acid sequences reveal that 21 of the B. mori GSTs fall into six classes represented in other insects, the other two being unclassified. The majority of the silkworm GSTs belong to the Delta, Epsilon, and Omega classes. Most members of each class are tandemly arranged in the genome, except for the Epsilon GSTs. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to 19 of the 23 GSTs were found in available databases. Furthermore RT-PCR experiments detected expression of all the GSTs in multiple tissues on day 3 of fifth instar larvae. Surprisingly, we found little or no expression of most Delta and Epsilon GSTs in the fat body, which is thought to be the main detoxification organ. This may explain the sensitivity of the silkworm to certain insecticides. Our data provide some insights into the evolution of the B. mori GST family and the functions of individual GST enzymes. "
positive,"Suppression of Gene Juvenile Hormone Diol Kinase Delays Pupation in Heortia vitessoides Moore. Juvenile hormone diol kinase (JHDK) is a critical enzyme involved in juvenile hormone degradation in insects. In this study, HvJHDK in the Heortia vitessoides Moore (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) transcriptional library was cloned. Stage-specific expression patterns of HvJHDK, HvJHEH, and HvJHE as well as juvenile hormone titers were determined. The three tested enzymes participated in juvenile hormone degradation. Moreover, juvenile hormone titers peaked after larval-larval molts, consistent with a role for juvenile hormone in inhibition of metamorphosis. HvJHDK was subsequently suppressed using RNA interference (RNAi) to reveal its functions. Different concentrations of dsJHDK elicited the optimal interference efficiency at different life stages of H. vitessoides. Suppression of HvJHDK decreased HvJHDK content and increased the juvenile hormone titer, thereby resulting in reduced triglyceride content, sharply declined survival rate, clearly lethal phenotypes, and extended larval growth. Moreover, suppression of HvJHDK upregulated HvJHEH and HvJHE expression levels, suggesting that there is feedback regulation in the juvenile hormone metabolic pathway. Taken together, our findings provide molecular references for the selection of novel insecticidal targets. "
positive,"Genome-Wide Screening and Functional Analysis Reveal That the Specific microRNA nlu-miR-173 Regulates Molting by Targeting Ftz-F1 in Nilaparvata lugens. Background: Molting is a crucial physiological behavior during arthropod growth. In the past few years, molting as well as chitin biosynthesis triggered by molting, is subject to regulation by miRNAs. However, how many miRNAs are involved in insect molting at the genome-wide level remains unknown. Results: We deeply sequenced four samples obtained from nymphs at the 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th instars, and then identified 61 miRNAs conserved in the Arthropoda and 326 putative novel miRNAs in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a fearful pest of rice. A total of 36 mature miRNAs with significant different expression levels at the genome scale during molting, including 19 conserved and 17 putative novel miRNAs were identified. After comparing the expression profiles, we found that most of the targets of 36 miRNAs showing significantly differential expression were involved in energy and hormone pathways. One of the 17 putative novel miRNAs, nlu-miR-173 was chosen for functional study. nlu-miR-173 acts in 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling through its direct target, N. lugens Ftz-F1(NlFtz-F1), a transcription factor. Furthermore, we found that the transcription of nlu-miR-173 was promoted by Broad-Complex (BR-C), suggesting that its involvement in the 20-hydroxyecdysone pathway contributes to proper molting function. Conclusion: We provided a comprehensive resource of miRNAs associated with insect molting and identified a novel miRNA as a potential target for pest control. "
negative,"A genome-wide analysis of courting and mating responses in Drosophila melanogaster females. In Drosophila melanogaster, seminal fluid proteins influence several components of female physiology and behavior, including re-mating rates, ovulation and oviposition, and sperm use. It is well-known that female flies are not simply passive vessels and that female-mediated interactions with male products are important to female (and thus male) reproductive success. While the population genetics, molecular evolution and physiological effects of seminal fluid proteins have been examined, the genetics and evolution of the female side of these post-mating interactions is unexplored in spite of work showing that female genotype and female-by-male genotype interactions are important determinants of sperm competition outcomes. Here we use microarrays to identify candidate genes involved in the female side of post-mating sexual interactions. We report the results of a whole-genome oligonucleotide chip experiment that reveals 23 genes differentially expressed between virgin females exposed and unexposed to courting males, and 38 genes differentially expressed between virgin and recently mated females. Immune related genes are overrepresented among the mating-influenced candidates. We use quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR to independently assess gene expression changes for roughly half of the mating-affected candidate genes. "
positive,"Overexpression of Gloverin2 in the Bombyx mori silk gland enhances cocoon / silk antimicrobial activity. The Bombyx mori cocoon / silk possesses many immune-related components, including protease inhibitors, seroins, and antimicrobial peptides, which likely help to protect the pupating larva from infection. However, the natural antimicrobial activity of the B. mori cocoon / silk is still too weak for biomedical applications. With the goal of enhancing this natural activity, we constructed a transgenic vector to overexpress the B. mori antimicrobial peptide Gloverin2 (BmGlv2) under control of the silk gland-specific Serion1 promoter. Transgenic silkworms were generated via embryo microinjection. A low level of BmGlv2 was expressed in the non-transgenic silk gland, but BmGlv2 was efficiently overexpressed and proteolytically activated in the transgenic line. Overexpressed BmGlv2 was secreted and incorporated into the silk during spanning without affecting cocoon / silk formation. Moreover, the transgenic cocoon / silk had significantly greater inhibitory activity against bacteria and fungi than the non-transgenic cocoon / silk. This strategy could help enhance the antimicrobial performance and biomedical application of silk. "
positive,"Identification of the chitinase genes from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Chitinases have an indispensable function in chitin metabolism and are well characterized in numerous insect species. Although the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella, which has a high reproductive potential, short generation time, and characteristic adaptation to adverse environments, has become one of the most serious pests of cruciferous plants worldwide, the information on the chitinases of the moth is presently limited. In the present study, using degenerated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR strategies, four chitinase genes of P. xylostella were cloned, and an exhaustive search was conducted for chitinase-like sequences from the P. xylostella genome and transcriptomic database. Based on the domain analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences and the phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domain sequences, we identified 15 chitinase genes from P. xylostella. Two of the gut-specific chitinases did not cluster with any of the known phylogenetic groups of chitinases and might be in a new group of the chitinase family. Moreover, in our study, group VIII chitinase was not identified. The structures, classifications and expression patterns of the chitinases of P. xylostella were further delineated, and with this information, further investigations on the functions of chitinase genes in DBM could be facilitated. "
negative,"Draft Genome of Busseola fusca, the Maize Stalk Borer, a Major Crop Pest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca, is an important Lepidopteran pest of cereal crops in Central, East, and Southern Africa. Crop losses due to B. fusca feeding activity vary by region, but can result in total crop loss in areas with high levels of infestation. Genomic resources provide critical insight into the biology of pest species and can allow for the development of effective management tools and strategies to mitigate their impact on agriculture. To this end, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of B. fusca. The total assembled genome size was 492.9 Mb with 19,417 annotated protein-coding genes. Using a comparative approach, we identified a putative expansion in the Chorion gene family, which is involved in the formation of the egg shell structure. Our analysis revealed high repeat content within the B. fusca genome, with LTR sequences comprising the majority of the repetitive sequence. We hope genomic resources will provide a foundation for future work aimed at developing an integrated pest management strategy to reduce B. fusca's impact on food security. "
negative,"Fine mapping of the soybean aphid-resistance genes Rag6 and Rag3c from Glycine soja 85-32. KEY MESSAGE: Rag6 and Rag3c were delimited to a 49-kb interval on chromosome 8 and a 150-kb interval on chromosome 16, respectively. Structural variants in the exons of candidate genes were identified. The soybean aphid, an invasive species, has significantly threatened soybean production in North America since 2000. Host-plant resistance is known as an ideal management strategy for aphids. Two novel aphid-resistance loci, Rag6 and Rag3c, from Glycine soja 85-32, were previously detected in a 10.5-cM interval on chromosome 8 and a 7.5-cM interval on chromosome 16, respectively. Defining the exact genomic position of these two genes is critical for improving the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection for aphid resistance and for identification of the functional genes. To pinpoint the locations of Rag6 and Rag3c, four populations segregating for Rag6 and Rag3c were used to fine map these two genes. The availability of the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K / 8K iSelect BeadChip, combined with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers discovered through the whole-genome re-sequencing of E12901, facilitated the fine mapping process. Rag6 was refined to a 49-kb interval on chromosome 8 with four candidate genes, including three clustered nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes and an amine oxidase encoding gene. Rag3c was refined to a 150-kb interval on chromosome 16 with 11 candidate genes, two of which are a LRR gene and a lipase gene. Moreover, by sequencing the whole-genome exome-capture of the resistant source (E12901), structural variants were identified in the exons of the candidate genes of Rag6 and Rag3c. The closely linked SNP markers and the candidate gene information presented in this study will be significant resources for integrating Rag6 and Rag3c into elite cultivars and for future functional genetics studies.

negative,"Putting the genome in insect phylogenomics. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide a substantial increase in the size of molecular phylogenetic datasets that can be obtained for studies of insect systematics. Several new genome reduction approaches are leveraging these technologies to generate large phylogenomic datasets: targeted amplicon sequencing, target capture, and transcriptome sequencing. Although cost effective, these approaches provide limited data for questions outside of phylogenetics. For many groups of insects, sequencing the entire genome at modest coverage is feasible. Using these genomic reads, an automated Target Restricted Assembly Method (aTRAM) can use the results of blast searches to assemble thousands of single copy ortholog genes across a group of interest. These locally assembled genes can then be compiled into very large phylogenomic datasets. These genomic libraries have the advantage in that they also contain reads from the mitochondrial genome and symbiont genomes, as well the entire insect genome, and can be leveraged for additional studies beyond phylogenetics. "
negative,"What can genetic association panels tell us about evolutionary processes in insects? If we are to fully comprehend the evolution of insect diversity at a genomic level we need to understand how natural selection can alter genetically encoded characters within populations. Genetic association panels have the potential to be standard bearers in this endeavour. They enable the mapping of phenotypes to genotypes at unprecedented resolution while simultaneously providing population genomic samples that can be interrogated for the tell-tale signs of selection. Analyses of these panels promise to elucidate the entanglement of gene ontologies, pathways, developmental processes and evolutionary constraints, and inform how these are shaped by adaptation. "
negative,"Comparative Genomics of Lactobacillus brevis Reveals a Significant Plasmidome Overlap of Brewery and Insect Isolates. Lactobacillus (L.) brevis represents a versatile, ubiquitistic species of lactic acid bacteria, occurring in various foods, as well as plants and intestinal tracts. The ability to deal with considerably differing environmental conditions in the respective ecological niches implies a genomic adaptation to the particular requirements to use it as a habitat beyond a transient state. Given the isolation source, 24 L. brevis genomes were analyzed via comparative genomics to get a broad view of the genomic complexity and ecological versatility of this species. This analysis showed L. brevis being a genetically diverse species possessing a remarkably large pan genome. As anticipated, it proved difficult to draw a correlation between chromosomal settings and isolation source. However, on plasmidome level, brewery- and insect-derived strains grouped into distinct clusters, referable to a noteworthy gene sharing between both groups. The brewery-specific plasmidome is characterized by several genes, which support a life in the harsh environment beer, but 40% of the brewery plasmidome were found in insect-derived strains as well. This suggests a close interaction between these habitats. Further analysis revealed the presence of a truncated horC cluster version in brewery- and insect-associated strains. This disproves horC, the major contributor to survival in beer, as brewery isolate specific. We conclude that L. brevis does not perform rigorous chromosomal changes to live in different habitats. Rather it appears that the species retains a certain genetic diversity in the plasmidome and meets the requirements of a particular ecological niche with the acquisition of appropriate plasmids. "
negative,"Transcriptome Analysis of the Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Integument. The insect integument, formed by the cuticle and the underlying epidermis, is essential for insect fitness, regulation of lipid biosynthesis and storage, insect growth and feeding, together with development progress. Its participation in insecticide resistance has also been outlined. Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is one of the major vectors of Chagas disease in South America; however, genomic data are scarce. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the nymph integument in order to identify which genes are expressed and their putative role. Using the 454 GS-FLX sequencing platform, we obtained approximately 144,620 reads from the integument tissue. These reads were assembled into 6,495 isotigs and 8,504 singletons. Based on BLAST similarity searches, about 8,000 transcripts were annotated with known genes, conserved domains, and / or Gene Ontology terms.The most abundant transcripts corresponded to transcription factors and nucleic acid metabolism, membrane receptors, cell signaling, and proteins related to cytoskeleton, transport, and cell energy processes, among others. More than 10% of the transcripts-encoded proteins putatively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and related components (fatty acid synthases, elongases, desaturases, fatty alcohol reductases), structural integument proteins, and the insecticide detoxification system (among them, cytochrome P450s, esterases, and glutathione transferases). Real-time qPCR assays were used to investigate their putative participation in the resistance mechanism. This preliminary study is the first transcriptome analysis of a triatomine integument, and together with prior biochemical information, will help further understandthe role of the integument in a wide array of mechanisms. "
negative,"Characterization of pea aphid resistance in Medicago truncatula. To achieve a thorough understanding of plant-aphid interactions, it is necessary to investigate in detail both the plant and insect side of the interaction. The pea aphid (PA; Acyrthosiphon pisum) has been selected by an international consortium as the model species for genetics and genomics studies, and the model legume Medicago truncatula is a host of this aphid. In this study, we identified resistance to PA in a M. truncatula line, 'Jester', with well-characterized resistance to a closely related aphid, the bluegreen aphid (BGA; Acyrthosiphon kondoi). The biology of resistance to the two aphid species shared similarity, with resistance in both cases occurring at the level of the phloem, requiring an intact plant and involving a combination of antixenosis, antibiosis, and plant tolerance. In addition, PA resistance cosegregated in 'Jester' with a single dominant gene for BGA resistance. These results raised the possibility that both resistances may be mediated by the same mechanism. This was not supported by the results of gene induction studies, and resistance induced by BGA had no effect on PA feeding. Moreover, different genetic backgrounds containing a BGA resistance gene from the same resistance donor differ in resistance to PA. These results suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in resistance to these two aphid species. Resistance to PA and BGA in the same genetic background in M. truncatula makes this plant an attractive model for the study of both plant and aphid components of resistant and susceptible plant-aphid interactions. "
positive,"Knockdown of the aminopeptidase N genes decreases susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis larvae to Cry1Ab / Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticide is currently the most widely used bioinsecticide. Bt expressing cry genes are some of the most successful foreign-genome-inserting genes used in transgenic insect-resistant crop development. Cry toxins are resistant to lepidopteran pests, such as Chilo suppressalis, a major insect pest of rice worldwide. Since Cry toxins exert their activity by binding to specific receptors in the midgut of target insects, identification of functional Cry toxin receptors in the midgut of C. suppressalis larvae is crucial to evaluate potential resistance mechanisms and develop effective strategies for inhibiting insect resistance. In this study, we isolated two aminopeptidase N genes (APN6 and APN8) from C. suppressalis and determined that they were expressed in the foregut. APN6 was highly expressed at the fourth instar, and APN8 was highly expressed in adult and pupa. Knockdown of CsAPN6 and CsAPN8 by RNA interference resulted in significantly decreased susceptibility of larvae to Bt rice varieties TT51 (expressing cry1Ac / cry1Ab fusion genes) and T1C-19 (expressing cry1Ca), but not T2A-1 (expressing cry2Aa). These findings suggest that both APN6 and APN8 are involved in the toxicity of Cry1Ac / Cry1Ab and Cry1Ca toxins. "
negative,"Genome-wide gene expression in response to parasitoid attack in Drosophila. BACKGROUND: Parasitoids are insect parasites whose larvae develop in the bodies of other insects. The main immune defense against parasitoids is encapsulation of the foreign body by blood cells, which subsequently often melanize. The capsule sequesters and kills the parasite. The molecular processes involved are still poorly understood, especially compared with insect humoral immunity. RESULTS: We explored the transcriptional response to parasitoid attack in Drosophila larvae at nine time points following parasitism, hybridizing five biologic replicates per time point to whole-genome microarrays for both parasitized and control larvae. We found significantly different expression profiles for 159 probe sets (representing genes), and we classified them into 16 clusters based on patterns of co-expression. A series of functional annotations were nonrandomly associated with different clusters, including several involving immunity and related functions. We also identified nonrandom associations of transcription factor binding sites for three main regulators of innate immune responses (GATA / srp-like, NF-kappaB / Rel-like and Stat), as well as a novel putative binding site for an unknown transcription factor. The appearance or absence of candidate genes previously associated with insect immunity in our differentially expressed gene set was surveyed. CONCLUSION: Most genes that exhibited altered expression following parasitoid attack differed from those induced during antimicrobial immune responses, and had not previously been associated with defense. Applying bioinformatic techniques contributed toward a description of the encapsulation response as an integrated system, identifying putative regulators of co-expressed and functionally related genes. Genome-wide studies such as ours are a powerful first approach to investigating novel genes involved in invertebrate immunity. "
positive,"Chitin deacetylase 1 and 2 are indispensable for larval-pupal and pupal-adult molts in Heortia vitessoides (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Heortia vitessoides Moore is a notorious defoliator of Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg trees. Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) catalyze the N-deacetylation of chitin, which is a crucial process for chitin modification. Here, we identified and characterized HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 from H. vitessoides. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 possess typical domain structures of CDAs and belong to the Group I CDAs. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 were highly expressed before and after the larval-larval molt. In addition, both exhibited relatively high mRNA expression levels during the larval-pupal molt, the pupal stage, and the pupal-adult molt. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were highest in the body wall and relatively high in the larval head. Significant increases in the HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were observed in the larvae upon exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone. RNA interference-mediated HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 silencing significantly inhibited HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 expression, with abnormal or nonviable phenotypes being observed. Post injection survival rates of the larvae injected with dsHvCDA1 and dsHvCDA2 were 66.7% and 46.7% (larval-pupal) during development and 23.0% and 6.7% (pupal-adult), respectively. These rates were significantly lower than those of the control group insects. Our results suggest that HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 play important roles in the larval-pupal and pupal-adult transitions and represent potential targets for the management of H. vitessoides. "
positive,"Evolutionary divergence of the paralogs Methoprene tolerant (Met) and germ cell expressed (gce) within the genus Drosophila. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling underpins both regulatory and developmental pathways in insects. However, the JH receptor is poorly understood. Methoprene tolerant (Met) and germ cell expressed (gce) have been implicated in JH signaling in Drosophila. We investigated the evolution of Met and gce across 12 Drosophila species and found that these paralogs are conserved across at least 63 million years of dipteran evolution. Distinct patterns of selection found using estimates of dN / dS ratios across Drosophila Met and gce coding sequences, along with their incongruent temporal expression profiles in embryonic Drosophila melanogaster, illustrate avenues through which these genes have diverged within the Diptera. Additionally, we demonstrate that the annotated gene CG15032 is the 5' terminus of gce. In mosquitoes and beetles, a single Met-like homolog displays structural similarity to both Met and gce, and the intron locations are conserved with those of gce. We found that Tribolium and mosquito Met orthologs are assembled from Met- and gce-specific domains in a modular fashion. Our results suggest that Drosophila Met and gce experienced divergent evolutionary pressures following the duplication of an ancestral gce-like gene found in less derived holometabolous insects. "
negative,"The whole genome sequence of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), reveals insights into the biology and adaptive evolution of a highly invasive pest species. BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is a major destructive insect pest due to its broad host range, which includes hundreds of fruits and vegetables. It exhibits a unique ability to invade and adapt to ecological niches throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, though medfly infestations have been prevented and controlled by the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of integrated pest management programs (IPMs). The genetic analysis and manipulation of medfly has been subject to intensive study in an effort to improve SIT efficacy and other aspects of IPM control. RESULTS: The 479 Mb medfly genome is sequenced from adult flies from lines inbred for 20 generations. A high-quality assembly is achieved having a contig N50 of 45.7 kb and scaffold N50 of 4.06 Mb. In-depth curation of more than 1800 messenger RNAs shows specific gene expansions that can be related to invasiveness and host adaptation, including gene families for chemoreception, toxin and insecticide metabolism, cuticle proteins, opsins, and aquaporins. We identify genes relevant to IPM control, including those required to improve SIT. CONCLUSIONS: The medfly genome sequence provides critical insights into the biology of one of the most serious and widespread agricultural pests. This knowledge should significantly advance the means of controlling the size and invasive potential of medfly populations. Its close relationship to Drosophila, and other insect species important to agriculture and human health, will further comparative functional and structural studies of insect genomes that should broaden our understanding of gene family evolution. "
negative,"Functional genomics and insect chemical ecology. High-throughput molecular techniques (i.e., genomics) are now beginning to make their way into chemical ecology research. Pioneering functional genomics studies have made significant contributions to our understanding of insect pheromone production, reception, behavior, and insect-plant interactions. Much of this research involves nonmodel organisms, including the honey bee, silkworm, and bark beetles, underscoring that researchers need not be restricted to traditional model organisms for high-throughput research. Furthermore, the technology can reveal physiological interactions that might otherwise be missed by more traditional molecular approaches. Functional genomics should become more widely used as researchers appreciate the wealth of information this potent approach can supply. This review concentrates on a summary of available technologies for functional genomics as they may be applied by chemical ecologists studying insects. Allied technologies (proteomics and metabolomics) are introduced briefly toward the end in the context of future applications. "
negative,"Use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to estimate the size of the house-fly Musca domestica genome. House-flies, Musca domestica, are carriers of more than 100 devastating diseases that have severe consequences for human and animal health. A key bottleneck to progress in controlling the devastating human diseases transmitted by house-flies is lack of knowledge of the basic molecular biology of this species. However, before sequencing of the house-fly genome can be seriously considered it is important to know the size of the genome. In this paper, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to calculate genome size of the house-fly in side-by-side experiments with Drosophila melanogaster (known genome size of 180 Mb). Our results indicate the size of the house-fly genome is 295 + / - 10 Mb and that of D. melanogaster is 184 Mb. Thus, the house-fly genome is only about 1.6-fold larger than the genome of D. melanogaster. This indicates that the size of the house-fly genome makes it an excellent candidate for whole genome sequencing and that quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is an accurate method for the estimation of the size of insect genomes. "
negative,"Sperm Cells of a Primitive Strepsipteran. The unusual life style of Strepsiptera has presented a long-standing puzzle in establishing its affinity to other insects. Although Strepsiptera share few structural similarities with other insect orders, all members of this order share a parasitic life style with members of two distinctive families in the Coleoptera-the order now considered the most closely related to Strepsiptera based on recent genomic evidence. Among the structural features of several strepsipteran families and other insect families that have been surveyed are the organization of testes and ultrastructure of sperm cells. For comparison with existing information on insect sperm structure, this manuscript presents a description of testes and sperm of a representative of the most primitive extant strepsipteran family Mengenillidae, Eoxenos laboulbenei. We compare sperm structure of E. laboulbenei from this family with that of the three other families of Strepsiptera in the other strepsipteran suborder Stylopidia that have been studied as well as with members of the beetle families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae that share similar life histories with Strepsiptera. Meloids, Rhipiphorids and Strepsipterans all begin larval life as active and viviparous first instar larvae. This study examines global features of these insects' sperm cells along with specific ultrastructural features of their organelles.  "
positive,"Identification of a sugar gustatory receptor and its effect on fecundity of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. In insects, the gustatory system plays a crucial role in multiple physiological behaviors, including feeding, toxin avoidance, courtship, mating and oviposition. Gustatory stimuli from the environment are recognized by gustatory receptors. To date, little is known about the function of gustatory receptors in agricultural pest insects. In this study, we cloned a sugar gustatory receptor gene, NlGr11, from the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a serious pest of rice in Asia; we then identified its ligands, namely, fructose, galactose and arabinose, by calcium imaging assay. After injection of NlGr11 double-stranded RNA, we found that the number of eggs laid by BPH decreased. Moreover, we found that NlGr11 inhibited the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT). These findings demonstrated that NlGr11 could accelerate the fecundity of BPH through AMPK- and AKT-mediated signaling pathways. This is the first report to indicate that a gustatory receptor modulates the fecundity of insects and that the receptor could be a potential target for pest control. "
positive,"Heteromeric co-assembly of two insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunits: influence on sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively in areas of crop protection and animal health to control a variety of insect pest species. Here, we describe studies performed with nAChR subunits Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 cloned from the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a major insect pest of rice crops in many parts of Asia. The influence of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits upon the functional properties of recombinant nAChRs has been examined by expression in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, the influence of a Nlalpha1 mutation (Y151S), which has been linked to neonicotinoid lab generated resistance in N. lugens, has been examined. As in previous studies of insect alpha subunits, functional expression has been achieved by co-expression with the mammalian beta2 subunit. This approach has revealed a significantly higher apparent affinity of imidacloprid for Nlalpha1 / beta2 than for Nlalpha2 / beta2 nAChRs. In addition, evidence has been obtained for the co-assembly of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits into 'triplet' nAChRs of subunit composition Nlalpha1 / Nlalpha2 / beta2. Evidence has also been obtained which demonstrates that the resistance-associated Y151S mutation has a significantly reduced effect on neonicotinoid agonist activity when Nlalpha1 is co-assembled with Nlalpha2 than when expressed as the sole alpha subunit in a heteromeric nAChR. These findings may be of importance in assessing the likely impact of the target-site mutations such as Y151S upon neonicotinoid insecticide resistance in insect field populations. "
negative,"Structural divergence among genomes of closely related baculoviruses and its implications for baculovirus evolution. Baculoviruses are members of a large, well-characterized family of dsDNA viruses that have been identified from insects of the orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera. Baculovirus genomes from different virus species generally exhibit a considerable degree of structural diversity. However, some sequenced baculovirus genomes from closely related viruses are structurally very similar and share overall nucleotide sequence identities in excess of 95%. This review focuses on the comparative analysis of partial and complete nucleotide sequences from two groups of closely related baculoviruses with broad host ranges: (a) group I multiple nucleopolyhedroviruses (MNPVs) from a cluster including Autographa californica (Ac)MNPV, Rachiplusia ou (Ro)MNPV, and Plutella xylostella (Plxy)MNPV; and (b) granuloviruses (GVs) from a cluster including Xestia c-nigrum (Xecn)GV and Helicoverpa armigera (Hear)GV. Even though the individual viruses in these clusters share high nucleotide sequence identities, a significant degree of genomic rearrangement (in the form of insertions, deletions, and homologous recombination resulting in allelic replacement) is evident from alignments of their genomes. These observations suggest an important role for recombination in the early evolution and biological characteristics of baculoviruses of these two groups. "
negative,"Building a platform for predicting functions of serine protease-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and other insects. Serine proteases (SPs) and serine protease homologs (SPHs) play essential roles in insect physiological processes including digestion, defense and development. Studies of insect genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes have generated a vast amount of information on these proteins, dwarfing the biological data acquired from a few model species. The large number and high diversity of homologous sequences makes it a challenge to use the limited functional information for making predictions across a broad taxonomic group of insects. In this work, we have extensively updated the framework of knowledge on the SP-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster by identifying 52 new SPs / SPHs, classifying the 257 proteins into four groups (CLIP, gut, single- and multi-domain SPs / SPHs), and detecting inherent connections among phylogenetic relationships, genomic locations and expression profiles for 99 of the genes. Information on the existence of specific proteins in eggs, larvae, pupae and adults is presented to facilitate future research. More importantly, we have developed an approach to reveal close homologous or orthologous relationships among SPs / SPHs from D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Manduca sexta, and Tribolium castaneum thus inspiring functional studies in these and other holometabolous insects. This approach is useful for tackling similar problems on large and diverse protein families in other groups of organisms. "
positive,"G119S ace-1 mutation conferring insecticide resistance detected in the Culex pipiens complex in Morocco. BACKGROUND: Arboviruses are controlled through insecticide control of their mosquito vector. However, inconsiderate use of insecticides often results in the selection of resistance in treated populations, so that monitoring is required to optimize their usage. Here, Culex pipiens (West Nile and Rift Valley Fever virus vector) specimens were collected from four Moroccan cities. Levels of susceptibility to the organophosphate (OP) insecticide malathion were assessed using World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended bioassays. Individual mosquitoes were tested for the presence of the G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene, the main OP-target resistance mutation. RESULTS: Bioassays showed that mosquitoes from Mohammedia were significantly more resistant to malathion than those from Marrakech. Analyzing the ace-1 genotypes in dead and surviving individuals suggested that other resistance mechanisms may be present in Mohammedia. The ace-1 resistance allele frequencies were relatively moderate (< 0.4). Their analyses in three Moroccan cities (Tangier, Casablanca and Marrakech) however showed disparities between two coexisting Cx. pipiens forms and revealed that the G119S mutation tends to be more frequent in urban than in rural collection sites. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a reference assessment of OP resistance in Morocco and should help the health authorities to develop informed and sustainable vector control programs. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"The Aedes aegypti larval transcriptome: a comparative perspective with emphasis on trypsins and the domain structure of peritrophins. The genome sequence of Aedes aegypti was recently reported. A significant amount of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were sequenced to aid in the gene prediction process. In the present work we describe an integrated analysis of the genomic and EST data, focusing on genes with preferential expression in larvae (LG), adults (AG) and in both stages (SG). A total of 913 genes (5.4% of the transcript complement) are LG, including ion transporters and cuticle proteins that are important for ion homeostasis and defense. From a starting set of 245 genes encoding the trypsin domain, we identified 66 putative LG, AG, and SG trypsins by manual curation. Phylogenetic analyses showed that AG trypsins are divergent from their larval counterparts (LG), grouping with blood-induced trypsins from Anopheles gambiae and Simulium vittatum. These results support the hypothesis that blood-feeding arose only once, in the ancestral Culicomorpha. Peritrophins are proteins that interlock chitin fibrils to form the peritrophic membrane (PM) that compartmentalizes the food in the midgut. These proteins are recognized by having chitin-binding domains with 6 conserved Cys and may also present mucin-like domains (regions expected to be highly O-glycosylated). PM may be formed by a ring of cells (type 2, seen in Ae. aegypti larvae and Drosophila melanogaster) or by most midgut cells (type 1, found in Ae. aegypti adult and Tribolium castaneum). LG and D. melanogaster peritrophins have more complex domain structures than AG and T. castaneum peritrophins. Furthermore, mucin-like domains of peritrophins from T. castaneum (feeding on rough food) are lengthier than those of adult Ae. aegypti (blood-feeding). This suggests, for the first time, that type 1 and type 2 PM may have variable molecular architectures determined by different peritrophins and / or ancillary proteins, which may be partly modulated by diet. "
positive,"All-trans retinoic acid affects subcellular localization of a novel BmNIF3l protein: functional deduce and tissue distribution of NIF3l gene from silkworm (Bombyx mori). A novel cDNA sequence encoding a predicted protein of 271 amino acids containing a conserved NIF3 domain was found from a pupal cDNA library of silkworm. The corresponding gene was named BmNIF3l (Bombyx mori NGG1p interacting factor 3-like). It was found by bioinformatics that BmNIF3l gene consisted of five exons and four introns and BmNIF3l had a high degree of homology to other NIF3-like proteins, especially in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. A His-tagged BmNIF3l fusion protein with a molecular weight of approximately 33.6 kDa was expressed and purified to homogeneity. We have used the purified fusion protein to produce polyclonal antibodies against BmNIF3l for histochemical analysis. Subcellular localization revealed that BmNIF3l is a cytoplasmic protein that responds to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression level of BmNIF3l is higher in tissues undergoing differentiation. Taken together, the results suggest that BmNIF3l functions in transcription. "
negative,"piggyBac internal sequences are necessary for efficient transformation of target genomes. A previously reported piggyBac minimal sequence cartridge, which is capable of efficient transposition in embryo interplasmid transposition assays, failed to produce transformants at a significant frequency in Drosophila melanogaster compared with full-length or less extensive internal deletion constructs. We have re-examined the importance of these internal domain (ID) sequences for germline transformation using a PCR strategy that effectively adds increasing lengths of ID sequences to each terminus. A series of these piggyBac ID synthetic deletion plasmids containing the 3xP3-ECFP marker gene are compared for germline transformation of D. melanogaster. Our analyses identify a minimal sequence configuration that is sufficient for movement of piggyBac vectored sequences from plasmids into the insect genome. Southern hybridizations confirm the presence of the piggyBac transposon sequences, and insertion site analyses confirm these integrations target TTAA sites. The results verify that ID sequences adjacent to the 5' and 3' terminal repeat domains are crucial for effective germline transformation with piggyBac even though they are not required for excision or interplasmid transposition. Using this information we reconstructed an inverted repeat cartridge, ITR1.1k, and a minimal piggyBac transposon vector, pXL-BacII-ECFP, each of which contains these identified ID sequences in addition to the terminal repeat configuration previously described as essential for mobility. We confirm in independent experiments that these new minimal constructs yield transformation frequencies similar to the control piggyBac vector. Sequencing analyses of our constructs verify the position and the source of a point mutation within the 3' internal repeat sequence of our vectors that has no apparent effect on transformation efficiency. "
negative,"Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Host-Plant Resistance to Soybean Aphid. Soybean aphid [ Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] is the most damaging insect pest of soybean [ (L.) Merr.] in the Upper Midwest of the United States and is primarily controlled by insecticides. Soybean aphid resistance (i.e., genes) has been documented in some soybean accessions but more sources of resistance are needed. Incorporation of the resistance into marketed varieties has also been slow. Genome-wide association mapping can aid in identifying resistant accessions by correlating phenotypic data with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a genome. Aphid population measures from 2366 soybean accessions were collected from published studies screening cultivated soybean () and wild soybean ( Siebold & Zucc.) with aphids exhibiting Biotype 1, 2, or 3 characteristics. Genotypic data were obtained from the SoySNP50K high-density genotyping array previously used to genotype the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. Significant associations between SNPs and soybean aphid counts were found on 18 of the 20 soybean chromosomes. Significant SNPs were found on chromosomes 7, 8, 13, and 16 with known genes. SNPs were also significant on chromosomes 1, 2, 4 to 6, 9 to 12, 14, and 17 to 20 where genes have not yet been mapped, suggesting that many genes remain to be discovered. These SNPs can be used to determine accessions that are likely to have novel aphid resistance traits of value for breeding programs. "
negative,"Comparative mitochondrial genome analysis of Spilarctia subcarnea and other noctuid insects. This study was performed to better understand the phylogenetic relationships within the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea. The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has been extensively used for studying phylogenetic relationships at different taxonomic levels. In this study, the complete mitogenome of Spilarctia subcarnea (Noctuoidea: Erebidae) was sequenced and annotated. The mitogenome is 15,441bp in length, containing 13 typical protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and a noncoding control region (CR). The order and orientation of genes of S. subcarnea mitogenome with the order trnM-trnI-trnQ-nad2 is different from the ancestral insects in which trnM is located between trnQ and nad2 (trnI-trnQ-trnM-nad2). The phylogenetic relationships based on mitochondrial sequences using Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood methods showed that S. subcarnea was closely related to Lemyra melli, supporting that S. subcarnea belongs to Erebidae. These analyses confirm that Lymantriidae should be included as subfamilies within Erebidae. The Erebidae was sister to (Nolidae+(Euteliidae+Noctuidae)); Notodontidae is sister to the other families of Noctuoidea in our study. "
negative,"Detection and analysis of alternative splicing in the silkworm by aligning expressed sequence tags with the genomic sequence. We identified 277 alternative splice forms in silkworm genes based on aligning expressed sequence tags with genomic sequences, using a transcript assembly program. A large fraction (74%) of these alternative splices are located in protein-coding regions and alter protein products, whereas only 26% are in untranslated regions. From the alternative splices located in protein-coding regions, some (43%) affect protein domains that bind various biological molecules. The vast majority of the detected alternative forms in this study appear to be novel, and potentially affect biologically meaningful control of function in silkworm genes. Our results indicate that alternative splicing in silkworm largely produces protein diversity and functional diversity, and is a widely used mechanism for regulating gene expression. "
negative,"IPB7 transposase behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. Transposons are used in insect science as genetic tools that enable the transformation of insects and the identification and isolation of genes though their ability to insert in or near to them. Four transposons, piggyBac, Mos1, Hermes and Minos are commonly used in insects beyond Drosophila melanogaster with piggyBac, due to its wide host range and frequency of transposition, being the most commonly chosen. The utility of these transposons as genetic tools is directly proportional to their activity since higher transposition rates would be expected to lead to higher transformation frequencies and higher frequencies of insertion throughout the genome. As a consequence there is an ongoing need for hyperactive transposases for use in insect genetics, however these have proven difficult to obtain. IPB7 is a hyperactive mutant of the piggyBac transposase that was identified by a genetic screen performed in yeast, a mammalian codon optimized version of which was then found to be highly active in rodent embryonic stem cells with no apparent deleterious effects. Here we report the activity of IPB7 in D. melanogaster and the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Somatic transposition assays revealed an increase in IPB7's transposition rate from wild-type piggyBac transposase in D. melanogaster but not Ae. aegypti. However the use of IPB7 in D. melanogaster genetic transformations produced a high rate of sterility and a low transformation rate compared to wild-type transposase. This high rate of sterility was accompanied by significant gonadal atrophy that was also observed in the absence of the piggyBac vector transposon. We conclude that IPB7 has increased activity in the D. melanogaster germ-line but that a component of the sterility associated with its activity is independent of the presence of the piggyBac transposon.  "
negative,"The distinct properties of natural and GM cry insecticidal proteins. The Cry toxins are a family of crystal-forming proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Their mode of action is thought to be to create pores that disrupt the gut epithelial membranes of juvenile insects. These pores allow pathogen entry into the hemocoel, thereby killing the insect. Genes encoding a spectrum of Cry toxins, including Cry mutants, Cry chimaeras and other Cry derivatives, are used commercially to enhance insect resistance in genetically modified (GM) crops. In most countries of the world, such GM crops are regulated and must be assessed for human and environmental safety. However, such risk assessments often do not test the GM crop or its tissues directly. Instead, assessments rely primarily on historical information from naturally occurring Cry proteins and on data collected on Cry proteins (called 'surrogates') purified from laboratory strains of bacteria engineered to express Cry protein. However, neither surrogates nor naturally occurring Cry proteins are identical to the proteins to which humans or other nontarget organisms are exposed by the production and consumption of GM plants. To-date there has been no systematic survey of these differences. This review fills this knowledge gap with respect to the most commonly grown GM Cry-containing crops approved for international use. Having described the specific differences between natural, surrogate and GM Cry proteins this review assesses these differences for their potential to undermine the reliability of risk assessments. Lastly, we make specific recommendations for improving risk assessments. "
positive,"The regulation of crecropin-A and gloverin 2 by the silkworm Toll-like gene 18 wheeler in immune response. The innate immune system is conserved among different insect species in its response to microorganism infection. The transmembrane receptors of the Toll superfamily play an important role in activating immune response, however, the function of silkworm Toll family member 18 Wheeler (18 W) remained unclear. Here, the 18w gene in silkworm was characterized. A relatively high transcription level of Bm18w mRNA was found in Malpighian tubules, and in eggs, larvae pre-molt to fourth instar, pupae and adults. When silkworm larvae were infected with E. coli or S. aureus, Bm18w showed a significant response, especially to E. coli, but did not have antibacterial activity. To further identify the downstream antimicrobial peptide genes of Bm18w, expression of Bm18w was knocked down with siRNA in vitro, resulting in significant decreases of cecropin-A, gloverin 2, and moricin B3. The overexpression of Bm18w was carried out using pIZT / V5-His-mCherry insect vector in BmN cells and significant upregulation of cecropin-A and gloverin 2 was detected, as well as upregulation of attacin and defensin. Based on the results, we concluded that Bm18w is involved in response to bacterial infection by selectively inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, especially cecropin-A and gloverin 2. This study provides valuable data to supplement understanding of the immune pathway of the silkworm. "
positive,"Digestive beta-glucosidases from the wood-feeding higher termite, Nasutitermes takasagoensis: intestinal distribution, molecular characterization, and alteration in sites of expression. beta-Glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21] hydrolyzes cellobiose or cello-oligosaccharides into glucose during cellulose digestion in termites. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses of the digestive system in the higher termite Nasutitermes takasagoensis revealed that beta-glucosidase activity is localized in the salivary glands and midgut as dimeric glycoproteins. Degenerate PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the salivary beta-glucosidase resulted in cDNA fragments of 1.7 kb, encoding 489 amino acids with a sequence similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. Moreover, these primers amplified cDNA fragments from the midgut, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87-91% identical to those of the salivary beta-glucosidases. Successful expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli implies that these sequences also encode functional beta-glucosidases. These results indicate that beta-glucosidases that primarily contribute to the digestive process of N. takasagoensis are produced in the midgut. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated the site-specific expression of beta-glucosidase mRNAs in the salivary glands and midgut. These results suggest that termites have developed the ability to produce beta-glucosidases in the midgut, as is the case for endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, in which the site of expression has shifted from the salivary glands of lower termites to the midgut of higher termites. "
negative,"Biological and Genomic Sequence Characterization of Maize streak virus Isolates from Wheat. ABSTRACT Maize streak virus (MSV) is best known as the causal agent of maize streak disease. However, only a genetically uniform subset of the viruses within this diverse species is actually capable of producing severe symptoms in maize. Whereas these ""maize-type"" viruses all share greater than 95% sequence identity, MSV strains isolated from grasses may share as little as 79% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Here, we present the complete genome sequences and biological characterization of two MSV isolates from wheat that share approximately 89% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Clonal populations of these two isolates, named MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, were leafhopper-transmitted to Digitaria sanguinalis and a range of maize, wheat, and barley genotypes. Whereas the two viruses showed some differences in their pathogenicity in maize, they were both equally pathogenic in D. sanguinalis and the various wheat and barley genotypes tested. Phylogenetic analyses involving the genome sequences of MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, a new maize-type virus also fully sequenced in this study (MSV-VM), and all other available African streak virus sequences, indicated that MSV-Tas and MSV-VW are close relatives that together represent a distinct MSV strain. Sequence analyses revealed that MSV-VM has a recombinant genome containing MSV-Tas / VW-like sequences within its movement protein gene. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the bristletail Petrobius brevistylis (Archaeognatha: Machilidae). The complete mitochondrial genome of the bristletail Petrobius brevistylis has been determined. The genome is 15,698 bp long and bears the standard set of genes common to all arthropods as well as a major non-coding A+T-rich region, the putative mitochondrial control region. A unique gene order was revealed as it differs from other hexapod and crustacean mitochondrial genomes in the position of tRNA-Tyr. Genome features like nucleotide composition and codon usage are compared with that of other insect taxa. A+T content is similar in species of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, but obviously lower than in Collembola and Pterygota. This A+T bias significantly affects also amino acid frequencies and may be a problem for phylogenetic analyses. "
negative,"BgFas1: A fatty acid synthase gene required for both hydrocarbon and cuticular fatty acid biosynthesis in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the evolutionary products of aquatic hexapod ancestors expanding to terrestrial environment, are deposited on the surface of insect integument and originally functioned primarily as waterproofing agents. CHCs are derived from the conserved fatty acid synthesis pathway in insects. However, the pivotal fatty acid synthase (FAS) involved in hydrocarbon (HC) biosynthesis remains unknown in many insect orders including the primitive Blattodea. Here, we investigated functional FAS genes that modulate cuticular lipid biogenesis in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Based on our full-length transcriptomic data and the available genomic data, seven FAS genes (BgFas1-7) were identified from B. germanica. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that BgFas1, BgFas3, BgFas4 and BgFas7 were highly expressed in the integument, whereas BgFas2 was dominantly expressed in the fat body. BgFas5 / 6 mRNA was almost negligible in the tested tissues. Systemic RNAi screen was performed against BgFas1-7, we found that only RNAi knockdown of BgFas1 caused a dramatic reduction of methyl-branched HCs (mbHCs) and a slight decrease of straight-chain HCs (scHCs) for both internal and external HCs. Significant reduction of cuticular free fatty acids (cFFAs) was also detected within BgFas1-repressed cockroaches, while repression of CYP4G19 resulted in dramatic increase of cFFAs. Moreover, we found that BgFas1 mRNA levels were correlated with insect molting cycles, and could be induced by long-term mild dryness treatment. Furthermore, desiccation assay revealed that BgFas1 suppression accelerated water loss and led to early death of cockroaches under desiccation. Our results indicate that BgFas1 is necessary for both HC and cFFA biosynthesis in B. germanica. In addition, our study also confirms that cuticular lipids, particularly mbCHCs, are critical for desiccation resistance in B. germanica. "
negative,"Low substitution rates in mitochondrial DNA in Mediterranean carabid beetles. The estimation of DNA substitution rates requires calibration with the geological events which caused the separation of populations. We used the disintegration of the landbridges between Morocco and Gibraltar as well as the Balearics and Spain at the end of the Messinian event (5.3 myr) in order to calibrate the DNA sequence data of the NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) in West Mediterranean Carabus species. The rates of molecular evolution we found are much lower than those reported in the literature and also vary from species to species. Therefore, in insects the calculation of divergence periods using a constant 2% substitution rate per myr is questionable. "
negative,"Alterations and Interchange of Morphometric Characters in Different Life Cycle Stages with Reference to Genomic Variations of Anopheles subpictus (Diptera; Culicidae) Sibling Species Complex in Sri Lanka. The species complex of the mosquito Anopheles subpictus is designated by the sibling species A⁻D, depending on morphological characters of life cycle stages and variations in polytene chromosomes. However, morphological aberrations in the life cycle stages make the identification of sibling species uncertain and imprecise. The objective of the present study is to determine the suitability of morphological variations of sibling species and their genomic variations to identify the sibling species status of an An. subpictus population in Sri Lanka. Life cycle stages of larvae, pupal exuviae, and adults were examined for previously reported distinctive morphological features. Five nuclear and mitochondrial genome regions, including the Internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, D3 region, white gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), and Cytochrome b (Cyt-b), were sequenced and analyzed for variations. The eggs changed their distinct sibling morphological characters during metamorphosis (89.33%). The larvae, pupal exuviae, and adult stages showed deviation from their sibling characters by 26.10%, 19.71%, and 15.87%, respectively. However, all the species from the analysis shared two distinct sequence types for all regions, regardless of the morphological variations. In conclusion, the An. subpictus sibling species complex in Sri Lanka is not identifiable using morphological characters due to variations, and the genomic variations are independent from the morphological variations. "
negative,"Sequence analysis and genomic organization of a new insect iflavirus, Sogatella furcifera honeydew virus 1. A novel iflavirus, tentatively named ""Sogatella furcifera honeydew virus 1"" (SFHV1), discovered through transcriptome sequencing analysis of white-backed planthoppers (Sogatella furcifera) collected in southern China, is described here. The full genome of SFHV1 is 10,837 nucleotides (nt) long, including the polyA tail, and shares 65.5% and 64.5% genomic identity with Laodelphax striatellus picorna-like virus 2 and Laodelphax striatella honeydew virus 1, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence and the deduced RdRp amino acid sequence of SFHV1 with other iflaviruses, we suggest that it is a member of a new species in the genus Iflavirus, family Iflaviridae. "
negative,"Genomic analysis of the interaction between pesticide exposure and nutrition in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Populations of pollinators are in decline worldwide. These declines are best documented in honey bees and are due to a combination of stressors. In particular, pesticides have been linked to decreased longevity and performance in honey bees; however, the molecular and physiological pathways mediating sensitivity and resistance to pesticides are not well characterized. We explored the impact of coumaphos and fluvalinate, the two most abundant and frequently detected pesticides in the hive, on genome-wide gene expression patterns of honey bee workers. We found significant changes in 1118 transcripts, including genes involved in detoxification, behavioral maturation, immunity, and nutrition. Since behavioral maturation is regulated by juvenile hormone III (JH), we examined effects of these miticides on hormone titers; while JH titers were unaffected, titers of methyl farnesoate (MF), the precursor to JH, were decreased. We further explored the association between nutrition- and pesticide-regulated gene expression patterns and demonstrated that bees fed a pollen-based diet exhibit reduced sensitivity to a third pesticide, chlorpyrifos. Finally, we demonstrated that expression levels of several of the putative pesticide detoxification genes identified in our study and previous studies are also upregulated in response to pollen feeding, suggesting that these pesticides and components in pollen modulate similar molecular response pathways. Our results demonstrate that pesticide exposure can substantially impact expression of genes involved in several core physiological pathways in honey bee workers. Additionally, there is substantial overlap in responses to pesticides and pollen-containing diets at the transcriptional level, and subsequent analyses demonstrated that pollen-based diets reduce workers' pesticide sensitivity. Thus, providing honey bees and other pollinators with high quality nutrition may improve resistance to pesticides.  "
negative,"Medicago truncatula as a model for understanding plant interactions with other organisms, plant development and stress biology: past, present and future. Medicago truncatula Gaertn. cv. Jemalong, a pasture species used in Australian agriculture, was first proposed as a model legume in 1990. Since that time M. truncatula, along with Lotus japonicus (Regal) Larsen, has contributed to major advances in understanding rhizobia Nod factor perception and the signalling pathway involved in nodule formation. Research using M. truncatula as a model has expanded beyond nodulation and the allied mycorrhizal research to investigate interactions with insect pests, plant pathogens and nematodes. In addition to biotic stresses the genetic mechanisms to ameliorate abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought are being investigated. Furthermore, M. truncatula is being used to increase understanding of plant development and cellular differentiation, with nodule differentiation providing a different perspective to organogenesis and meristem biology. This legume plant represents one of the major evolutionary success stories of plant adaptation to its environment, and it is particularly in understanding the capacity to integrate biotic and abiotic plant responses with plant growth and development that M. truncatula has an important role to play. The expanding genomic and genetic toolkit available with M. truncatula provides many opportunities for integrative biological research with a plant which is both a model for functional genomics and important in agricultural sustainability. "
negative,"Bacterial origin of a diverse family of UDP-glycosyltransferase genes in the Tetranychus urticae genome. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze the conjugation of a variety of small lipophilic molecules with uridine diphosphate (UDP) sugars, altering them into more water-soluble metabolites. Thereby, UGTs play an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the regulation of endobiotics. Recently, the genome sequence was reported for the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a polyphagous herbivore damaging a number of agricultural crops. Although various gene families implicated in xenobiotic metabolism have been documented in T. urticae, UGTs so far have not. We identified 80 UGT genes in the T. urticae genome, the largest number of UGT genes in a metazoan species reported so far. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lineage-specific gene expansions increased the diversity of the T. urticae UGT repertoire. Genomic distribution, intron-exon structure and structural motifs in the T. urticae UGTs were also described. In addition, expression profiling after host-plant shifts and in acaricide resistant lines supported an important role for UGT genes in xenobiotic metabolism. Expanded searches of UGTs in other arachnid species (Subphylum Chelicerata), including a spider, a scorpion, two ticks and two predatory mites, unexpectedly revealed the complete absence of UGT genes. However, a centipede (Subphylum Myriapoda) and a water flea and a crayfish (Subphylum Crustacea) contain UGT genes in their genomes similar to insect UGTs, suggesting that the UGT gene family might have been lost early in the Chelicerata lineage and subsequently re-gained in the tetranychid mites. Sequence similarity of T. urticae UGTs and bacterial UGTs and their phylogenetic reconstruction suggest that spider mites acquired UGT genes from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. Our findings show a unique evolutionary history of the T. urticae UGT gene family among other arthropods and provide important clues to its functions in relation to detoxification and thereby host adaptation.  "
negative,"[Progress in innate immunity-related genes in insects]. Insects have evolved a strong innate immune system to defense pathogens and adverse conditions. Insect innate immune system comprises of humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity mainly includes three signaling pathways, i.e., Toll, IMD and JAK / STAT, by which signal transduction and immune pathways regulate expression of immune-related genes and activate antimicrobial peptides and other effectors. Cellular immunity contains phagocytosis, encapsulation and nodulation of pathogens, which is mediated by hemolymph cells. In recent years, with the rapid development of insect genomics, a large number of immune-related genes have been characterized from insect genome data using bioinformatic methods. Studies on these genes have significantly deepened the understanding of molecular mechanisms of insect innate immune system. Insect immune-related genes can be divided into seven categories by gene functions: recognition, signaling transduction, modulator, effectors, melanization, RNA interference and other genes. The humoral immunity and cellular immunity are regulated by the interactions among these immune-related genes. In this review, we summarize the classification, function and evolution of insect immune-related genes, and propose future research directions of insect innate immunity, which will be helpful for understanding molecular mechanisms of insect innate immune system and developing new strategies for controlling pest insects. "
negative,"MicroRNA-2738 regulates gene expression in the sex determination pathway in Bombyx mori. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding transcripts that bind to 3'-untranslated regions to trigger messenger RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Here we explored how miRNAs regulate sex determination in Bombyx mori, a lepidopteran model insect. Genes known to be involved in sex determination, BmPSI, Bmdsx, and BmMasc, are predicted targets of the species-specific miR-2738. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells, we confirmed that miR-2738 suppressed transcription of BmPSI, Bmdsx, and BmMasc. The levels of BmPSI and BmMasc were significantly down-regulated in B. mori miR-2738 overexpression. In contrast, the genetic disruption of miR-2738 using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 transgenic system increased the levels of BmPSI and BmMasc transcripts, whereas splicing of Bmdsx was unaltered by miR-2738 depletion or overexpression. Taken together, this study implicates miR-2738 as a minor regulator of sex determination genes in the silkworm. "
negative,"Comparative genomic analysis of malaria mosquito vector-associated novel pathogen Elizabethkingia anophelis. Acquisition of Elizabethkingia infections in intensive care units (ICUs) has risen in the past decade. Treatment of Elizabethkingia infections is challenging due to the lack of effective therapeutic regimens, leading to a high mortality rate. Elizabethkingia infections have long been attributed to Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Recently, we used whole-genome sequencing to reveal that E. anophelis is the pathogenic agent for an Elizabethkingia outbreak at two ICUs. We performed comparative genomic analysis of seven hospital-isolated E. anophelis strains with five available Elizabethkingia spp. genomes deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Database. A pan-genomic approach was applied to identify the core- and pan-genome for the Elizabethkingia genus. We showed that unlike the hospital-isolated pathogen E. meningoseptica ATCC 12535 strain, the hospital-isolated E. anophelis strains have genome content and organization similar to the E. anophelis Ag1 and R26 strains isolated from the midgut microbiota of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. Both the core- and accessory genomes of Elizabethkingia spp. possess genes conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence. Our study highlights that E. anophelis is an emerging bacterial pathogen for hospital environments.  "
negative,"Development of a novel set of Gateway-compatible vectors for live imaging in insect cells. Insect genomics is a growing area of research. To exploit fully the genomic data that are being generated, high-throughput systems for the functional characterization of insect proteins and their interactomes are required. In this work, a Gateway-compatible vector set for expression of fluorescent fusion proteins in insect cells was developed. The vector set was designed to express a protein of interest fused to any of four different fluorescent proteins [green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and mCherry] by either the C-terminal or the N-terminal ends. Additionally, a collection of organelle-specific fluorescent markers was assembled for colocalization with fluorescent recombinant proteins of interest. Moreover, the vector set was proven to be suitable for simultaneously detecting up to three proteins by multiple labelling. The use of the vector set was exemplified by defining the subcellular distribution of Mal de Río Cuarto virus (MRCV) outer coat protein P10 and by analysing the in vivo self-interaction of the MRCV viroplasm matrix protein P9-1 in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. In conclusion, we have developed a valuable tool for high-throughput studies of protein subcellular localization that will aid in the elucidation of the function of newly described insect and virus proteins. "
negative,"Identification of a major Quantitative Trait Locus determining resistance to the organophosphate temephos in the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Organophosphate insecticides (OP) have extensively been used to control mosquitoes, such as the vector Aedes aegypti. Unfortunately, OP resistance has hampered control programs worldwide. We used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping to evaluate temephos resistance in two F1 intercross populations derived from crosses between a resistant Ae. aegypti strain (RecR) and two susceptible strains (MoyoD and Red). A single major effect QTL was identified on chromosome 2 of both segregating populations, named rtt1 (resistance to temephos 1). Bioinformatics analyses identified a cluster of carboxylesterase genes (CCE) within the rtt1 interval. qRT-PCR demonstrated that different CCEs were up-regulated in F2 resistant individuals from both crosses. However, none exceeded the 2-fold expression. Primary mechanisms for temephos resistance may vary between Ae. aegypti populations, yet also appear to support previous findings suggesting that multiple linked esterase genes may contribute to temephos resistance in the RecR strain as well as other populations. "
negative,"Impact of Insect Salivary Proteins in Blood Feeding, Host Immunity, Disease, and in the Development of Biomarkers for Vector Exposure. Functional genomic approaches based on expression of recombinant proteins linked to biochemical and disease model approaches resulted in the discovery of novel biological activities and the role some of these proteins play in disease transmission. Importantly, the expression of salivary proteins was recently shown to be affected by environmental factors and by the presence of the pathogen in the salivary gland. A practical application resulting from insect saliva research is the use of insect antigenic salivary protein as biomarkers of vector exposure in humans and animal reservoirs, an approach that is yielding interesting results in the field. "
negative,"Genome annotation and comparative analyses of the odorant-binding proteins and chemosensory proteins in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are two families of small water-soluble proteins, abundant in the aqueous fluid surrounding olfactory receptor neurons in insect antennae. OBPs are involved in the first step of olfactory signal transduction, carrying airborne semiochemicals to the odorant receptors and can be classified into three groups: Classic OBPs, Plus-C OBPs and Atypical OBPs. Here, we identified and annotated genes encoding putative OBPs and CSPs in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum using bioinformatics. This identified genes encoding 13 Classic and two Plus-C OBPs and 13 CSPs. Homologous OBP sequences were also identified in nine other aphid species, allowing us to compare OBPs across several aphid and non-aphid species. We show that, although OBP sequences are divergent within a species and between different orders, there is a high similarity between orthologs within a range of aphid species. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships between OBP orthologs reflect the divergence of aphid evolution lineages. Our results support the 'birth-and-death' model as the major mechanism explaining aphid OBP sequence evolution, with the main force acting on the evolution being purifying selection. "
negative,"A synthetic early promoter from a baculovirus: roles of the TATA box and conserved start site CAGT sequence in basal levels of transcription. Many baculovirus early genes and insect genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II have a conserved transcription start site sequence (CAGT) located downstream of a consensus TATA box. To examine the functions and interactions of these two motifs in initiating accurately positioned basal transcription, a 43-nt synthetic promoter was synthesized from the TATA box and start site sequences of the gp64 early promoter from the Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (OpMNPV). The synthetic promoter initiated accurately and was also transactivated by the baculovirus transcriptional activator, IE1. To determine the roles of sequences within the 43-nt synthetic promoter, a series of linker-scanning and spacing mutations were analyzed for transcriptional activity, start site selection, and transactivation. Linker-scanning mutations were examined in vivo by transient expression and reporter gene assays. To examine transcription start site selection, promoter constructs were used for in vitro transcription in nuclear extracts from uninfected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. In vivo and in vitro analyses show that the TATA box, and not the start site CAGT, is the primary element controlling start site selection. Substitution of the conserved start site CAGT sequence resulted in a reduction of both reporter gene activity and in vitro transcripts, although transcripts initiated accurately. Data from linker-scanning and spacing mutations indicate that the conserved start site CAGT sequences are not required for accurate initiation but sequences at the start site play an important role in initiation efficiency. "
negative,"Genome sequence of the insect pathogenic fungus Cordyceps militaris, a valued traditional Chinese medicine. BACKGROUND: Species in the ascomycete fungal genus Cordyceps have been proposed to be the teleomorphs of Metarhizium species. The latter have been widely used as insect biocontrol agents. Cordyceps species are highly prized for use in traditional Chinese medicines, but the genes responsible for biosynthesis of bioactive components, insect pathogenicity and the control of sexuality and fruiting have not been determined. RESULTS: Here, we report the genome sequence of the type species Cordyceps militaris. Phylogenomic analysis suggests that different species in the Cordyceps / Metarhizium genera have evolved into insect pathogens independently of each other, and that their similar large secretomes and gene family expansions are due to convergent evolution. However, relative to other fungi, including Metarhizium spp., many protein families are reduced in C. militaris, which suggests a more restricted ecology. Consistent with its long track record of safe usage as a medicine, the Cordyceps genome does not contain genes for known human mycotoxins. We establish that C. militaris is sexually heterothallic but, very unusually, fruiting can occur without an opposite mating-type partner. Transcriptional profiling indicates that fruiting involves induction of the Zn2Cys6-type transcription factors and MAPK pathway; unlike other fungi, however, the PKA pathway is not activated. CONCLUSIONS: The data offer a better understanding of Cordyceps biology and will facilitate the exploitation of medicinal compounds produced by the fungus. "
negative,"Genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp. strain HA, isolated from the gut of the polyphagous insect pest Helicoverpa armigera. In this study, Acinetobacter sp. strain HA was isolated from the midgut of a fifth-instar larva of Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we report the draft genome sequence (3,125,085 bp) of this strain that consists of 102 contigs, 2,911 predicted coding sequences, and a G+C content of 41%. "
positive,"Identification and functional characterization of an odorant receptor in pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The sensitive olfactory system is necessary for survival of insects. Odorant receptors (ORs) are located on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons and play a critical role in odor detection. Insect ORs are functionally analyzed via heterologous expression in a Xenopus oocyte system using a two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) electrophysiological recording. Here, we have identified a novel OR in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, then we cloned and named it ApisOR4. We analyzed the ApisOR4 tissue expression patterns and found expression only in antennae tissues. Further functional analysis using TEVC revealed that ApisOR4 is broadly tuned to eight volatiles, which elicit electrophysiological response in pea aphid antennae. This study provides an initial functional analysis of aphid ORs and identifies candidate volatiles to be used in developing new strategies for aphid control. "
positive,"Molecular features and expression profiles of octopamine receptors in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: Octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of adrenaline and noradrenaline, regulates and modulates many physiological and behavioral processes in insects. It mediates its effects by binding to specific octopamine receptors, which belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The expression profiles of octopamine receptor genes have been well documented in different developmental stages and multiple tissue types in several different insect orders. However, little work has addressed this issue in Hemiptera. RESULTS: In this study, we cloned four octopamine receptor genes from brown planthopper. The deduced amino acid sequences share high identity with other insect homologues and have the characteristic GPCRs domain architecture: seven transmembrane domains. These genes were expressed in all developmental stages and examined tissues. The expression of NlOA2B3 and NlOA3 was relatively higher in egg and first instar nymph stage than in other stages and other receptor genes. All of these receptor genes were more highly expressed in brain than other tissues. CONCLUSION: The identification of octopamine receptor genes in this study will provide a foundation for investigating the diverse roles played by NlOARs and for exploring specific target sites for chemicals that control agricultural pests. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Insecticide Exposure Triggers a Modulated Expression of ABC Transporter Genes in Larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Insecticides remain a main tool for the control of arthropod vectors. The urgency to prevent the insurgence of insecticide resistance and the perspective to find new target sites, for the development of novel molecules, are fuelling the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in insect defence against xenobiotic compounds. In this study, we have investigated if ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, a major component of the defensome machinery, are involved in defence against the insecticide permethrin, in susceptible larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Bioassays were performed with permethrin alone, or in combination with an ABC transporter inhibitor. Then we have investigated the expression profiles of five ABC transporter genes at different time points following permethrin exposure, to assess their expression patterns across time. The inhibition of ABC transporters increased the larval mortality by about 15-fold. Likewise, three genes were up-regulated after exposure to permethrin, showing different patterns of expression across the 48 h. Our results provide the first evidences of ABC transporters involvement in defence against a toxic in larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and show that the gene expression response is modulated across time, being continuous, but stronger at the earliest and latest times after exposure. "
positive,"Host-mediated RNA interference targeting a cuticular protein gene impaired fecundity in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests. This study demonstrated the potential of MyCP dsRNA in developing RNAi-based resistance to M. persicae. RNAi-mediated resistance is expected to be more durable compared with other transgenic strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Molecular cloning and characterization of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β subunit genes from Apis cerana cerana. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast cholinergic synaptic transmission in the insect nervous system and are important targets for insecticides. In this study, we identified and characterized two novel β subunit genes (Accβ1 and Accβ2) from Apis cerana cerana. Homology analysis indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess characteristics that are typical of nAChR subunits although Accβ2 was distinct from Accβ1 and the other nAChR subunits, due to its unusual transmembrane structure and uncommon exon-intron boundary within the genomic region encoding the TM1 transmembrane domain. Analysis of the 5' flanking regions indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess different regulatory elements, suggesting that the genes might exhibit various expression and regulatory patterns. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Accβ2 was expressed at a much higher level than Accβ1 in the tissues of adult bees. During development, Accβ1 was highly expressed at the pupal stages, whereas Accβ2 was abundantly expressed at the larval stages. Furthermore, Accβ1 and Accβ2 were both induced by exposure to various insecticides and environmental stresses although Accβ2 was more responsive than Accβ1. These results indicate that Accβ1 and Accβ2 may have distinct roles in insect growth and development and that they may belong to separate regulatory pathways involved in the response to insecticides and environmental stresses. This report is the first description of the differences between the nAChR β subunit genes in the Chinese honey bee and establishes an initial foundation for further study. "
negative,"Isolation and genomic characterization of Culex flaviviruses from mosquitoes in Myanmar. An entomological surveillance of arboviruses was conducted in Myanmar in 2014. A total of 8357 Culex mosquito vectors were collected in the Mandalay area and virus isolation was done by using the mosquito cell line C6 / 36 E2. A total of eighteen strains of Culex flavivirus (CxFV) were isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui and Cx. fuscocephala. Like other insect-specific flaviviruses, CxFV can replicate only in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells. These CxFV strains that were isolated in Japan from mosquitoes collected in Myanmar were closely related to the Wang Thong virus detected from Cx fusocephalus in Thailand and Cx.theileri flavivirus (CTFV) isolated from Cx. theileri mosquitoes in Portugal and Turkey. They encode a single open reading frame with 3357 amino acid residues. They have the characteristics of flaviviruses and have 95.62% amino acid identity with CTFV. This is the first report of CxFV in Myanmar with the characterized viral genome. This study illustrated that CxFV was circulating among the vectors of human pathogenic arboviruses in Myanmar but the impact of CxFV on other flaviviruses which are endemic in the study area still remains to be explored. "
negative,"Gene targeting and transgene stacking using intra genomic homologous recombination in plants. Modern agriculture has created a demand for plant biotechnology products that provide durable resistance to insect pests, tolerance of herbicide applications for weed control, and agronomic traits tailored for specific geographies. These transgenic trait products require a modular and sequential multigene stacking platform that is supported by precise genome engineering technology. Designed nucleases have emerged as potent tools for creating targeted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Exogenously supplied donor DNA can repair the targeted DSB by a process known as gene targeting (GT), resulting in a desired modification of the target genome. The potential of GT technology has not been fully realized for trait deployment in agriculture, mainly because of inefficient transformation and plant regeneration systems in a majority of crop plants and genotypes. This challenge of transgene stacking in plants could be overcome by Intra-Genomic Homologous Recombination (IGHR) that converts independently segregating unlinked donor and target transgenic loci into a genetically linked molecular stack. The method requires stable integration of the donor DNA into the plant genome followed by intra-genomic mobilization. IGHR complements conventional breeding with genetic transformation and designed nucleases to provide a flexible transgene stacking and trait deployment platform.  "
negative,"Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus from the Sudan and Iran: Sequence Comparisons and Identification of a Whitefly-Transmission Determinant. ABSTRACT The genomes of two Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV) isolates, one from the Sudan and one from Iran, were cloned and sequenced. Sequence relationship with other geminiviruses characterizes WmCSV as a typical Eastern Hemisphere geminivirus with a bipartite genome. The two geographically distant WmCSV isolates from Africa and the Middle East share a very high overall sequence similarity: 98% between their DNA-A and 96% between their DNA-B components, and their respective capsid proteins are identical. A single amino acid change in the capsid protein (N131D) renders WmCSV whitefly nontransmissible. This region of the capsid is also implicated in transmission by Bemisia tabaci of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus. "
negative,"RNA interference as a gene silencing tool to control Tuta absoluta in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). RNA interference (RNAi), a gene-silencing mechanism that involves providing double-stranded RNA molecules that match a specific target gene sequence, is now widely used in functional genetic studies. The potential application of RNAi-mediated control of agricultural insect pests has rapidly become evident. The production of transgenic plants expressing dsRNA molecules that target essential insect genes could provide a means of specific gene silencing in larvae that feed on these plants, resulting in larval phenotypes that range from loss of appetite to death. In this report, we show that the tomato leafminer ( Tuta absoluta ), a major threat to commercial tomato production, can be targeted by RNAi. We selected two target genes (Vacuolar ATPase-A and Arginine kinase) based on the RNAi response reported for these genes in other pest species. In view of the lack of an artificial diet for T. absoluta, we used two approaches to deliver dsRNA into tomato leaflets. The first approach was based on the uptake of dsRNA by leaflets and the second was based on ""in planta-induced transient gene silencing"" (PITGS), a well-established method for silencing plant genes, used here for the first time to deliver in planta-transcribed dsRNA to target insect genes. Tuta absoluta larvae that fed on leaves containing dsRNA of the target genes showed an ∼60% reduction in target gene transcript accumulation, an increase in larval mortality and less leaf damage. We then generated transgenic 'Micro-Tom' tomato plants that expressed hairpin sequences for both genes and observed a reduction in foliar damage by T. absoluta in these plants. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of RNAi as an alternative method for controlling this critical tomato pest. "
positive,"Hormonal control and target genes of ftz-f1 expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera: a positive loop linking juvenile hormone, ftz-f1, and vitellogenin. Ftz-f1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. A 20-hydroxyecdysone pulse allows ftz-f1 gene expression, which then regulates the activity of downstream genes involved in major developmental progression events. In honeybees, the expression of genes like vitellogenin (vg), prophenoloxidase and juvenile hormone-esterase during late pharate-adult development is known to be hormonally controlled in both queens and workers by increasing juvenile hormone (JH) titres in the presence of declining levels of ecdysteroids. Since Ftz-f1 is known for mediating intracellular JH signalling, we hypothesized that ftz-f1 could mediate JH action during the pharate-adult development of honeybees, thus controlling the expression of these genes. Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression. Finally, a double-repressor hypothesis-inspired vg gene knock-down experiment suggests the existence of a positive molecular loop between JH, ftz-f1 and vg. "
negative,"Efficient somatic and germline genome engineering of Bactrocera dorsalis by the CRISPR / Cas9 system. BACKGROUND: Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a very destructive insect pest of many fruits and vegetables, is widespread in many Asian countries. To facilitate control of this pest, it is essential to investigate its genetics and gene function using targeted gene disruption. RESULTS: Here, we describe successful targeted mutagenesis of the white and transformer genes in B. dorsalis through use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR / Cas9) system. Co-injection of the white sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA into B. dorsalis embryos caused eye color change, and the white mutations in the germline were heritable. CRISPR-mediated knockout of the sex determination gene transformer (tra) in B. dorsalis resulted in a male-biased sex ratio and adult flies with abnormal outer and interior reproductive organs. Small indels and substitutions were induced by CRIRPR for both genes. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that somatic and germline genome engineering of the pest B. dorsalis can be performed efficiently using the CRISPR / Cas9 system, opening the door to the use of the CRISPR-mediated method for functional annotations of genes in B. dorsalis and for its population control using, for example, such as gene drive. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Analysis of Homologs of Cry-toxin Receptor-Related Proteins in the Midgut of a Non-Bt Target, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens is one of the most destructive insect pests in the rice fields of Asia. Like other hemipteran insects, BPH is not susceptible to Cry toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or transgenic rice carrying Bt cry genes. Lack of Cry receptors in the midgut is one of the main reasons that BPH is not susceptible to the Cry toxins. The main Cry-binding proteins (CBPs) of the susceptible insects are cadherin, aminopeptidase N (APN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In this study, we analyzed and validated de novo assembled transcripts from transcriptome sequencing data of BPH to identify and characterize homologs of cadherin, APN, and ALP. We then compared the cadherin-, APN-, and ALP-like proteins of BPH to previously reported CBPs to identify their homologs in BPH. The sequence analysis revealed that at least one cadherin, one APN, and two ALPs of BPH contained homologous functional domains identified from the Cry-binding cadherin, APN, and ALP, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction used to verify the expression level of each putative Cry receptor homolog in the BPH midgut indicated that the CBPs homologous APN and ALP were expressed at high or medium-high levels while the cadherin was expressed at a low level. These results suggest that homologs of CBPs exist in the midgut of BPH. However, differences in key motifs of CBPs, which are functional in interacting with Cry toxins, may be responsible for insusceptibility of BPH to Cry toxins. "
negative,"Phylogenetic footprinting analysis in the upstream regulatory regions of the Drosophila enhancer of split genes. During Drosophila development Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]-dependent Notch activation upregulates transcription of the Enhancer of split-Complex [E(spl)-C] genes. Drosophila melanogaster E(spl) genes share common transcription regulators including binding sites for Su(H), proneural, and E(spl) basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. However, the expression patterns of E(spl) genes during development suggest that additional factors are involved. To better understand regulators responsible for these expression patterns, recently available sequence and annotation data for multiple Drosophila genomes were used to compare the E(spl) upstream regulatory regions from more than nine Drosophila species. The mgamma and mbeta regulatory regions are the most conserved of the bHLH genes. Fine analysis of Su(H) sites showed that high-affinity Su(H) paired sites and the Su(H) paired site plus proneural site (SPS + A) architecture are completely conserved in a subset of Drosophila E(spl) genes. The SPS + A module is also present in the upstream regulatory regions of the more ancient mosquito and honeybee E(spl) bHLH genes. Additional transcription factor binding sites were identified upstream of the E(spl) genes and compared between species of Drosophila. Conserved sites provide new understandings about E(spl) regulation during development. Conserved novel sequences found upstream of multiple E(spl) genes may play a role in the expression of these genes. "
negative,"Mode of action of nanoparticles against insects. The employment of nanoparticles obtained through various synthesis routes as novel pesticides recently attracted high research attention. An impressive number of studies have been conducted to test their toxic potential against a wide number of arthropod pests and vectors, with major emphasis on mosquitoes and ticks. However, precise information on the mechanisms of action of nanoparticles against insects and mites are limited, with the noteworthy exception of silica, alumina, silver, and graphene oxide nanoparticles on insects, while no information is available for mites. Here, I summarize current knowledge about the mechanisms of action of nanoparticles against insects. Both silver and graphene oxide nanoparticles have a significant impact on insect antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Ag nanoparticles also reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, while polystyrene nanoparticles inhibited CYP450 isoenzymes. Au nanoparticles can act as trypsin inhibitors and disrupt development and reproduction. Metal nanoparticles can bind to S and P in proteins and nucleic acids, respectively, leading to a decrease in membrane permeability, therefore to organelle and enzyme denaturation, followed by cell death. Besides, Ag nanoparticles up- and downregulate key insect genes, reducing protein synthesis and gonadotrophin release, leading to developmental damages and reproductive failure. The toxicity of SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles is due to their binding to the insect cuticle, followed by physico-sorption of waxes and lipids, leading to insect dehydration. In the final section, insect nanotoxicology research trends are critically discussed, outlining major challenges to predict the ecotoxicological consequences arising from the real-world use of nanoparticles as pesticides. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Anopheles minimus (Diptera: Culicidae) and the phylogenetics of known Anopheles mitogenomes. Anopheles minimus is an important vector of human malaria in southern China and Southeast Asia. The phylogenetics of mosquitoes has not been well resolved, and the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) has proven to be an important marker in the study of evolutionary biology. In this study, the complete mtgenome of An. minimus was sequenced for the first time. It is 15 395 bp long and encodes 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and a non-coding region. The gene organization is consistent with those of known Anopheles mtgenomes. The mtgenome performs a clear bias in nucleotide composition with a positive AT-skew and a negative GC-skew. All 13 PCGs prefer to use the codon UUA (Leu), ATN as initiation codon but cytochrome-oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and ND5, with TCG and GTG, and TAA as termination codon, but COI, COII, COIII and ND4, all with the incomplete T. tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, but tRNA(Ser(AGN)) is consistent with known Anopheles mtgenomes. The control region includes a conserved T-stretch and a (TA)n stretch, and has the highest A+T content at 93.1%. The phylogenetics of An. minimus with 18 other Anopheles species was constructed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, based on concatenated PCG sequences. The subgenera, Cellia and Anopheles, and Nyssorhynchus and Kerteszia have mutually close relationships, respectively. The Punctulatus group and Leucosphyrus group of Neomyzomyia Series, and the Albitarsis group of Albitarsis Series were suggested to be monophyletic. The monophyletic status of the subgenera, Cellia, Anopheles, Nyssorhynchus and Kerteszia need to be further elucidated.  "
negative,"Selective sweep of Wolbachia and parthenogenetic host genomes - the example of the weevil Eusomus ovulum. Most parthenogenetic weevil species are postulated to have originated via hybridization, but Wolbachia has also been speculated to play a role via the induction of parthenogenesis. Here, we examine the molecular diversity of Wolbachia and parthenogenetic host genomes. The host species studied here, Eusomus ovulum, is known to be exclusively parthenogenetic and triploid. The E. ovulum populations that we examined had a low genetic diversity of mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I gene) and nuclear markers (internal transcribed spacer 2 and elongation factor 1-α gene), and they all were infected by only single bacteria strains (genotyped for five genes according to the multilocus sequence typing system). We found significant signs of linkage disequilibrium and a lack of recombination amongst all of the examined genomes (bacteria and host), which strongly indicates a selective sweep. The lack of heterozygosity in host nuclear genes, missing bisexual populations and selective sweep between the parthenogenetic host and bacteria genomes suggest that parthenogenesis in this species could have originated as a result of infection rather than hybridization. However, the finding that highly similar Wolbachia strains are also present in other parthenogenetic weevils from the same habitat suggests the opposite scenario: bacteria may have infected the already parthenogenetic lineage and taken advantage of the host's unisexual reproduction. "
negative,"Genome-wide RIP-Chip analysis of translational repressor-bound mRNAs in the Plasmodium gametocyte. BACKGROUND: Following fertilization, the early proteomes of metazoans are defined by the translation of stored but repressed transcripts; further embryonic development relies on de novo transcription of the zygotic genome. During sexual development of Plasmodium berghei, a rodent model for human malaria species including P. falciparum, the stability of repressed mRNAs requires the translational repressors DOZI and CITH. When these repressors are absent, Plasmodium zygote development and transmission to the mosquito vector is halted, as hundreds of transcripts become destabilized. However, which mRNAs are direct targets of these RNA binding proteins, and thus subject to translational repression, is unknown. RESULTS: We identify the maternal mRNA contribution to post-fertilization development of P. berghei using RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis. We find that 731 mRNAs, approximately 50% of the transcriptome, are associated with DOZI and CITH, allowing zygote development to proceed in the absence of RNA polymerase II transcription. Using GFP-tagging, we validate the repression phenotype of selected genes and identify mRNAs relying on the 5' untranslated region for translational control. Gene deletion reveals a novel protein located in the ookinete crystalloid with an essential function for sporozoite development. CONCLUSIONS: Our study details for the first time the P. berghei maternal repressome. This mRNA population provides the developing ookinete with coding potential for key molecules required for life-cycle progression, and that are likely to be critical for the transmission of the malaria parasite from the rodent and the human host to the mosquito vector. "
negative,"Insect mitochondrial genomics 3: the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of representatives from two neuropteroid orders: a dobsonfly (order Megaloptera) and a giant lacewing and an owlfly (order Neuroptera). We describe the complete mitochondrial genomes from representatives of two orders of the Neuropterida: a dobsonfly, Corydalus cornutus (Megaloptera: Corydalidae, GenBank Accession No. FJ171323), a giant lacewing Polystoechotes punctatus (Neuroptera: Polystoechotidae, FJ171325), and an owlfly, Ascaloptynx appendiculatus (Neuroptera: Ascalaphidae, FJ171324). The dobsonfly sequence is 15,687 base pairs with a major noncoding (A+T rich) region of approximately 967 bp. The gene content and organization of the dobsonfly is identical to that of most insects. The giant lacewing sequence is 16 036 bp with a major noncoding region of about 1123 bp, while the owlfly sequence is 15,877 bp with a major noncoding region of about 1066 bp. The two Neuroptera sequences include a transposition of two tRNA genes, tRNATrp and tRNACys. These tRNA genes are coded on opposite strands and overlap by seven residues in the standard insect mitochondrial gene arrangement. Thus, the transposition required a duplication of at least the region of overlap. It is likely that the transposition occurred by a duplication of both genes followed by deletion of one copy of each gene. Examination of this region in two other neuropteroid species, a snakefly, Agulla sp. (Raphidioptera: Raphidiidae), and an antlion, Myrmeleon immaculatus (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), shows that the rearrangement is widespread in the order Neuroptera but not present in either of the other two orders of Neuropterida. "
negative,"A maturing understanding of the composition of the insect gene repertoire. Recent insect genome sequencing initiatives have dramatically accelerated the accumulation of genomics data resources sampling species from different lineages to explore the incredible diversity of insect biology. These efforts have built a comprehensive catalogue of the insect gene repertoire, which is expanded with each newly-sequenced genome and continually refined using knowledge from cross-species comparisons and new sources of evidence. Since the sequencing of the very first insect genomes, comparative analyses have identified shared (homologous) and equivalent (orthologous) genes, as well as subsets of genes that appear to be unique. With the number of available insect genomes fast approaching one hundred, a maturing understanding of the composition of the insect gene repertoire broadly partitions it into an expected core of universally-present orthologues and a diverse array of lineage-specific and species-specific genes. While homology and orthology help to build evolutionarily-informed functional hypotheses for many genes from these newly-sequenced genomes, experimental interrogations are required to test such hypotheses and to probe the functions of genes for which homology offers no clues. Such taxonomically-restricted genes may represent the current contents of an evolutionary melting pot, out of which novel adaptations have emerged to make insects the most successful group of animals on Earth. "
negative,"A mutation in the PSST homologue of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) from Tetranychus urticae is associated with resistance to METI acaricides. The acaricidal compounds pyridaben, tebufenpyrad and fenpyroximate are frequently used in the control of phytophagous mites such as Tetranychus urticae, and are referred to as Mitochondrial Electron Transport Inhibitors, acting at the quinone binding pocket of complex I (METI-I acaricides). Because of their very frequent use, resistance evolved fast more than 20 years ago, and is currently wide-spread. Increased activity of P450 monooxygenases has been often associated with resistance, but target-site based resistance mechanisms were never reported. Here, we report the discovery of a mutation (H92R) in the PSST homologue of complex I in METI-I resistant T. urticae strains. The position of the mutation was studied using the high-resolution crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus, and was located in a stretch of amino acids previously photo-affinity labeled by fenpyroximate. Selection experiments with a strain segregating for the mutant allele, together with marker-assisted back-crossing of the mutation in a susceptible background, confirmed the involvement of the mutation in METI-I resistance. Additionally, an independent genetic mapping approach; QTL analysis identified the genomic region of pyridaben resistance, which included the PSST gene. Last, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools to introduce the mutation in the Drosophila PSST homologue. "
negative,"Distal-less homeobox genes of insects and spiders: genomic organization, function, regulation and evolution. The Distal-less (Dll) genes are homeodomain transcription factors that are present in most Metazoa and in representatives of all investigated arthropod groups. In Drosophila, the best studied insect, Dll plays an essential role in forming the proximodistal axis of the legs, antennae and analia, and in specifying antennal identity. The initiation of Dll expression in clusters of cells in mid-lateral regions of the Drosophila embryo represents the earliest genetic marker of limbs. Dll genes are involved in the development of the peripheral nervous system and sensitive organs, and they also function as master regulators of black pigmentation in some insect lineages. Here we analyze the complete genomes of six insects, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens, as well as multiple Dll sequences available in databases in order to examine the structure and protein features of these genes. We also review the function, expression, regulation and evolution of arthropod Dll genes with emphasis on insects and spiders.  "
negative,"Gene expression in gut symbiotic organ of stinkbug affected by extracellular bacterial symbiont. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris possesses a specialized symbiotic organ in a posterior region of the midgut, where numerous crypts harbor extracellular betaproteobacterial symbionts of the genus Burkholderia. Second instar nymphs orally acquire the symbiont from the environment, and the symbiont infection benefits the host by facilitating growth and by occasionally conferring insecticide resistance. Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in symbiotic and non-symbiotic regions of the midgut dissected from Burkholderia-infected and uninfected R. pedestris. Expression sequence tag analysis of cDNA libraries and quantitative reverse transcription PCR identified a number of insect genes expressed in symbiosis- or aposymbiosis-associated patterns. For example, genes up-regulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals, including many cysteine-rich secreted protein genes and many cathepsin protease genes, are likely to play a role in regulating the symbiosis. Conversely, genes up-regulated in aposymbiotic relative to symbiotic individuals, including a chicken-type lysozyme gene and a defensin-like protein gene, are possibly involved in regulation of non-symbiotic bacterial infections. Our study presents the first transcriptomic data on gut symbiotic organ of a stinkbug, which provides initial clues to understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the insect-bacterium gut symbiosis and sheds light on several intriguing commonalities between endocellular and extracellular symbiotic associations. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the Orange Hairstreak Japonica lutea (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclinae). The complete mitochondrial genome of Japonica lutea is 15,225 bp in length, containing 37 typical insect genes: 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a non-coding AT-rich region. All the 13 PCGs are initiated with ATN, except for COI gene which is started by CGA. Nine PCGs use the complete termination codon (TAN), whereas the COI, COII, ND4 and ND5 genes end with single nucleotide T. In total, 131 bp intergenic spacers and 31 bp overlapping sequences are interspersed throughout the whole genome. The two rRNA genes (lrRNA and srRNA) are 1327 bp and 770 bp in size, with their AT contents of 87.8% and 85.5%, respectively. All tRNAs display typical secondary cloverleaf structures except for tRNASer(AGN) which loses the DHU arm. The 401 bp long AT-rich region contains several features characteristic of the lepidopterans, such as the ATAGA motif followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, a microsatellite-like (AT)7 element preceded by the ATTTA motif and a 9 bp poly-A stretch.

positive,"Genome-wide analysis of Notch signalling in Drosophila by transgenic RNAi. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens have identified near-complete sets of genes involved in cellular processes. However, this methodology has not yet been used to study complex developmental processes in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report the use of a library of Drosophila strains expressing inducible hairpin RNAi constructs to study the Notch signalling pathway during external sensory organ development. We assigned putative loss-of-function phenotypes to 21.2% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes. Using secondary assays, we identified 6 new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and 23 novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway. By integrating our phenotypic results with protein interaction data, we constructed a genome-wide, functionally validated interaction network governing Notch signalling and asymmetric cell division. We used clustering algorithms to identify nuclear import pathways and the COP9 signallosome as Notch regulators. Our results show that complex developmental processes can be analysed on a genome-wide level and provide a unique resource for functional annotation of the Drosophila genome. "
negative,"Comparative analysis of two phenologically divergent populations of the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) by de novo transcriptome sequencing. The pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa is a Mediterranean lepidopteran defoliator that experiences a rapid range expansion towards higher latitudes and altitudes due to the current climate warming. Its phenology - the time of sexual reproduction - is certainly a key trait for the local adaptation of the processionary moth to climatic conditions. Moreover, an exceptional case of allochronic differentiation was discovered ca. 15 years ago in this species. A population with a shifted phenology (the summer population, SP) co-exists near Leiria, Portugal, with a population following the classical cycle (the winter population, WP). The existence of this population is an outstanding opportunity to decipher the genetic bases of phenology. No genomic resources were so far available for T. pityocampa. We developed a high-throughput sequencing approach to build a first reference transcriptome, and to proceed with comparative analyses of the sympatric SP and WP. We pooled RNA extracted from whole individuals of various developmental stages, and performed a transcriptome characterisation for both populations combining Roche 454-FLX and traditional Sanger data. The obtained sequences were clustered into ca. 12,000 transcripts corresponding to 9265 unigenes. The mean transcript coverage was 21.9 reads per bp. Almost 70% of the de novo assembled transcripts displayed significant similarity to previously published proteins and around 50% of the transcripts contained a full-length coding region. Comparative analyses of the population transcriptomes allowed to investigate genes specifically expressed in one of the studied populations only, and to identify the most divergent homologous SP / WP transcripts. The most divergent pairs of transcripts did not correspond to obvious phenology-related candidate genes, and 43% could not be functionally annotated. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide resource for the target species T. pityocampa. Many of the assembled genes are orthologs of published Lepidoptera genes, which allows carrying out gene-specific re-sequencing. Data mining has allowed the identification of SNP loci that will be useful for population genomic approaches and genome-wide scans of population differentiation to identify signatures of selection.

negative,"Insect and plant-derived miRNAs in greenbug (Schizaphis graminum) and yellow sugarcane aphid (Sipha flava) revealed by deep sequencing. Schizaphis graminum (green bug; GB) and Sipha flava (yellow sugarcane aphid; YSA) are two cereal aphid species with broad host ranges capable of establishing on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and several switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) cultivars. Switchgrass and sorghum are staple renewable bioenergy crops that are vulnerable to damage by aphids, therefore, identifying novel targets to control aphids has the potential to drastically improve yields and reduce losses in these bioenergy crops. Despite the wealth of genomic and transcriptomic information available from a closely related model aphid species, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), similar genomic information, including the identification of small RNAs, is still limited for GB and YSA. Deep sequencing of miRNAs expressed in GB and YSA was conducted and 72 and 56 miRNA candidates (including 14 and eight novel) were identified, respectively. Of the identified miRNAs, 45 were commonly expressed in both aphid species. Further, plant derived miRNAs were also detected in both aphid samples, including 13 (eight known and five novel) sorghum miRNAs and three (novel) barley miRNAs. In addition, potential aphid gene targets for the host plant-derived miRNAs were predicted. The establishment of miRNA repertoires in these two aphid species and the detection of plant-derived miRNA in aphids will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression networks in these two aphids and the potential roles of plant miRNAs in mediating plant-insect interactions. "
negative,"Discovery and initial analysis of novel viral genomes in the soybean cyst nematode. Nematodes are the most abundant multicellular animals on earth, yet little is known about their natural viral pathogens. To date, only two nematode virus genomes have been reported. Consequently, nematode viruses have been overlooked as important biotic factors in the study of nematode ecology. Here, we show that one plant parasitic nematode species, Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), harbours four different RNA viruses. The nematode virus genomes were discovered in the SCN transcriptome after high-throughput sequencing and assembly. All four viruses have negative-sense RNA genomes, and are distantly related to nyaviruses and bornaviruses, rhabdoviruses, bunyaviruses and tenuiviruses. Some members of these families replicate in and are vectored by insects, and can cause significant diseases in animals and plants. The novel viral sequences were detected in both eggs and the second juvenile stage of SCN, suggesting that these viruses are transmitted vertically. While there was no evidence of integration of viral sequences into the nematode genome, we indeed detected transcripts from these viruses by using quantitative PCR. These data are the first finding of virus genomes in parasitic nematodes. This discovery highlights the need for further exploration for nematode viruses in all tropic groups of these diverse and abundant animals, to determine how the presence of these viruses affects the fitness of the nematode, strategies of viral transmission and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Laodelphax striatellus, the small brown planthopper (SBPH), is an economically important pest, besides sucking damage, which transmits rice viruses to cause severe damages to rice. In the process of virus transmission, the host orientation behavior of insect is mainly driven by olfaction. In this context, the molecular basis of olfaction in SBPH is of particular interest. RESULTS: Here, we identified the gene that encodes olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) and analyzed its expression profiles in Rice stripe virus (RSV)-infected and RSV-free SBPH. It was found that LstrOrco shared high identity with other Orcos from different order insects. LstrOrco was mainly expressed in the head of SBPH, and its expression was significantly stimulated by RSV-infection. The behavioral bioassay revealed that viruliferous SBPH might have a stronger olfactory and seeking ability for rice than RSV-free insect. After silencing of LstrOrco expression, the olfaction and seeking behavior of nymphs for rice seedlings was significantly inhibited, mainly in the increase of the 'no response' percent and the prolongation of the response time. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that Orco played an important role in olfactory signaling and seeking behavior of SBPH, which provided a basic for future development of olfactory-based agriculture pest management strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Extensive gene amplification and concerted evolution within the CPR family of cuticular proteins in mosquitoes. Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae genome has revealed a large increase in the number of genes encoding cuticular proteins with the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus (the CPR gene family) relative to Drosophila melanogaster. This increase reflects an expansion of the RR-2 group of CPR genes, particularly the amplification of sets of highly similar paralogs. Patterns of nucleotide variation indicate that extensive concerted evolution is occurring within these clusters. The pattern of concerted evolution is complex, however, as sequence similarity within clusters is uncorrelated with gene order and orientation, and no comparable clusters occur within similarly compact arrays of the RR-1 group in mosquitoes or in either group in D. melanogaster. The dearth of pseudogenes suggests that sequence clusters are maintained by selection for high gene-copy number, perhaps due to selection for high expression rates. This hypothesis is consistent with the apparently parallel evolution of compact gene architectures within sequence clusters relative to single-copy genes. We show that RR-2 proteins from sequence-cluster genes have complex repeats and extreme amino-acid compositions relative to single-copy CPR proteins in An. gambiae, and that the amino-acid composition of the N-terminal and C-terminal sequence flanking the chitin-binding consensus region evolves in a correlated fashion. "
negative,"Disruptions of the genes involved in lysine biosynthesis, iron acquisition, and secondary metabolisms affect virulence and fitness in Metarhizium robertsii. Based on genomic analysis, polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways account for biosynthesis of the majority of the secondary metabolites produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii. To evaluate the contribution of these pathways to M. robertsii fitness and / or virulence, mutants deleted for mrpptA, the Sfp-type 4' phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene required for their activation were generated. ΔmrpptA strains were deficient in PKS and NRPS activity resulting in colonies that lacked the typical green pigment and failed to produce the nonribosomal peptides (destruxins, serinocylins, and the siderophores ferricrocin and metachelins) as well as the hybrid polyketide-peptides (NG-39x) that are all produced by the wild type (WT) M. robertsii. The ΔmrpptA colonies were also auxotrophic for lysine. Two other mutant strains were generated: ΔmraarA, in which the α-aminoadipate reductase gene critical for lysine biosynthesis was disrupted, and ΔmrsidA, in which the L-ornithine N5-oxygenase gene that is critical for hydroxamate siderophore biosynthesis was disrupted. The phenotypes of these mutants were compared to those of ΔmrpptA to separate effects of the loss of lysine or siderophore production from the overall effect of losing all polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide production. Loss of lysine biosynthesis marginally increased resistance to H2O2 while it had little effect on the sensitivity to the cell wall disruptor sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and no effect on sensitivity to iron deprivation. In contrast, combined loss of metachelin and ferricrocin through the inactivation of mrsidA resulted in mutants that were as hypersensitive or slightly more sensitive to H2O2, iron deprivation, and SDS, and were either identical or marginally higher in ΔmrpptA strains. In contrast to ΔmrpptA, loss of mrsidA did not completely abolish siderophore activity, which suggests the production of one or more non-hydroxamate iron-chelating compounds. Deletion of mrpptA, mrsidA, and mraarA reduced conidium production and conidia of a GFP-tagged ΔmrpptA strain displayed a longer germination delay than WT on insect cuticles, a deficiency that was rescued by lysine supplementation. Compared with WT, ΔmrpptA strains displayed ∼19-fold reduction in virulence against Drosophila suzukii. In contrast, lysine auxotrophy and loss of siderophores accounted for ∼2 and ∼6-fold decreases in virulence, respectively. Deletion of mrpptA had no significant effect on growth inhibition of Bacillus cereus. Our results suggest that PKS and NRPS metabolism plays a significant role in M. robertsii virulence, depresses conidium production, and contributes marginally to resistance to oxidative stress and iron homeostasis, but has no significant antibacterial effect. "
positive,"Silencing a sugar transporter gene reduces growth and fecundity in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, sugar transporter gene 6 (Nlst6) is a facilitative glucose / fructose transporter (often called a passive carrier) expressed in midgut that mediates sugar transport from the midgut lumen to hemolymph. The influence of down regulating expression of sugar transporter genes on insect growth, development, and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suspect that transporter-mediated uptake of dietary sugar is essential to the biology of phloem-feeding insects. Based on this reasoning, we posed the hypothesis that silencing, or reducing expression, of a BPH sugar transporter gene would be deleterious to the insects. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of Nlst6 knockdown on BPH biology. Reducing expression of Nlst6 led to profound effects on BPHs. It significantly prolonged the pre-oviposition period, shortened the oviposition period, decreased the number of eggs deposited and reduced body weight, compared to controls. Nlst6 knockdown also significantly decreased fat body and ovarian (particularly vitellogenin) protein content as well as vitellogenin gene expression. Experimental BPHs accumulated less fat body glucose compared to controls. We infer that Nlst6 acts in BPH growth and fecundity, and has potential as a novel target gene for control of phloem-feeding pest insects.  "
negative,"Volatile signaling in plant-plant interactions: ""talking trees"" in the genomics era. Plants may ""eavesdrop"" on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by herbivore-attacked neighbors to activate defenses before being attacked themselves. Transcriptome and signal cascade analyses of VOC-exposed plants suggest that plants eavesdrop to prime direct and indirect defenses and to hone competitive abilities. Advances in research on VOC biosynthesis and perception have facilitated the production of plants that are genetically ""deaf"" to particular VOCs or ""mute"" in elements of their volatile vocabulary. Such plants, together with advances in VOC analytical instrumentation, will allow researchers to determine whether fluency enhances the fitness of plants in natural communities. "
negative,"A draft genome assembly of the army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda. Spodoptera is an agriculturally important pest insect and studies in understanding its biology have been limited by the unavailability of its genome. In the present study, the genomic DNA was sequenced and assembled into 37,243 scaffolds of size, 358 Mb with N50 of 53.7 kb. Based on degree of identity, we could anchor 305 Mb of the genome onto all the 28 chromosomes of Bombyx mori. Repeat elements were identified, which accounts for 20.28% of the total genome. Further, we predicted 11,595 genes, with an average intron length of 726 bp. The genes were annotated and domain analysis revealed that Sf genes share a significant homology and expression pattern with B. mori, despite differences in KOG gene categories and representation of certain protein families. The present study on Sf genome would help in the characterization of cellular pathways to understand its biology and comparative evolutionary studies among lepidopteran family members to help annotate their genomes. "
negative,"The chromosomes of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae): detailed photographic polytene chromosomal maps and in situ hybridization data. The spotted wing drosophila, D. suzukii, is a serious agricultural pest attacking a variety of soft fruits and vegetables. Although originating from East Asia it has recently invaded America and Europe raising major concern about its expansion potential and the consequent economic losses. Since cytogenetic information on the species is scarce, we report here the mitotic karyotype and detailed photographic maps of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of D. suzukii. The mitotic metaphase complement contains three pairs of autosomes, one of which is dot-like, and one pair of heteromorphic (XX / XY) sex chromosomes. The salivary gland polytene complement consists of five long polytene arms, representing the two metacentric autosomes and the acrocentric X chromosome, and one very short polytene element, which corresponds to the dot-like autosome. Banding pattern as well as the most characteristic features and prominent landmarks of each polytene chromosome arm are presented and discussed. Furthermore, twelve gene markers have been mapped on the polytene chromosomes of D. suzukii by in situ hybridization. Their distribution pattern was found quite similar to that of D. melanogaster revealing conservation of synteny although the relative position within each chromosome arm for most of the genes differed significantly between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster. The chromosome information presented here is suitable for comparative cytogenetic studies and phylogenetic exploration, while it could also facilitate the assembly of the genome sequence and support the development of genetic tools for species-specific and environment-friendly biological control applications such as the sterile insect technique. "
negative,"An insect trypsin-like serine protease as a target of microRNA: utilization of microRNA mimics and inhibitors by oral feeding. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs (18-25 nt) that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including development, as gene regulators. In this study, we identified a miRNA, har-miR-2002b, that is specifically expressed during larval stages of Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm). For the first time, we explored the possibility of utilizing synthetic inhibitor and mimic of a miRNA by oral feeding and confirmed that the inhibitor and mimic can successfully inhibit / oversupply har-miR-2002b in H. armigera larvae. Bioassays by oral feeding indicated 70% reduction in fecundity and 40% larval mortality in the presence of har-miR-2002b mimic. In addition, a large proportion of those larvae that made it to the pupal stage were deformed and only few moths emerged from them. This implied an important role of har-miR-2002b in larval development and adult fecundity. A trypsin-like serine protease (Ha-TLP) was identified as a target of har-miR-2002b. In vivo and in vitro studies revealed that in the presence of the miRNA mimic Ha-TLP transcript / protein levels and enzyme activity were significantly reduced. In contrast, inhibition of har-miR-2002b led to significant up-regulation of Ha-TLP transcript levels. This is the first study which shows the potential of utilization of miRNA mimics and inhibitors in pest control by targeting specific insect genes. "
negative,"Species-specific expansion of C2H2 zinc-finger genes and their expression profiles in silkworm, Bombyx mori. Most C2H2 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) function as sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, and play important roles in a variety of biology processes, such as development, differentiation, and tumor suppression. By searching the silkworm genome with a HMM model of C2H2 zinc-fingers, we have identified a total of 338 C2H2 ZFPs. Most of the ZFP genes were clustered on chromosomes and showed uneven distribution in the genome. Over one third of genes were concentrated on chromosome 11, 15 and 24. Phylogenetic analysis classified all silkworm C2H2 ZFPs into 75 families; 63 of which belong to evolutionarily conserved families. In addition, 188 C2H2 ZFP genes (55.6%) are species-specific to the silkworm. A species-specific expansion of a family with 39 members in a tandem array on chromosome 24 may explain the higher number of species-specific ZFPs in silkworm compared to other organisms. The expression patterns of C2H2 ZFP genes were also examined by microarray analysis. Most of these genes were actively expressed among different tissues on day 3 of the fifth instar. The results provide insight into the biological functions of the silkworm C2H2 ZFP genes in metamorphism and development. "
negative,"A case for sequencing the genome of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae). House flies are carriers of >100 devastating diseases that have severe consequences for human and animal health. Despite the fact that it is a passive vector, a key bottleneck to progress in controlling the human diseases transmitted by house flies is lack of knowledge of the basic molecular biology of this species. Sequencing of the house fly genome will provide important inroads to the discovery of novel target sites for house fly control, understanding of the house fly immune response, rapid elucidation of insecticide resistance genes, and understanding of numerous aspects of the basic biology of this insect pest. The ability of the house fly to prosper in a remarkably septic environment motivates analysis of its innate immune system. Its polymorphic sex determination system, with male-determining factors on either the autosomes or the Y chromosome, is ripe for a genomic analysis. Sequencing of the house fly genome would allow the first opportunity to study the interactions between a pest insect and its parasitoid (Nasonia vitripennis) at the whole genome level. In addition, the house fly is well placed phylogenetically to leverage analysis of the multiple Dipteran genomes that have been sequenced (including several mosquito and Drosophila species). The community of researchers investigating Musca domestica are well prepared and highly motivated to apply genomic analyses to their widely varied research programs. "
negative,"A new versatile gene-trap vector for insect transgenics. A new piggyBac-based gene-trap vector, pB-GT1, was constructed. pB-GT1 contains three marker genes, dsRed, Gal4, and EGFP. dsRed is under the control of the constitutive 3xP3 promoter, which induces dsRed expression wherever the vector is inserted in the host genome. The Gal4 sequence has no promoter but is preceded by the splice acceptor site so that it can be transcribed as a transcript fused with the host exon 5' to the insertion site. EGFP is driven by the constitutive ie+hr promoter but lacks a poly(A)(+) signal sequence, and thus the EGFP expression is detectable only when its transcript is fused with the host exon 3' downstream of the insertion. By the microinjection of the vector into fertilized eggs, we obtained transgenic Drosophila with a single copy of pB-GT1, which was inserted into the first intron of the ovo gene. The female flies of this transgenic line are sterile, indicating that the insertion inactivated the ovo gene, generating a new allele of this locus, ovo(pB-GT1). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that an ovo-Gal4-fusion transcript is produced in ovo(pB-GT1) flies. The fact that UAS-EGFP reporter expression was detected in ovo(pB-GT1) germ cells in a pattern similar to that reported for wild-type ovo indicates that functional Gal4 is expressed via pB-GT1, recapitulating the endogenous expression pattern of the trapped gene. pB-GT1 is thus useful in insect genomics for the efficient assignment of functions of individual genes. "
positive,"Carboxylesterase genes in pyrethroid resistant house flies, Musca domestica. Carboxylesterases are one of the major enzyme families involved in the detoxification of pyrethroids. Up-regulation of carboxylesterase genes is thought to be a major component of insecticide resistant mechanisms in insects. Based on the house fly transcriptome and genome database, a total of 39 carboxylesterase genes of different functional clades have been identified in house flies. In this study, eleven of these genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in the resistant ALHF house fly strain compared with susceptible aabys and wild-type CS strains. Eight up-regulated carboxylesterase genes with their expression levels were further induced to a higher level in response to permethrin treatments, indicating that constitutive and inductive overexpression of carboxylesterases are co-responsible for the enhanced detoxification of insecticides. Spatial expression studies revealed these up-regulated genes to be abundantly distributed in fat bodies and genetically mapped on autosome 2 or 3 of house flies, and their expression could be regulated by factors on autosome 1, 2 and 5. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multiple carboxylesterase genes are co-upregulated in resistant house flies, providing further evidence for their involvement in the detoxification of insecticides and development of insecticide resistance. "
positive,"Molecular characterization of an NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase from Bemisia tabaci Q: Potential involvement in susceptibility to imidacloprid. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is an integral component of cytochrome P450-mediated biological reactions, such as the metabolism of xenobiotics, including insecticides. CPR has been reported to be associated with insecticide tolerance in several insects. However, the biochemical characteristics and biological function of CPR in Bemisia tabaci Q (BtCPR) remain undefined. In this study, BtCPR was cloned, and bioinformatic analysis showed that BtCPR is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight (MW) of 76.73 kDa and contains conserved binding domains (FMN, FAD, and NADPH). Tissue- and developmental stage-dependent expression indicated that the highest expression levels of BtCPR occurred in head tissue and in male adults. Transcripts of BtCPR in the field B. tabaci Q strain were 1.62-fold higher than those of the laboratory B. tabaci Q strain. In both field and laboratory adults, the susceptibility of BtCPR-knockdown B. tabaci Q to imidacloprid substantially increased compared to that of the B. tabaci Q control group. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of BtCPR in Sf9 cells exhibited catalytic activity for cytochrome c reduction, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Sf9 cells overexpressing BtCPR had greater viability than the control cells when treated with imidacloprid. The results suggest that BtCPR could affect the susceptibility of B. tabaci Q to imidacloprid and could also be considered a novel target for pest control. "
negative,"Evaluation of DNA barcoding and identification of new haplomorphs in Canadian deerflies and horseflies. This paper reports the first tests of the suitability of the standardized mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding system for the identification of Canadian deerflies and horseflies. Two additional mitochondrial molecular markers were used to determine whether unambiguous species recognition in tabanids can be achieved. Our 332 Canadian tabanid samples yielded 650 sequences from five genera and 42 species. Standard COI barcodes demonstrated a strong A + T bias (mean 68.1%), especially at third codon positions (mean 93.0%). Our preliminary test of this system showed that the standard COI barcode worked well for Canadian Tabanidae: the target DNA can be easily recovered from small amounts of insect tissue and aligned for all tabanid taxa. Each tabanid species possessed distinctive sets of COI haplotypes which discriminated well among species. Average conspecific Kimura two-parameter (K2P) divergence (0.49%) was 12 times lower than the average divergence within species. Both the neighbour-joining and the Bayesian methods produced trees with identical monophyletic species groups. Two species, Chrysops dawsoni Philip and Chrysops montanus Osten Sacken (Diptera: Tabanidae), showed relatively deep intraspecific sequence divergences (∼ 10 times the average) for all three mitochondrial gene regions analysed. We suggest provisional differentiation of Ch. montanus into two haplotypes, namely, Ch. montanus haplomorph 1 and Ch. montanus haplomorph 2, both defined by their molecular sequences and by newly discovered differences in structural features near their ocelli. "
negative,"A large-scale gene discovery for the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The red palm weevil (RPW; Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) is a devastating pest of palms, prevalent in the Middle East as well as many other regions of the world. Here, we report a large-scale de novo complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing effort that acquired ∼5 million reads and assembled them into 26 765 contigs from 12 libraries made from samples of different RPW developmental stages based on the Roche / 454 GS FLX platform. We annotated these contigs based on the publically available known insect genes and the Tribolium castaneum genome assembly. We find that over 80% of coding sequences (CDS) from the RPW contigs have high-identity homologs to known proteins with complete CDS. Gene expression analysis shows that the pupa and larval stages have the highest and lowest expression levels, respectively. In addition, we also identified more than 60 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 1 200 simple sequence repeat markers. This study provides the first large-scale cDNA dataset for RPW, a much-needed resource for future molecular studies.  "
negative,"Molecular evidence for similarity between Anopheles hyrcanus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Anopheles pseudopictus (Diptera: Culicidae), sympatric potential vectors of malaria in France. Malaria was a former public health problem in the Camargue, southeastern France, where members of the Hyrcanus group were recently described as the main malaria potential vectors. However, the systematic status in this group, which includes at least two sympatric sibling species, Anopheles hyrcanus (Pallas) and Anopheles pseudopictus Grassi as well as a morphologically intermediate form in the Camargue, is unclear. Indeed, both species have been alternatively considered as separated or synonymous species. We examined sequence variation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 and domain-3 (D3) of 28S ribosomal DNA and the cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II (COI and COII) genes of mitochondrial DNA of the Hyrcanus group mosquitoes from the Camargue and Turkey to infer the taxonomic status of the members of this group. DNA sequence analysis of ITS2 and D3 showed no difference between either species or geographical origin (mean pairwise genetic distances d = 0.000-0.003). The COI and COII sequences between French specimens also were nearly identical (d = 0.001-0.002), whereas French and Turkish Anopheles were genetically distinct (d = 0.009-0.014). The distinction between populations of the two areas, supported, respectively, by four and five fixed mutations, attested the differentiation by the distance. Finally, the high degree of genetic similarity, despite morphological differences between An. hyrcanus, An. pseudopictus, and an intermediate form, suggests that these three taxa may belong to a single species in the Camargue. "
negative,"Genomic organization and developmental pattern of expression of the engrailed gene from the brine shrimp Artemia. We report the isolation and characterization of an engrailed gene in the crustacean Artemia franciscana. The Artemia gene spans a genomic region of 15 kilobases and the coding sequence is interrupted by two introns. It appears to be the only gene of the engrailed family present in the Artemia genome. The predicted engrailed-like protein is 349 amino acids long and contains several domains including the homeodomain, well conserved when compared to other proteins of the engrailed family. Based on sequence comparisons we have detected, in the Artemia engrailed protein, several features which are in common with the Drosophila and Bombyx engrailed proteins. It also has some features specific for invected proteins. Therefore, this gene appears to have diverged from an ancestral gene common to both the engrailed and invected insect genes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments show that the expression of this gene in postembryonic development of Artemia is restricted to the posterior part of at least the thoracic and maxillary segments. The pattern is generated sequentially from a growth zone organized in columns of cells close to the caudal region of the larvae. Cell proliferation in the growth zone follows an interspersed pattern without evidence of early lineage restrictions. The engrailed expression is detected in the growth zone before any segmentation is visible and continues to be expressed in a posterior location in the segments that are morphologically defined. Initially expressed in isolated cells, it spreads into rows broadening to two-three cells as segments mature. The evidence presented here is compatible with the hypothesis that intercellular signaling mechanisms are in part responsible of the early activation of selector genes. "
positive,"Identification and Expression Profiling of Odorant Receptor Protein Genes in Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) Using RT-qPCR. This study aimed to identify ORs (odorant receptors) and Orco (odorant receptor coreceptor) genes in Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea), to explore the relative expression levels of these genes in different adult tissues and obtain information on highly expressed receptor proteins. Putative OR and Orco genes were identified from transcriptomic data previously obtained for S. zeamais using bioinformatics methods. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare the differences in expression in seven adult tissues (male antennae, female antennae, heads, thoraxes, abdomens, wings, and legs). The candidate OR and Orco gene sequences were analyzed, and the protein physicochemical properties were predicted. We identified 64 OR genes including the Orco gene. Forty-seven OR genes, including Orco, were over expressed in male or female antennae. Seventeen OR genes appeared to be expressed at elevated levels in male antennae. Twenty-nine genes were expressed at significantly elevated levels in female antennae. In total, 11 OR genes were selected for further sequence analysis. The selected proteins were structurally characterized, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Overall, in this study, candidate ORs of S. zeamais have been identified for the first time, and these ORs could be molecular targets for interference in the insect olfactory system. "
negative,"Dosage analysis of Z chromosome genes using microarray in silkworm, Bombyx mori. In many organisms, dosage compensation is needed to equalize sex-chromosome gene expression in males and females. Several genes on silkworm Z chromosome were previously detected to show a higher expression level in males and lacked dosage compensation. Whether silkworm lacks global dosage compensation still remains poorly known. Here, we analyzed male:female (M:F) ratios of expression of chromosome-wide Z-linked genes in the silkworm using microarray data. The expression levels of genes on Z chromosome in each tissue were significantly higher in males compared to females, which indicates no global dosage compensation in silkworm. Interestingly, we also found some genes with no bias (M:F ratio: 0.8-1.2) on the Z chromosome. Comparison of male-biased (M:F ratio more than 1.5) and unbiased genes indicated that the two sets of the genes have functional differences. Analysis of gene expression by sex showed that M:F ratios were, to some extent, associated with their expression levels. These results provide useful clues to further understanding roles of dosage of Z chromosome and some Z-linked sexual differences in silkworms. "
negative,"Chemosensory proteins in the honey bee: Insights from the annotated genome, comparative analyses and expressional profiling. Small chemosensory proteins (CSPs) belong to a conserved, but poorly understood protein family that has been implicated in transporting chemical stimuli within insect sensilla. However, their expression patterns suggest that these molecules are also critical for other functions including early development. Here we used both bioinformatics and experimental approaches to characterize the CSP gene family in a social insect, the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, and then compared its members to CSPs in other arthropods. The number of CSPs in the honey bee genome (six) is similar to that found in the sequenced dipteran species (four-seven), but is much lower than the number of CSPs in the moth or in the beetle (around 20 each). These differences seem to be the result of lineage specific expansions. Our analysis of CSPs in a number of arthropods reveals a conserved gene family found in both Mandibulates and Chelicerates. Expressional profiling in diverse tissues and throughout development reveals broader than expected patterns of expression with none of the CSPs restricted to the antennae and one found only in the queen ovaries and in embryos. We conclude that CSPs are multifunctional context-dependent proteins involved in diverse cellular processes ranging from embryonic development to chemosensory signal transduction. Some CSPs may function in cuticle synthesis, consistent with their evolutionary origins in the arthropods. "
positive,"Functional analysis of saxophone, the Drosophila gene encoding the BMP type I receptor ortholog of human ALK1 / ACVRL1 and ACVR1 / ALK2. In metazoans, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) direct a myriad of developmental and adult homeostatic events through their heterotetrameric type I and type II receptor complexes. We examined 3 existing and 12 newly generated mutations in the Drosophila type I receptor gene, saxophone (sax), the ortholog of the human Activin Receptor-Like Kinase1 and -2 (ALK1 / ACVRL1 and ALK2 / ACVR1) genes. Our genetic analyses identified two distinct classes of sax alleles. The first class consists of homozygous viable gain-of-function (GOF) alleles that exhibit (1) synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in BMP pathway components, and (2) significant maternal effect lethality that can be rescued by an increased dosage of the BMP encoding gene, dpp+. In contrast, the second class consists of alleles that are recessive lethal and do not exhibit lethality in combination with mutations in other BMP pathway components. The alleles in this second class are clearly loss-of-function (LOF) with both complete and partial loss-of-function mutations represented. We find that one allele in the second class of recessive lethals exhibits dominant-negative behavior, albeit distinct from the GOF activity of the first class of viable alleles. On the basis of the fact that the first class of viable alleles can be reverted to lethality and on our ability to independently generate recessive lethal sax mutations, our analysis demonstrates that sax is an essential gene. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that a normal sax transcript is produced by saxP, a viable allele previously reported to be null, and that this allele can be reverted to lethality. Interestingly, we determine that two mutations in the first class of sax alleles show the same amino acid substitutions as mutations in the human receptors ALK1 / ACVRl-1 and ACVR1 / ALK2, responsible for cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), respectively. Finally, the data presented here identify different functional requirements for the Sax receptor, support the proposal that Sax participates in a heteromeric receptor complex, and provide a mechanistic framework for future investigations into disease states that arise from defects in BMP / TGF-beta signaling. "
negative,"The complete mitogenome sequences of the palaeopteran insects Ephemera orientalis (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae) and Davidius lunatus (Odonata: Gomphidae). Currently, the palaeopteran lineages (insect orders Ephemeroptera and Odonata) that have a problematic relationship with neopteran lineages are poorly represented by mitogenome sequences. In this study, we have determined the complete mitogenome of the oriental mayfly, Ephemera orientalis (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae), and the dragonfly Davidius lunatus (Odonata: Gomphidae). The 16 463 bp mitogenome of E. orientalis and the 15 912 bp mitogenome of D. lunatus have many of the features typically detected in insect mitogenomes. Although the initiation codon for the D. lunatus COI gene is the typical ATA, E. orientalis is unusual in that no typical start codon was detected in the start region of the COI gene. The A+T-rich regions of both mitogenomes have some unusual features. The E. orientalis A+T-rich region harbors two identical 55 bp sequences separated by 158 bp, and the D. lunatus A+T-rich region harbors a tandem repeat comprising two identical 261 bp copies and one partial copy of the repeat. Additionally, the A+T-rich regions of both mitogenomes harbor the stem-and-loop structures flanked by the conserved sequences ""TA(A)TA"" at the 5' end and ""G(A)nT"" at the 3' end, which have been suggested to be the signals involved in minor strand replication initiation. Furthermore, the D. lunatus A+T-rich region contains two tRNA-like structures with proper anticodon and cloverleaf structures. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex: Tettigoniidae: Orthoptera) and an analysis of control region variability. The Anabrus simplex is a swarming plague orthopteran found in western North America. The genome is 15 766 bp in length and genome organization follows the ancestral insect gene arrangement. atp6 lacked any readily identifiable stop codon. Examination of mRNA secondary structure for this gene suggested a stem / loop-mediated mRNA post-transcriptional processing to liberate a mature atp6 mRNA with a complete stop codon produced by polyadenylation. Comparison of similar protein with protein gene boundaries in other insect species reveal a general mechanism for mRNA excision and provide further supporting evidence for post-transcriptional mRNA processing in mitochondrial genomes. The A + T-rich region, or control region, was sequenced for 55 A. simplex individuals from 12 different populations. Variance studies between these individuals show that the A + T-rich region contains significant phylogenetic signal to be used in population studies. "
positive,"MiR-219 represses expression of dFMR1 in Drosophila melanogaster. AIMS: Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a vital role in mRNA trafficking and translation inhibition to regulate the synthesis of local proteins in neuronal axons and dendritic terminals. However, there are no reports on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of FMRP levels in Drosophila. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs regulating FMRP levels in Drosophila. MAIN METHODS: Using online software, we predicted and selected 11 miRNAs potentially acting on the Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dFMR1) transcript. These candidates were screened for modulation of dFMR1 transcript levels at the cellular level using a dual luciferase reporter system. In addition, we constructed a transgenic Drosophila model overexpressing miR-219 in the nervous system and quantified dFMRP by western blotting. The neuromuscular junction phenotype in the model was studied by immunofluorescence staining. KEY FINDINGS: Among the 11 miRNAs screened, miR-219 and miR-960 reduced luciferase gene activity by binding to the 3'-UTR of the dFMR1 transcript. Mutation of the miR-219 or miR-960 binding sites on the transcript resulted in complete or partial elimination of the miRNA-induced repression. Western blots revealed that dFMRP expression was decreased in the miR-219 overexpression model (Elav>miR-219). Drosophila larvae overexpressing miR-219 showed morphological abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (increased synaptic boutons and synaptic branches). This finding is consistent with some phenotypes observed in dfmr1 mutants. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that miR-219 regulates dFMR1 expression in Drosophila and is involved in fragile X syndrome pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings expand the current understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of target molecule-related functions. "
negative,"The molecular basis of social behavior: models, methods and advances. Elucidating the molecular and neural basis of complex social behaviors such as communal living, division of labor and warfare requires model organisms that exhibit these multi-faceted behavioral phenotypes. Social insects, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, are attractive models to address this problem, with rich ecological and ethological foundations. However, their atypical systems of reproduction have hindered application of classical genetic approaches. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in social insect genomics, transcriptomics, and functional manipulations have enhanced our ability to observe and perturb gene expression, physiology and behavior in these species. Such developments begin to provide an integrated view of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of complex social behavior. "
negative,"Interaction of plant defense compounds with the insect gut: new insights from genomic and molecular analyses. The co-evolutionary conflict between insect herbivores and their host plants is profoundly influenced by biochemical reactions associated with passage of toxin-laden plant material through the herbivore digestive canal. Insect herbivores provide excellent models in which to understand the mechanistic interplay between nutrition and detoxification, how plant defense compounds hijack these processes, and how insects adapt to host defense chemistry. Expanding genome sequence information and genetic approaches to manipulate gene function in both interacting partners are providing new insights into the genetic underpinnings of host preference and plasticity in gut physiology. Fundamental knowledge gained from these studies has practical application in understanding how insects evolve resistance to pesticides, and may also inform efforts to better understand how plant chemicals impact human health.

negative,"Complete mitochondrial genome of the stonefly Cryptoperla stilifera Sivec (Plecoptera: Peltoperlidae) and the phylogeny of Polyneopteran insects. We present the complete mitogenome of a stonefly, Cryptoperla stilifera Sivec (Plecoptera; Peltoperlidae). The mitogenome was a circular molecule consisting of 15,633 nucleotides, 37 genes and a A+T-rich region. C. stilifera mitogenome was similar to Pteronarcys princeps mitogenome (Plecoptera; Pteronarcyidae). All transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) had typical cloverleaf secondary structures except for trnSer (AGN), where the stem-loop structure of the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm was missing. The A+T-rich region of C. stilifera had two stem-loops and each had two interlink. Three conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) were present in the A+T-rich regions of C. stilifera, Peltoperla tarteri and Peltoperla arcuata. Moreover, many polynucleotide stretches (Poly N, N=A, T and C) in the A+T-rich region of C. stilifera Phylogenetic relationships of Polyneopteran species were constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs). Both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses supported Grylloblattodea as the sister group to Plecoptera+Dermaptera and Embiidina and Phasmatodea as sister groups. "
negative,"Enhanced production of spinosad in Saccharopolyspora spinosa by genome shuffling. Spinosad (spinosyns A and D) is a mixture of secondary metabolites produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is used in agriculture as a potent insect control agent with exceptional safety to non-target organisms. In this study, we applied genome shuffling of S. spinosa to achieve a rapid improvement of spinosad production. Ten strains with subtle improvements in spinosad production were obtained from the populations generated by the mutation with nitrosoguanidine and ultraviolet irradiation, and then they were subjected for recursive protoplast fusion. After four rounds of genome shuffling, a high yielding strain, designated as S. spinosa 4-7, was successfully isolated. Its production reached 547 mg / L, which was increased by 200.55% and 436.27% in comparison with that of the highest parent strain and the original strain, respectively. The subculture experiments indicated that the high producer of S. spinosa 4-7 was stable. Spinosad fermentation experiments by S. spinosa 4-7 were carried out in a 5-L fermentor, and its production of spinosad reached 428 mg / L after 168 h of fermentation. "
negative,"Bombyx small RNAs: genomic defense system against transposons in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Selfish genetic elements called transposons can insert themselves at new locations in host genomes to modify gene structure and alter gene expression. Expansion of transposons can occur when novel transposition events are transmitted to subsequent generations after germline hopping. Therefore, organisms seem likely to have evolved defense mechanisms to silence transposons in the germline. Recently, small RNAs interacting with Piwi proteins (piwi-interacting RNAs: piRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in genomic defense mechanism against transposons. Here, we show that piRNA-like small RNAs are present abundantly in the Bombyx ovary. We cloned 38,493 kinds of Bombyx small RNA from the ovary and performed functional characterization. Bombyx small RNAs showed a unimodal length distribution with a peak at 28nt and a strong bias for U at the 5' end. We found that 12,869 kinds of Bombyx small RNAs were associated with transposons or repetitive sequences. We classified them as repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs), a subclass of piRNAs. Notably, antisense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward U at 5' ends; in contrast, sense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward A at nucleotide position 10, indicating that the piRNA amplification loop proposed in Drosophila is evolutionarily conserved in Bombyx. These results suggest that Bombyx small RNAs regulate transposon activity. "
negative,"The pea aphid genome sequence brings theories of insect defense into question. The genome sequence of the pea aphid is the first for a basal hemimetabolous insect and provides insights into developmental plasticity, symbiosis and insect immunity. "
negative,"Genetic diversity of Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi related to biting behavior in western Amazon. BACKGROUND: In the Amazon Basin, Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi is the most aggressive and effective malaria vector. In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution. METHODS: To investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (~ 20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (~ 8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn). RESULTS: Genome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and FST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genomes of soft ticks have an arrangement of genes that has remained unchanged for over 400 million years. There are two major groups of ticks: soft ticks and hard ticks. The hard ticks comprise the prostriate ticks and the metastriate ticks. The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of one species of prostriate tick and two species of metastriate ticks had been sequenced prior to our study. The prostriate tick has the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the two metastriate ticks have rearrangements of eight genes and duplicate control regions. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of soft ticks had not been studied. We sequenced the mt genomes of two species of soft ticks, Carios capensis and Ornithodoros moubata, and a metastriate tick, Haemaphysalis flava. We found that the soft ticks have the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the metastriate tick, H. flava, shares the rearrangements of mt genes and duplicate control regions with the other two metastriate ticks that have previously been studied. Our study indicates that gene rearrangements and duplicate control regions in mt genomes occurred once in the most recent common ancestor of metastriate ticks, whereas the ancestral arrangement of arthropods has remained unchanged for over 400 million years in the lineages leading to the soft ticks and the prostriate ticks. "
negative,"Multiple coding sequences for the genome-linked virus protein (VPg) in dicistroviruses. N-terminal Edman sequencing of the genome-linked viral protein (VPg) of Plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV, Dicistroviridae) detected heterologus residues. The VPg sequence determined was found to be triplicated in the nonstructural protein precursor. Multiple VPg-like sequences were also found in 10 of the 12 dicistroviruses with a maximum of six copies in Solenopsis invicta virus-1. We postulate that redundant VPg coding sequences facilitate multiplication of dicistroviruses, because fewer cycle of translation of the nonstructural protein precursor produces larger amounts of VPg proteins in parallel with the increased production of capsid proteins by the intergenic internal ribosome entry site mediated translation. "
negative,"Mosquito-borne Inkoo virus in northern Sweden - isolation and whole genome sequencing. BACKGROUND: Inkoo virus (INKV) is a less known mosquito-borne virus belonging to Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus, California serogroup. Studies indicate that INKV infection is mainly asymptomatic, but can cause mild encephalitis in humans. In northern Europe, the sero-prevalence against INKV is high, 41% in Sweden and 51% in Finland. Previously, INKV RNA has been detected in adult Aedes (Ae.) communis, Ae. hexodontus and Ae. punctor mosquitoes and Ae. communis larvae, but there are still gaps of knowledge regarding mosquito vectors and genetic diversity. Therefore, we aimed to determine the occurrence of INKV in its mosquito vector and characterize the isolates. METHODS: About 125,000 mosquitoes were collected during a mosquito-borne virus surveillance in northern Sweden during the summer period of 2015. Of these, 10,000 mosquitoes were processed for virus isolation and detection using cell culture and RT-PCR. Virus isolates were further characterized by whole genome sequencing. Genetic typing of mosquito species was conducted by cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene amplification and sequencing (genetic barcoding). RESULTS: Several Ae. communis mosquitoes were found positive for INKV RNA and two isolates were obtained. The first complete sequences of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments of INKV in Sweden were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the INKV genome was most closely related to other INKV isolates from Sweden and Finland. Of the three INKV genome segments, the INKV M segment had the highest frequency of non-synonymous mutations. The overall G / C-content of INKV genes was low for the N / NSs genes (43.8-45.5%), polyprotein (Gn / Gc / NSm) gene (35.6%) and the RNA polymerase gene (33.8%) This may be due to the fact that INKV in most instances utilized A or T in the third codon position. CONCLUSIONS: INKV is frequently circulating in northern Sweden and Ae. communis is the key vector. The high mutation rate of the INKV M segment may have consequences on virulence. "
negative,"Ecological genomics of Boechera stricta: identification of a QTL controlling the allocation of methionine- vs branched-chain amino acid-derived glucosinolates and levels of insect herbivory. In the Brassicaceae, glucosinolates influence the feeding, reproduction and development of many insect herbivores. Glucosinolate production and effects on herbivore feeding have been extensively studied in the model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica crops, both of which constitutively produce leaf glucosinolates mostly derived from the amino acid, methionine. Much less is known about the regulation or role in defense of glucosinolates derived from other aliphatic amino acids, such as the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), valine and isoleucine. We have identified a glucosinolate polymorphism in Boechera stricta controlling the allocation to BCAA- vs methionine-derived glucosinolates in both leaves and seeds. B. stricta is a perennial species that grows in mostly undisturbed habitats of western North America. We have measured glucosinolate profiles and concentrations in 192 F(2) lines that have earlier been used for genetic map construction. We also performed herbivory assays on six F(3) replicates per F(2) line using the generalist lepidopteran, Trichoplusia ni. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a single locus controlling both glucosinolate profile and levels of herbivory, the branched chain-methionine allocation or BCMA QTL. We have delimited this QTL to a small genomic region with a 1.0 LOD confidence interval just 1.9 cm wide, which, in A. thaliana, contains approximately 100 genes. We also found that methionine-derived glucosinolates provided significantly greater defense than the BCAA-derived glucosinolates against feeding by this generalist insect herbivore. The future positional cloning of this locus will allow for testing various adaptive explanations. "
negative,"The life cycle of a genome project: perspectives and guidelines inspired by insect genome projects. Many research programs on non-model species biology have been empowered by genomics. In turn, genomics is underpinned by a reference sequence and ancillary information created by so-called ""genome projects"". The most reliable genome projects are the ones created as part of an active research program and designed to address specific questions but their life extends past publication. In this opinion paper I outline four key insights that have facilitated maintaining genomic communities: the key role of computational capability, the iterative process of building genomic resources, the value of community participation and the importance of manual curation. Taken together, these ideas can and do ensure the longevity of genome projects and the growing non-model species community can use them to focus a discussion with regards to its future genomic infrastructure.  "
negative,"Caterpillars evolved from onychophorans by hybridogenesis. I reject the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor. Rather I posit that, in animals that metamorphose, the basic types of larvae originated as adults of different lineages, i.e., larvae were transferred when, through hybridization, their genomes were acquired by distantly related animals. ""Caterpillars,"" the name for eruciforms with thoracic and abdominal legs, are larvae of lepidopterans, hymenopterans, and mecopterans (scorpionflies). Grubs and maggots, including the larvae of beetles, bees, and flies, evolved from caterpillars by loss of legs. Caterpillar larval organs are dismantled and reconstructed in the pupal phase. Such indirect developmental patterns (metamorphoses) did not originate solely by accumulation of random mutations followed by natural selection; rather they are fully consistent with my concept of evolution by hybridogenesis. Members of the phylum Onychophora (velvet worms) are proposed as the evolutionary source of caterpillars and their grub or maggot descendants. I present a molecular biological research proposal to test my thesis. By my hypothesis 2 recognizable sets of genes are detectable in the genomes of all insects with caterpillar grub- or maggot-like larvae: (i) onychophoran genes that code for proteins determining larval morphology / physiology and (ii) sequentially expressed insect genes that code for adult proteins. The genomes of insects and other animals that, by contrast, entirely lack larvae comprise recognizable sets of genes from single animal common ancestors. "
negative,"Comprehensive identification of Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning genes using a whole-genome tiling array. Dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo is initiated by Dorsal, a sequence-specific transcription factor distributed in a broad nuclear gradient in the precellular embryo. Previous studies have identified as many as 70 protein-coding genes and one microRNA (miRNA) gene that are directly or indirectly regulated by this gradient. A gene regulation network, or circuit diagram, including the functional interconnections among 40 Dorsal target genes and 20 associated tissue-specific enhancers, has been determined for the initial stages of gastrulation. Here, we attempt to extend this analysis by identifying additional DV patterning genes using a recently developed whole-genome tiling array. This analysis led to the identification of another 30 protein-coding genes, including the Drosophila homolog of Idax, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. In addition, remote 5' exons were identified for at least 10 of the approximately 100 protein-coding genes that were missed in earlier annotations. As many as nine intergenic uncharacterized transcription units were identified, including two that contain known microRNAs, miR-1 and -9a. We discuss the potential functions of these recently identified genes and suggest that intronic enhancers are a common feature of the DV gene network. "
negative,"Agricultural applications of insect ecological genomics. Agricultural entomology is poised to benefit from the application of ecological genomics, particularly the fields of biofuels generation and pest control. Metagenomic methods can characterize microbial communities of termites, wood-boring beetles and livestock pests, and transcriptomic approaches reveal molecular bases behind wood-digesting capabilities of these insects, leading to potential mechanisms for biofuel generation. Genome sequences are being exploited to develop new pest control methods, identify candidate antigens to vaccinate livestock, and discover RNAi target sequences and potential non-target effects in other insects. Gene content analyses of pest genome sequences and their endosymbionts suggest metabolic interdependencies between organisms, exposing potential gene targets for insect control. Finally, genome-wide association studies and genotyping by high-throughput sequencing promise to improve management of pesticide resistance. "
negative,"Assessing gene expression during pathogenesis: Use of qRT-PCR to follow toxin production in the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana during infection and immune response of the insect host Triatoma infestans. Entomopathogenic fungi secrete toxic secondary metabolites during the invasion of the insect hemocoel as part of the infection process. Although these compounds have been frequently mentioned as virulence factors, the roles of many of them remain poorly understood, including the question of whether they are expressed during the infection process. A major hurdle to this issue remains the low sensitivity of biochemical detection techniques (e.g., HPLC) within the complex samples that may contain trace quantities of fungal molecules inside the insect. In this study, quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the transcript levels within the insect fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana, that encode for the synthetase enzymes of the secondary metabolites tenellin (BbtenS), beauvericin (BbbeaS) and bassianolide (BbbslS) during the infection of Triatoma infestans, a Chagas disease insect vector. Absolute quantification was performed at different time periods after insect treatment with various concentrations of propagules, either by immersing the insects in conidial suspensions or by injecting them with blastospores. Both BbtenS and BbbeaS were highly expressed in conidia-treated insects at days 3 and 12 post-treatment. In blastospore-injected insects, BbtenS and BbbeaS expression peaked at 24h post-injection and were also highly expressed in insect cadavers. The levels of BbbslS transcripts were much lower in all conditions tested. The expression patterns of insect genes encoding proteins that belong to the T. infestans humoral immune system were also evaluated with the same technique. This qPCR-based methodology can contribute to decifering the dynamics of entomopathogenic fungal infection at the molecular level.  "
negative,"Expression- and genomic-level changes during passage of four baculoviruses derived from bacmids in permissive insect cell lines. The baculovirus-based bacmid expression vector system has been widely used for protein production in basic research and biotechnological laboratories. Since the first construction of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid (AcBacmid), three more bacmids have been created from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmBacmid), Spodoptera exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeBacmid) and Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaBacmid). Each of these bacmid-derived viruses replicates efficiently in a range of specific and permissive cell types. Here, we investigated the relative stability of each virus derived from the bacmid during passage in permissive cell lines through assessment of their expression level and genome structure changes. Using two different reporters, the expression levels of the viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf9, AcBacmid-Tn5, BmBacmid-BmN and SeBacmid-SeE1 bacmid-cell systems were significantly reduced after five passages of the viruses, whereas the reductions were not detected in the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 systems. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of viral DNA isolated from passaged viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 systems showed no major genomic changes. In contrast, the genomes from passaged viruses in the AcBacmid-Tn5 and AcBacmid-Sf9 systems displayed reduced genome size and various mutations at individual loci, including genotypes missing one at least or more viral RNA polymerase subunits and fp25k. These genotypic changes were correlated with reduced protein expression. RFLP analysis of viral DNA from passaged viruses in the BmBacmid-BmN and SeBacmid-SeE1 systems exhibited changes in genome size, including excision of particular EcoRI fragments containing the mini-F replicon. Collectively, our data suggest that the viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 bacmid-cell systems are better for large-scale protein expression in continuous culture. Further study is needed to investigate the mechanism(s) behind the protein expression reduction in these bacmid-derived virus / cell systems. "
negative,"Microarray analysis of kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) bark following challenge by the sucking insect Hemiberlesia lataniae (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Both commercial and experimental genotypes of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) exhibit large differences in response to insect pests. An understanding of the vine's physiological response to insect feeding and its genetic basis will be important in assisting the development of varieties with acceptable levels of pest resistance. This experiment describes transcriptome changes observed in the bark of kiwifruit 2 and 7 days after the commencement of feeding by the armored scale insect pest, Hemiberlesia lataniae. Using a cDNA microarray consisting of 17,512 unigenes, we measured transcriptome changes and analyzed these into functional ontology categories using MapMan. Results are available in the GEO database GSE73922 and are described fully in Ref. Hill et al. (2015) [1]. After 7 days, transcripts associated with photosynthesis were down-regulated and secondary metabolism was up-regulated. Differential expression of transcripts associated with stress response was consistent with a defense response involving both effector and herbivore-triggered immunities, with predominant involvement of the salicylic acid phytohormonal pathway. This hypothesis was supported by the results of two laboratory experiments. The methods described here could be further adapted and applied to the study of plant responses to a wide range of sessile sucking pests.  "
negative,"Gene expression profiling of tolerant barley in response to Diuraphis noxia (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding. Aphids are, arguably, the single most damaging group of agricultural insect pests throughout the world. Plant tolerance, which is a plant response to an insect pest, is viewed as an excellent management strategy. Developing testable hypotheses based on genome-wide and more focused methods will help in understanding the molecular underpinnings of plant tolerance to aphid herbivory. As a first step in this process, we undertook transcript profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip Barley Genome arrays using RNA extracted from tissues of tolerant and susceptible genotypes collected at three hours, three days and six days after Diuraphis noxia introduction. Acquired data were compared to identify changes unique to the tolerant barley at each harvest date. Transcript abundance of 4086 genes was differentially changed over the three harvest dates in tolerant and susceptible barley in response to D. noxia feeding. Across the three harvest dates, the greatest number of genes was differentially expressed in both barleys at three days after aphid introduction. A total of 909 genes showed significant levels of change in the tolerant barley in response to D. noxia feeding as compared to susceptible plants infested with aphids. Many of these genes could be assigned to specific metabolic categories, including several associated with plant defense and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, two peroxidase genes, designated HvPRXA1 and HvPRXA2, were up-regulated to a greater degree in response to D. noxia feeding on tolerant barley plants, indicating that specific peroxidases could be important for the tolerance process. These findings suggest that the ability to elevate and sustain levels of ROS-scavenging enzymes could play an important role in the tolerant response. "
positive,"Sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on molting hormone levels and mRNA expressions of three Halloween genes in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. While sublethal effects of insecticide on insect development have been widely studied, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Our previous studies revealed that sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole significantly increased the juvenile hormone levels and resulted in both prolonged developmental time and reduced fecundity in Chilo suppressalis. In the present study, we evaluated the sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on molting hormone (MH) levels and mRNA expressions of three Halloween genes including CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 in C. suppressalis. The results showed that the MH levels in different developmental stages of C. suppressalis were decreased after exposure to LC10 and LC30 of chlorantraniliprole. However, analysis of temporal expression profiles revealed that the mRNA levels of three Halloween genes were not closely correlated with the ecdysteroid titers in C. suppressalis. Notably, the transcript levels of CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 were induced after treatment with sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in specific developmental stages. These results indicated that chlorantraniliprole had adverse effects on insect MH biosynthesis, and in addition to the involvement in MH biosynthesis, CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 may also play important roles in the detoxification metabolism of chlorantraniliprole in C. suppressalis. "
positive,"A gut-specific chitinase gene essential for regulation of chitin content of peritrophic matrix and growth of Ostrinia nubilalis larvae. Chitinases belong to a large and diverse family of hydrolytic enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds of chitin. However, very little is known about the function of chitinase genes in regulating the chitin content in peritrophic matrix (PM) of the midgut in insects. We identified a cDNA putatively encoding a chitinase (OnCht) in European corn borer (ECB; Ostrinia nubilalis). The OnCht transcript was predominately found in larval midgut but undetectable in eggs, pupae, or adults. When the larvae were fed on an artificial diet, the OnCht transcript level increased by 4.4-fold but the transcript level of a gut-specific chitin synthase (OnCHS2) gene decreased by 2.5-fold as compared with those of unfed larvae. In contrast, when the larvae were fed with the food and then starved for 24h, the OnCht transcript level decreased by 1.8-fold but the transcript level of OnCHS2 increased by 1.8-fold. Furthermore, there was a negative relationship between OnCht transcript level and chitin content in the midgut. By using a feeding-based RNAi technique, we were able to reduce the OnCht transcript level by 63-64% in the larval midgut. Consequently, these larvae showed significantly increased chitin content (26%) in the PM but decreased larval body weight (54%) as compared with the control larvae fed on the diet containing GFP dsRNA. Therefore, for the first time, we provide strong evidence that OnCht plays an important role in regulating chitin content of the PM and subsequently affecting the growth and development of the ECB larvae. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome characterization of Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and its phylogenetic relationship with other lepidopteran insects. The complete mitogenome of the potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) was sequenced, annotated, characterized and compared with 140 species of the order Lepidoptera. The circular genome is 15,251 bp, containing 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and an A+T-rich region). The gene arrangement was identical to other lepidopteran mitogenomes but different from the ancestral arrangement found in most insects for the tRNA-Met gene (A+T-region, tRNA-I, tRNA-Q, tRNA-M). The mitogenome of T. solanivora is highly A+T-biased (78.2%) and exhibits negative AT- and GC-skews. All PCGs are initiated by canonical ATN start codons, except for Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 (COI), which is initiated by CGA. Most PCGs have a complete typical stop codon (TAA). Only NAD1 has a TAG stop codon and the COII and NAD5 genes have an incomplete stop codon consisting of just a T. The A+T-rich region is 332 bp long and contains common features found in lepidopteran mitogenomes, including the 'ATAGA' motif, a 17 bp poly (T) stretch and a (AT)8 element preceded by the 'ATTTA' motif. Other tandem repeats like (TAA)4 and (TAT)7 were found, as well as (T)6 and (A)10 mononucleotide repeat elements. Finally, this mitogenome has 20 intergenic spacer regions. The phylogenetic relationship of T. solanivora with 28 other lepidopteran families (12 superfamilies) showed that taxonomic classification by morphological features coincides with the inferred phylogeny. Thus, the Gelechiidae family represents a monophyletic group, suggesting that T. solanivora and Pectinophora gossypiella have a recent common ancestor. "
negative,"Identification of the Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) peritrophic matrix proteins and enzymes involved in peritrophic matrix chitin metabolism. The peritrophic matrix (PM) is essential for insect digestive system physiology as it protects the midgut epithelium from damage by food particles, pathogens, and toxins. The PM is also an attractive target for development of new pest control strategies due to its per os accessibility. To understand how the PM performs these functions, the molecular architecture of the PM was examined using genomic and proteomic approaches in Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major pest of cruciferous oilseed crops in North America. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the PM identified 82 proteins classified as: (i) peritrophins, including a new class with a CBDIII domain; (ii) enzymes involved in chitin modification (chitin deacetylases), digestion (serine proteases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, lipases and α-amylase) or other reactions (β-1,3-glucanase, alkaline phosphatase, dsRNase, astacin, pantetheinase); (iii) a heterogenous group consisting of polycalin, REPATs, serpin, C-Type lectin and Lsti99 / Lsti201 and 3 novel proteins without known orthologs. The genes encoding PM proteins were expressed predominantly in the midgut. cDNAs encoding chitin synthase-2 (McCHS-2), chitinase (McCHI), and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (McNAG) enzymes, involved in PM chitin metabolism, were also identified. McCHS-2 expression was specific to the midgut indicating that it is responsible for chitin synthesis in the PM, the only chitinous material in the midgut. In contrast, the genes encoding the chitinolytic enzymes were expressed in multiple tissues. McCHS-2, McCHI, and McNAG were expressed in the midgut of feeding larvae, and NAG activity was present in the PM. This information was used to generate an updated model of the lepidopteran PM architecture.  "
negative,"A de novo transcriptome of European pollen beetle populations and its analysis, with special reference to insecticide action and resistance. The pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus is the most important coleopteran pest in European oilseed rape cultivation, annually infesting millions of hectares and responsible for substantial yield losses if not kept under economic damage thresholds. This species is primarily controlled with insecticides but has recently developed high levels of resistance to the pyrethroid class. The aim of the present study was to provide a transcriptomic resource to investigate mechanisms of resistance. cDNA was sequenced on both Roche (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Illumina (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) platforms, resulting in a total of ∼53 m reads which assembled into 43 396 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Manual annotation revealed good coverage of genes encoding insecticide target sites and detoxification enzymes. A total of 77 nonredundant cytochrome P450 genes were identified. Mapping of Illumina RNAseq sequences (from susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains) against the reference transcriptome identified a cytochrome P450 (CYP6BQ23) as highly overexpressed in pyrethroid resistance strains. Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis confirmed the presence of a target-site resistance mutation (L1014F) in the voltage-gated sodium channel of one resistant strain. Our results provide new insights into the important genes associated with pyrethroid resistance in M. aeneus. Furthermore, a comprehensive EST resource is provided for future studies on insecticide modes of action and resistance mechanisms in pollen beetle.  "
positive,"Study of the aminopeptidase N gene family in the lepidopterans Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) and Bombyx mori (L.): sequences, mapping and expression. Aminopeptidases N (APNs) are a class of ectoenzymes present in lepidopteran larvae midguts, involved in the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins mode of action. In the present work, seven aminopeptidases have been cloned from the midgut of Ostrinia nubilalis, the major Lepidopteran corn pest in the temperate climates. Six sequences were identified as APNs because of the presence of the HEXXH(X)18E and GAMEN motifs, as well as the signal peptide and the GPI-anchor sequences. The remaining sequence did not contain the two cellular targeting signals, indicating it belonged to the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) family. An in silico analysis allowed us to find orthologous sequences in Bombyx mori. A phylogenetic study of lepidopteran aminopeptidase sequences resulted in their clustering into nine classes. Linkage analysis revealed that the onapn genes as well as all bmapn genes clustered in a single linkage group. O. nubilalis aminopeptidases were expressed in all larval instars. In 5th instar larvae tissues, apns transcripts were found mainly in midguts while apn8 was also highly expressed in Malpighian tubules, and psa showed an ubiquitous expression pattern in O. nubilalis and B. mori. The sequence homology and gene organization of apns suggest a single origin from an ancestral lepidopteran apn gene. "
positive,"Expression Patterns, Molecular Characterization, and Response to Host Stress of CYP Genes from Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). The quarantine insect pest Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) has a broad host range and is distributed worldwide. Each year, P. solenopsis causes significant crop losses. The detoxification of various xenobiotic compounds involves the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) superfamily of enzymes. However, the functions of CYPs in P. solenopsis are poorly understood. In the present study, P. solenopsis was reared from the egg to the adult stage on three host plants: Tomato, cotton, and hibiscus. Thirty-seven P. solenopsis CYP genes were identified and their phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. Eleven CYP genes (PsCYP4NT1, PsCYP4G219, PsCYP6PZ1, PsCYP6PZ5, PsCYP301B1, PsCYP302A1, PsCYP305A22, PsCYP315A1, PsCYP353F1, PsCYP3634A1, and PsCYP3635A2) were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The results demonstrated marked differences in CYP expression levels in P. solenopsis grown on different host plants. The results will aid the molecular characterization of CYPs and will increase our understanding of CYP expression patterns in P. solenopsis during development and growth on different hosts. "
positive,"RNA interference in Nilaparvata lugens (Homoptera: Delphacidae) based on dsRNA ingestion. BACKGROUND: An efficient and convenient RNA interference (RNAi) technique involving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion is useful for gene function studies of non-model insects. RESULTS: Three dsRNAs targeting different sites within a gene encoding vacuolar ATP synthase subunit E (V-ATPase-E, 21E01) were synthesised for RNAi in Nilaparvata lugens. dsRNA was found to be stable in 0.1 g mL(-1) sucrose solution, but unstable in artificial fodder. Therefore, dsRNAs were orally delivered into N. lugens in 0.1 g mL(-1) sucrose solution. RNAi was induced by all three of the dsRNAs at 0.05 µg µL(-1) in N. lugens. Time dynamics analysis of gene silencing indicated that significant suppression of the target gene began as early as 2 days after ingestion of ds2-21E01 and ds3-21E01. However, significant repressive effects were recorded up to 10 days after exposure to ds1-21E01. The maximum reduction in target gene mRNA was observed after 10 days of treatment, with suppression ratios induced by ds1-21E01, ds2-21E01 and ds3-21E01 of 41, 55 and 48% respectively. CONCLUSION: An efficient and convenient RNAi technique involving dsRNA ingestion has been successfully developed for N. lugens. This will be a useful tool for further functional genomic investigation in this organism. "
negative,"Complete Genome Sequence of a Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain Isolated from a Known Cotton Insect Boll Vector. Klebsiella pneumoniae (associated with bacterial pneumonia) was previously isolated from Nezara viridula, a significant vector of cotton boll-rot pathogens. We provide the first annotated genome sequence of the cotton opportunistic strain K. pneumoniae 5-1. This data provides guidance to study the bases of cotton pathogenesis by bacteria associated with vectors.  "
negative,"Gambol and Tc1 are two distinct families of DD34E transposons: analysis of the Anopheles gambiae genome expands the diversity of the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily. Tc1 is a family of DNA transposons found in diverse organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates and fungi. Tc1 belongs to the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily, which is characterized by common 'TA' target site and conserved D(Asp)DE(Glu) or DDD catalytic triad. All functional Tc1-like transposons contain a transposase with a DD34E catalytic triad. We conducted a systematic analysis of DD34E transposons in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, using a reiterative and exhaustive search program. In addition to previously described Tc1-like elements, we uncovered 26 new DD34E transposons including a novel family that we named gambol. Designation of family status to gambol is based on phylogenetic analyses of transposase sequences that showed gambol and Tc1 transposons as distinct clades that were separated by mariner and other families of the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily. The distinction between Tc1 and gambol is also consistent with the unique TIRs in gambol elements and the presence of a 'W[I / L / V]DEDC' signature near their N-termini. This signature is predicted as part of the 'RED' domain, a component of the 'PAI' and 'RED' DNA binding domains in Tc1 and possibly mariner. Although gambol appears to be related to a few DD34E transposons from cyanobacteria and fungi, no gambol has been reported in any other insects or animals thus far. Several gambol and Tc1 elements have intact ORFs and different genomic copies with high sequence identity, which suggests that they may have been recently active. "
negative,"Limited Genetic Structure of Gypsy Moth Populations Reflecting a Recent History in Europe. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, a prominent polyphagous species native to Eurasia, causes severe impacts in deciduous forests during irregular periodical outbreaks. This study aimed to describe the genetic structure and diversity among European gypsy moth populations. Analysis of about 500 individuals using a partial region of the mitochondrial COI gene, L. dispar was characterized by low genetic diversity, limited population structure, and strong evidence that all extant haplogroups arose via a single Holocene population expansion event. Overall 60 haplotypes connected to a single parsimony network were detected and genetic diversity was highest for the coastal populations Croatia, Italy, and France, while lowest in continental populations. Phylogenetic reconstruction resulted in three groups that were geographically located in Central Europe, Dinaric Alps, and the Balkan Peninsula. In addition to recent events, the genetic structure reflects strong gene flow and the ability of gypsy moth to feed on about 400 deciduous and conifer species. Distinct genetic groups were detected in populations from Georgia. This remote population exhibited haplotypes intermediate to the European L. dispar dispar, Asian L. dispar asiatica, and L. dispar japonica clusters, highlighting this area as a possible hybridization zone of this species for future studies applying genomic approaches. "
negative,"Characterization of genomic DNA encoding cecropins from an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line. We used cDNA probes from Aedes albopictus mosquito cecropins AalCecA, B, and C to obtain genomic DNA copies and flanking DNA. Two gene copies (AalCecA1 and A2, AalCecB1 and B2, AalCecC1 and C2) encoding each of the three mature cecropin peptides were recovered. All these genes had a similar organization, into two exons interrupted by a single short intron. AalCecA1 and AalCecA2 encode mature protein products that differ by one amino acid residue, while AalCecB1 and AalCecB2, AalCecC1 and AalCecC2 encode identical mature cecropin peptides, respectively. The AalCecB and C gene pairs each share a common intergenic region of approximately 1 kb, with the two coding regions transcribed in opposite directions. With the exception of small insertions / deletions, the intergenic spacer region was highly conserved between the B1 / C1 and B2 / C2 clones. In transfected cells, 0.8 kb of upstream sequence was sufficient for inducible expression of AalCecA1. Within this region, a 28 bp sequence at positions -192 to -165 upstream of the transcription initiation site was found to contain a potential regulatory element. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, synthetic double-stranded DNA containing this 28 bp sequence retarded protein in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from C7-10 cells. "
negative,"Social evolution. Genomic signatures of evolutionary transitions from solitary to group living. The evolution of eusociality is one of the major transitions in evolution, but the underlying genomic changes are unknown. We compared the genomes of 10 bee species that vary in social complexity, representing multiple independent transitions in social evolution, and report three major findings. First, many important genes show evidence of neutral evolution as a consequence of relaxed selection with increasing social complexity. Second, there is no single road map to eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and abundance of transposable elements. Eusociality may arise through different mechanisms each time, but would likely always involve an increase in the complexity of gene networks.  "
positive,"RNAi-Mediated Knockdown of Tssk1 and Tektin1 Genes Impair Male Fertility in Bactrocera dorsalis. The genetic-based sterile insect technique (SIT) is an effective and environmentally safe strategy to diminish populations of agricultural and horticultural insect pests. Functional characterization of genes related to male fertility can enhance the genetic-based SIT. Tssk1 has been involved to control male fertility in both mammals and insects. Moreover, Tektin1 has also been revealed to influence male fertility in both human and mammals. These findings suggested that Tssk1 and Tektin1 identified from Bactrocera dorsalis could be required for male fertility in B. dorsalis. In this study, expression profiles of these two genes were studied at different developmental stages and in various tissues of adult males. Remarkably, it was found that Tssk1 and Tektin1 were highly expressed in the testis of mature adult males of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, Tssk1 and Tektin1 genes were downregulated by using the RNA interference (RNAi) method. Fertility assays including egg laying, hatching, and spermatozoa count were also performed to investigate male fertility of B. dorsalis. Results showed that knockdown of Tssk1 and Tektin1 caused male sterility up to 58.99% and 64.49%, respectively. As expected, the total numbers of spermatozoa were also significantly reduced by 65.83% and 73.9%, respectively. These results suggested that male sterility was happened wing to the low number of spermatozoa. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Tssk1 and Tektin1 are the novel agents that could be used to enhance the genetic-based SIT, or their double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can be used as biopesticides to control the population of B. dorsalis. "
negative,"Estimation of long terminal repeat element content in the Helicoverpa zea genome from high-throughput sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome pools. The lepidopteran pest insect Helicoverpa zea feeds on cultivated corn and cotton across the Americas where control remains challenging owing to the evolution of resistance to chemical and transgenic insecticidal toxins, yet genomic resources remain scarce for this species. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library having a mean genomic insert size of 145 ± 20 kbp was created from a laboratory strain of H. zea, which provides ∼12.9-fold coverage of a 362.8 ± 8.8 Mbp (0.37 ± 0.09 pg) flow cytometry estimated haploid genome size. Assembly of Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads generated from 14 pools that encompassed all BAC clones resulted in 165 485 genomic contigs (N50 = 3262 bp; 324.6 Mbp total). Long terminal repeat (LTR) protein coding regions annotated from 181 contigs included 30 Ty1 / copia, 78 Ty3 / gypsy, and 73 BEL / Pao elements, of which 60 (33.1%) encoded all five functional polyprotein (pol) domains. Approximately 14% of LTR elements are distributed non-randomly across pools of BAC clones. "
negative,"Ant genomics sheds light on the molecular regulation of social organization. Ants are powerful model systems for the study of cooperation and sociality. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in ant genomics have contributed to our understanding of the evolution and organization of insect societies at the molecular level.  "
negative,"Two different farnesyl diphosphate synthase genes exist in the genome of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS; EC 2.5.1.1, 2.5.1.10) catalyzes biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate, which is important to insects as the precursor of juvenile hormone and the substrate for (E)-beta-farnesene synthase. Here, two FPS cDNAs were isolated from the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (EU334430 and EU334431). Their shared identity within the coding region is approximately 82%. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two M. persicae FPS cDNAs have the highly conserved motifs characteristic of most known FPSs. Phylogenetic analyses showed that they are closely related to other insect FPSs. Homology modeling of structures suggested a very good fit between the three-dimensional structures of the two putative M. persicae FPSs (designated as MpFPS1 and MpFPS2) and the avian FPS crystal structure. The corresponding genomic DNA sequences were subsequently determined (EU429295 and EU429296). Sequence comparisons revealed a different splicing pattern between the two MpFPS genes. Furthermore, the two MpFPS genes exhibited a seemingly very primitive gene-splicing pattern at 5' ends but a gene-splicing style similar to mammalian FPS genes at 3' ends. These data, combined with results of Southern blotting, suggest that M. persicae contains two different FPS genes. This is the first report that two different FPS genes exist in a hemipteran insect. "
negative,"Quinolizidine and Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Chemical Ecology - a Mini-Review on Their Similarities and Differences. This mini-review summarizes over 40 years of research on quinolizidine (QAs) and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Emphasis is on the chemical ecology of both groups of alkaloids, which serve as general defense compounds against herbivores for the plants producing them. For QAs and PAs, a number of insects (aphids, moths, beetles) have acquired tolerance. These specialists store the alkaloids and use them as defense chemicals against predators. In some PA sequestering moths, the adaptation is even more intricate and advanced. PAs can function as a morphogen to induce the formation of male coremata, inflatable organs that dissipate pheromones. In these insects, PAs are additionally used as a precursor for male pheromones. Female moths utilize their own PAs and those obtained from males via the spermatophore as nuptial gift, to transfer them to the eggs that thus become chemically protected. Novel genomic technologies will allow deeper insights in the molecular evolution of these two classes of alkaloids in plant-insect interactions. "
positive,"Life-span phenotypes of elav and Rbp9 in Drosophila suggest functional cooperation of the two ELAV-family protein genes. The ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins is involved in various aspects of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, from alternative splicing to translation. The members of this family have been shown to interact with each other and have been suggested to function as homo- and / or hetero-multimers. However, the functional interactions among them have not been demonstrated in vivo. In this study, we examined the genetic interaction between elav and Rbp9, two of the three genes encoding ELAV-family proteins in Drosophila. Mutants of both elav and Rbp9 showed shorter life spans than the control, with elav showing a shorter life span than Rbp9. The survival curve of elav-Rbp9 double-mutant flies was indistinguishable from that of elav single-mutant flies, suggesting that both mutations affect longevity through the same pathway. Considering the fact that both genes are co-expressed in adult neurons, we hypothesize that ELAV and Rbp9 cooperate to maintain the functional integrity of the adult nervous system. "
negative,"Attenuated virulence and genomic reductive evolution in the entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont species, Xenorhabdus poinarii. Bacteria of the genus Xenorhabdus are symbionts of soil entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Steinernema. This symbiotic association constitutes an insecticidal complex active against a wide range of insect pests. Unlike other Xenorhabdus species, Xenorhabdus poinarii is avirulent when injected into insects in the absence of its nematode host. We sequenced the genome of the X. poinarii strain G6 and the closely related but virulent X. doucetiae strain FRM16. G6 had a smaller genome (500-700 kb smaller) than virulent Xenorhabdus strains and lacked genes encoding potential virulence factors (hemolysins, type 5 secretion systems, enzymes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, and toxin-antitoxin systems). The genomes of all the X. poinarii strains analyzed here had a similar small size. We did not observe the accumulation of pseudogenes, insertion sequences or decrease in coding density usually seen as a sign of genomic erosion driven by genetic drift in host-adapted bacteria. Instead, genome reduction of X. poinarii seems to have been mediated by the excision of genomic blocks from the flexible genome, as reported for the genomes of attenuated free pathogenic bacteria and some facultative mutualistic bacteria growing exclusively within hosts. This evolutionary pathway probably reflects the adaptation of X. poinarii to specific host.  "
negative,"Raalin, a transcript enriched in the honey bee brain, is a remnant of genomic rearrangement in Hymenoptera. We identified a predicted compact cysteine-rich sequence in the honey bee genome that we called 'Raalin'. Raalin transcripts are enriched in the brain of adult honey bee workers and drones, with only minimum expression in other tissues or in pre-adult stages. Open-reading frame (ORF) homologues of Raalin were identified in the transcriptomes of fruit flies, mosquitoes and moths. The Raalin-like gene from Drosophila melanogaster encodes for a short secreted protein that is maximally expressed in the adult brain with negligible expression in other tissues or pre-imaginal stages. Raalin-like sequences have also been found in the recently sequenced genomes of six ant species, but not in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. As in the honey bee, the Raalin-like sequences of ants do not have an ORF. A comparison of the genome region containing Raalin in the genomes of bees, ants and the wasp provides evolutionary support for an extensive genome rearrangement in this sequence. Our analyses identify a new family of ancient cysteine-rich short sequences in insects in which insertions and genome rearrangements may have disrupted this locus in the branch leading to the Hymenoptera. The regulated expression of this transcript suggests that it has a brain-specific function. "
negative,"Site-specific, TALENs-mediated transformation of Bombyx mori. Transposon-based genetic transformation has facilitated insect functional genomics and new strategies of pest management. However, there is a need for alternative, site-specific approaches to overcome limitations of random integration (and associated position-effects) and potential instability of inserted transgenes. Here we describe a transposon-free, site-specific genetic transformation system mediated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a lepidopteran model insect. We successfully established a site-specific transgenic system with comparable transformation efficiency to transposon-based genetic transformation through microinjection of TALENs mRNA targeting the BmBLOS2 locus and a linearizable donor plasmid encoding an expression cassette of the DsRed2 red fluorescent protein. This system provides a valuable approach for insect transgenesis and will enable future functional gene analysis and generate novel applications in agricultural and medical insect pest-management technologies. "
negative,"A molecular concept of caste in insect societies. The term 'caste' is used to describe the division of reproductive labour that defines eusocial insect societies. The definition of 'caste' has been debated over the last 50 years, specifically with respect to the simplest insect societies; this raises the question of whether a simple categorisation of social behaviour by reproductive state alone is helpful. Gene-level analyses of behaviours of individuals in hymenopteran social insect societies now provide a new empirical base-line for defining caste and understanding the evolution and maintenance of a reproductive division of labour. We review this literature to identify a set of potential molecular signatures that, combined with behavioural, morphological and physiological data, help define caste more precisely; these signatures vary with the type of society, and are likely to be influenced by ecology, life-history, and stage in the colony cycle. We conclude that genomic approaches provide us with additional ways to help quantify and categorise caste, and behaviour in general. "
positive,"Knockdown of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and CYP6MS1 increases the susceptibility of Sitophilus zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. Terpinen-4-ol showed highly insecticidal activity to stored-grain pest Sitophilus zeamais, and cytochrome P450s were strongly induced in response to terpinen-4-ol fumigation. Understanding of the function of P450 enzyme system in the susceptibility to terpinen-4-ol in S. zeamais will benefit the potential application of terpinen-4-ol in controlling stored-grain pests. In the present study, the synergist piperonyl butoxide increased the toxicity of terpinen-4-ol to S. zeamais, with a synergism ratio of 3.5-fold. Two isoforms of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (SzCPR) were identified, with the difference at the N-terminal. SzCPR contained an N-terminal membrane anchor, FMN, FAD, and NADP binding domains. Expression levels of SzCPR were upregulated by tea tree oil (TTO) and its main constituent terpinen-4-ol under different concentrations and time periods. RNAi was generated for S. zeamais by feeding adults dsRNA and the knockdown of SzCPR increased the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol, with higher mortality of adults than control under terpinen-4-ol fumigation. Further RNAi analysis showed that P450 gene CYP6MS1 mediated the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. These results revealed that cytochrome P450 enzyme system, especially CYP6MS1 participated in the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. The findings provided a foundation to clarify the metabolic mechanisms of terpinen-4-ol in stored-grain pests. "
negative,"Insight into the genetic components of community genetics: QTL mapping of insect association in a fast-growing forest tree. Identifying genetic sequences underlying insect associations on forest trees will improve the understanding of community genetics on a broad scale. We tested for genomic regions associated with insects in hybrid poplar using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses conducted on data from a common garden experiment. The F2 offspring of a hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides) cross were assessed for seven categories of insect leaf damage at two time points, June and August. Positive and negative correlations were detected among damage categories and between sampling times. For example, sap suckers on leaves in June were positively correlated with sap suckers on leaves (P<0.001) but negatively correlated with skeletonizer damage (P<0.01) in August. The seven forms of leaf damage were used as a proxy for seven functional groups of insect species. Significant variation in insect association occurred among the hybrid offspring, including transgressive segregation of susceptibility to damage. NMDS analyses revealed significant variation and modest broad-sense heritability in insect community structure among genets. QTL analyses identified 14 genomic regions across 9 linkage groups that correlated with insect association. We used three genomics tools to test for putative mechanisms underlying the QTL. First, shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway genes co-located to 9 of the 13 QTL tested, consistent with the role of phenolic glycosides as defensive compounds. Second, two insect association QTL corresponded to genomic hotspots for leaf trait QTL as identified in previous studies, indicating that, in addition to biochemical attributes, leaf morphology may influence insect preference. Third, network analyses identified categories of gene models over-represented in QTL for certain damage types, providing direction for future functional studies. These results provide insight into the genetic components involved in insect community structure in a fast-growing forest tree.  "
negative,"Complete mitochondrial genome of Taharana fasciana (Insecta, Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and comparison with other Cicadellidae insects. Here, we describe the first complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of the leafhopper Taharana fasciana (Coelidiinae). The mitogenome sequence contains 15,161 bp with an A + T content of 77.9%. It includes 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one non-coding (A + T-rich) region; in addition, a repeat region is also present (GenBank accession no. KY886913). These genes / regions are in the same order as in the inferred insect ancestral mitogenome. All protein-coding genes have ATN as the start codon, and TAA or single T as the stop codons, except the gene ND3, which ends with TAG. Furthermore, we predicted the secondary structures of the rRNAs in T. fasciana. Six domains (domain III is absent in arthropods) and 41 helices were predicted for 16S rRNA, and 12S rRNA comprised three structural domains and 24 helices. Phylogenetic tree analysis confirmed that T. fasciana and other members of the Cicadellidae are clustered into a clade, and it identified the relationships among the subfamilies Deltocephalinae, Coelidiinae, Idiocerinae, Cicadellinae, and Typhlocybinae. "
negative,"Profile of the mosaic element BTMR1 in the genome of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Co-evolution involving a mariner transposon, Botmar1 and the other repeats contained in the Bombus terrestris genome was investigated. We found that the 5'-region of Botmar1 forms one of the components of a mosaic element, known as B. terrestris mosaic repeat 1 (BTMR1), which is also composed of inner segments originating from two different retrotransposons and a pseudogene corresponding to an RNA methyltransferase cDNA. The fact that BTMR1 is interspersed within chromosomes and the differences in its abundance in different species indicate that it is very probably a mobile element. Nevertheless, the absences of direct or inverted repeats at its ends and of target site duplication indicate that its mobility is not ensured by a cardinal transposable element, but putatively by a Crypton-like element. "
negative,"Genome of the African cassava whitefly Bemisia tabaci and distribution and genetic diversity of cassava-colonizing whiteflies in Africa. The whitefy Bemisia tabaci, a species complex consisting of many morphologically indistinguishable species divided into distinct clades, is one of the most globally important agricultural pests and plant virus vectors. Cassava-colonizing B. tabaci transmits viruses that cause cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). Half of all cassava plants in Africa are affected by these viral diseases, resulting in annual production losses of more than US$ 1 billion. Here we report the draft genome of the cassava whitefly B. tabaci Sub-Saharan Africa - East and Central Africa (SSA-ECA), the super-abundant population that has been associated with the rapid spread of viruses causing the pandemics of CMD and CBSD. The SSA-ECA genome assembled from Illumina short reads has a total size of 513.7 Mb and a scaffold N50 length of 497 kb, and contains 15,084 predicted protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SSA-ECA diverged from MEAM1 around 5.26 million years ago. A comprehensive genetic analysis of cassava-colonizing B. tabaci in Africa was also conducted, in which a total of 243 whitefly specimens were collected from 18 countries representing all major cassava-growing regions in the continent and genotyped using NextRAD sequencing. Population genomic analyses confirmed the existence of six major populations linked by gene flow and inferred the distribution patterns of these populations across the African continent. The genome of SSA-ECA and the genetic findings provide valuable resources and guidance to facilitate whitefly research and the development of strategies to control cassava viral diseases spread by whiteflies. "
negative,"Molecular cloning and characterization of a putative proline dehydrogenase gene in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Leptinotarsa decemlineata adults exhibit a season-dependent activity. In spring, post-diapause beetles often fly a long distance from overwintering sites to potato fields. In summer and autumn, the flight ability is sharply reduced. Proline is the main energy substrate of L. decemlineata during flight and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) catalyzes the first step in proline catabolism. Here we identified a putative LdProDH gene; it had three cDNA isoforms which shared the same 5'UTR and coding region, but differed in the lengths of 3'UTRs (515, 1 092 and 1 242 bp for isoforms-1, -2 and -3, respectively). LdProDH encoded a 616 amino acid protein that showed high sequence similarity to ProDH-like proteins from other insect species. LdProDH was expressed in the third and fourth instars larvae and adults, but not in pupae. Dietary ingestion of bacterially expressed LdProDH-dsRNA by adults significantly decreased its messenger RNA (mRNA) level, and caused an elevation of free proline content in the hemolymph. Further observation revealed that three canonical polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were tandemly located in the 3'UTR of isoform-3. The first, second and third polyadenylation sites gave rise to isoforms-1, -2 and -3, respectively. Analysis of the genomic DNA uncovered that the three isoforms resulted from alternative polyadenylation. The mRNA level of isoform-1, which expressed at low levels in pre-diapause adults, became abundant in post-diapause beetles. It is indicated that the LdProDH expression is fine-tuned through 3'UTR to control proline catabolism for the season-dependent activity of L. decemlineata adults. "
negative,"Analysis of SSH library of rice variety Aganni reveals candidate gall midge resistance genes. The Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae, is a serious insect pest causing extensive yield loss. Interaction between the gall midge and rice genotypes is known to be on a gene-for-gene basis. Here, we report molecular basis of HR- (hypersensitive reaction-negative) type of resistance in Aganni (an indica rice variety possessing gall midge resistance gene Gm8) through the construction and analysis of a suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA library. In all, 2,800 positive clones were sequenced and analyzed. The high-quality ESTs were assembled into 448 non-redundant gene sequences. Homology search with the NCBI databases, using BlastX and BlastN, revealed that 73% of the clones showed homology to genes with known function and majority of ESTs belonged to the gene ontology category 'biological process'. Validation of 27 putative candidate gall midge resistance genes through real-time PCR, following gall midge infestation, in contrasting parents and their derived pre-NILs (near isogenic lines) revealed induction of specific genes related to defense and metabolism. Interestingly, four genes, belonging to families of leucine-rich repeat (LRR), heat shock protein (HSP), pathogenesis related protein (PR), and NAC domain-containing protein, implicated in conferring HR+ type of resistance, were found to be up-regulated in Aganni. Two of the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)-scavenging-enzyme-coding genes Cytosolic Ascorbate Peroxidase1, 2 (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2) were found up-regulated in Aganni in incompatible interaction possibly suppressing HR. We suggest that Aganni has a deviant form of inducible, salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance but without HR.  "
negative,"Aphid Transmission Alters the Genomic and Defective RNA Populations of Citrus tristeza virus Isolates. ABSTRACT A total of 14 Spanish isolates of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and 1 isolate from Japan were transmitted by Aphis gossypii, and the subisolates obtained were compared with the source isolates for symptom expression and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) pattern. Of the 14 Spanish isolates, 9 showed altered dsRNA patterns after aphid transmission but only minor variations in the intensity of symptoms induced on Mexican lime. Northern blot hybridization with complementary DNA (cDNA) probes corresponding to both the 5' and the 3' termini of the CTV genomic RNA (gRNA) showed that the dsRNA bands that could be used to discriminate between the dsRNA pattern of the source and the aphid-transmitted isolates were the replicative forms of defective RNAs (D-RNAs). Conversely, the Japanese isolate and two subisolates obtained from it by aphid transmission had the same dsRNA pattern, but one of the subisolates induced milder symptoms in several hosts. Dot-blot hybridization with cDNA probes representing several regions of the gRNA showed that most of the aphid-transmitted isolates differed from the corresponding source isolate by their hybridization pattern. Our results indicate that aphid transmission often sorts the populations of gRNA variants and D-RNAs present in CTV isolates. "
positive,"Transcription factors CncC / Maf and AhR / ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GSTs conferring resistance to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in Spodoptera exigua. BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of multifunctional dimeric proteins existing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in the detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles, including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GST genes in insects are poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified at least three GST genes involved in resistance to the insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that three GSTs (SeGSTo2, SeGSTe6 and SeGSTd3) harbor the same cap 'n' collar C / muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (CncC / Maf) binding site, and SeGSTo2 and SeGSTe6 contain the aryl hydrocarbon receptor / aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (AhR / ARNT) binding site. Luciferase reporter assay showed co-transfection of reporter plasmid containing the SeGSTe6 promoter with CncC and / or Maf expressing constructs significantly boosted transcription. Similarly, AhR and / or ARNT expressing constructs also significantly increased the promoter activities. The co-transfection of mutated reporter plasmid with CncC / Maf or AhR / ARNT did not increase transcription activity anymore. Constitutive over-expression of CncC, Maf and AhR was also found in the HZ16 strain, which might be the molecular mechanism for up-regulated expression of multiple detoxification genes conferring resistance to insecticides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CncC / Maf and AhR / ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GST genes involved in insecticide resistance in Spodoptera exigua. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Copper-induced H2O2 accumulation confers larval tolerance to xanthotoxin by modulating CYP6B50 expression in Spodoptera litura. In the plant-insect arms race, plants synthesize toxic compounds to defend against herbivorous insects, whereas insects employ cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) to detoxify these phytotoxins. As ubiquitous environmental contaminants, heavy metals can be easily absorbed by plants and further accumulated in herbivorous insects through the food chains, resulting in tangible consequences for plant-insect interactions. However, whether heavy metals can influence P450 activities and thereby cause further effects on larval tolerance to phytotoxins remains unknown. In this study, we shown that prior exposure to copper (Cu) enhanced larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in Spodoptera litura, a major polyphagous pest of agriculture. P450 activities were induced in larvae exposed to Cu or xanthotoxin, and a midgut specific expressed P450 gene, CYP6B50 was cross-induced after exposure to these two toxic xenobiotics. Knocking down CYP6B50 by RNA interference (RNAi) rendered the larvae more sensitive to xanthotoxin. As defense against oxidative stress following metal exposure has been demonstrated to affect insecticide resistance, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed. Cu exposure caused the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in larval midgut. In addition, two antioxidant response elements (AREs) were identified from the CYP6B50 promoter, indicating that Cu-induced CYP6B50 expression may be related to the ROS burst. Application of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively suppressed CYP6B50 expression, inhibited P450 activities and impaired larval tolerance to xanthotoxin that had been induced by Cu. These results indicate that the increase in CYP6B50 expression regulated by Cu-induced H2O2 generation contributed to the enhancement of larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in S. litura. Ingestion of heavy metals from their host plants can inadvertently boost the counter-defense system of herbivorous insects to protect themselves against plant defensive toxins. "
positive,"A caspase-like decoy molecule enhances the activity of a paralogous caspase in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles in apoptosis and other key cellular processes. A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity. The discovery of potential caspase-like decoy molecules in several insect species opens new avenues for investigating caspase regulation in insects, particularly in disease vectors such as mosquitoes. "
positive,"The expression analysis of silk gland-enriched intermediate-size non-coding RNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori. Small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. Silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of Lepidopterous pests. We have previously identified 189 novel intermediate-size ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori, including 40 ncRNAs that showed altered expression in different developmental stages. Here we characterized the functions of these 40 ncRNAs by measuring their expressions in six tissues of the fifth instar larvae using Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. We identified nine ncRNAs (four small nucleolar RNAs and five unclassified ncRNAs) that were enriched in silk gland, including four ncRNAs that showed silk gland-specific expression. We further showed that three of nine silk gland-enriched ncRNAs were predominantly expressed in the anterior silk gland, whereas another three ncRNAs were highly accumulated in the posterior silk gland, suggesting that they may play different roles in fibroin synthesis. Furthermore, an unclassified ncRNA, Bm-152, exhibited converse expression pattern with its antisense host gene gartenzwerg in diverse tissues, and might regulate the expression of gartenzwerg through RNA-protein complex. In addition, two silk gland-enriched ncRNAs Bm-102 and Bm-159 can be found in histone modification complex, which indicated that they might play roles through epigenetic modifications. Taken together, we provided the first expression and preliminary functional analysis of silk gland-enriched ncRNAs, which will help understand the molecular mechanism of silk gland-development and fibroin synthesis.

negative,"Data for constructing insect genome content matrices for phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation. Twenty one fully sequenced and well annotated insect genomes were used to construct genome content matrices for phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation of insect genomes. To examine the role of e-value cutoff in ortholog determination we used scaled e-value cutoffs and a single linkage clustering approach.. The present communication includes (1) a list of the genomes used to construct the genome content phylogenetic matrices, (2) a nexus file with the data matrices used in phylogenetic analysis, (3) a nexus file with the Newick trees generated by phylogenetic analysis, (4) an excel file listing the Core (CORE) genes and Unique (UNI) genes found in five insect groups, and (5) a figure showing a plot of consistency index (CI) versus percent of unannotated genes that are apomorphies in the data set for gene losses and gains and bar plots of gains and losses for four consistency index (CI) cutoffs.

negative,"Screening and Functional Analyses of Nilaparvata lugens Salivary Proteome. Most phloem-feeding insects secrete gelling and watery saliva during the feeding process. However, the functions of salivary proteins are poorly understood. In this study, our purpose was to reveal the components and functions of saliva in a rice sap-sucking insect pest, Nilaparvata lugens. The accomplishment of the whole genome and transcriptome sequencing in N. lugens would be helpful for elucidating the gene information and expression specificity of the salivary proteins. In this study, we have, for the first time, identified the abundant protein components from gelling and watery saliva in a monophagous sap-sucking insect species through shotgun proteomic detection combined with the genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Eight unknown secreted proteins were limited to N. lugens, indicating species-specific saliva components. A group of annexin-like proteins first identified in the secreted saliva displayed different domain structure and expression specificity with typical insect annexins. Nineteen genes encoding five annexin-like proteins, six salivaps (salivary glands-specific proteins with unknown function), seven putative enzymes, and a mucin-like protein showed salivary gland-specific expression pattern, suggesting their importance in the physiological mechanisms of salivary gland and saliva in this insect species. RNA interference revealed that salivap-3 is a key protein factor in forming the salivary sheath, while annexin-like5 and carbonic anhydrase are indispensable for N. lugens survival. These novel findings will greatly help to clarify the detailed functions of salivary proteins in the physiological process of N. lugens and elucidate the interaction mechanisms between N. lugens and the rice plant, which could provide important targets for the future management of rice pests. "
positive,"Function and pharmacology of glutamate-gated chloride channel exon 9 splice variants from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) are found only in invertebrates and mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission. The structural and functional diversity of GluCls are produced through assembly of multiple subunits and via posttranscriptional alternations. Alternative splicing is the most common way to achieve this in insect GluCls and splicing occurs primarily at exons 3 and 9. As expression pattern and pharmacological properties of exon 9 alternative splices in invertebrate GluCls remain poorly understood, the cDNAs encoding three alternative splice variants (9a, 9b and 9c) of the PxGluCl gene from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella were constructed and their pharmacological characterizations were examined using electrophysiological studies. Alternative splicing of exon 9 had little to no impact on PxGluCl sensitivity towards the agonist glutamate when subunits were singly or co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, the allosteric modulator abamectin and the chloride channel blocker fipronil had differing effects on PxGluCl splice variants. PxGluCl9c channels were more resistant to abamectin and PxGluCl9b channels were more sensitive to fipronil than other homomeric channels. In addition, heteromeric channels containing different splice variants showed similar sensitivity to abamectin (except for 9c) and reduced sensitivity to fipronil than homomeric channels. These findings suggest that functionally indistinguishable but pharmacologically distinct GluCls could be formed in P. xylostella and that the upregulated constitutive expression of the specific variants may contribute to the evolution of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella and other arthropods. "
negative,"Virus-independent and common transcriptome responses of leafhopper vectors feeding on maize infected with semi-persistently and persistent propagatively transmitted viruses. BACKGROUND: Insects are the most important epidemiological factors for plant virus disease spread, with >75% of viruses being dependent on insects for transmission to new hosts. The black-faced leafhopper (Graminella nigrifrons Forbes) transmits two viruses that use different strategies for transmission: Maize chlorotic dwarf virus (MCDV) which is semi-persistently transmitted and Maize fine streak virus (MFSV) which is persistently and propagatively transmitted. To date, little is known regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms in insects that regulate the process and efficiency of transmission, or how these mechanisms differ based on virus transmission strategy. RESULTS: RNA-Seq was used to examine transcript changes in leafhoppers after feeding on MCDV-infected, MFSV-infected and healthy maize for 4 h and 7 d. After sequencing cDNA libraries constructed from whole individuals using Illumina next generation sequencing, the Rnnotator pipeline in Galaxy was used to reassemble the G. nigrifrons transcriptome. Using differential expression analyses, we identified significant changes in transcript abundance in G. nigrifrons. In particular, transcripts implicated in the innate immune response and energy production were more highly expressed in insects fed on virus-infected maize. Leafhoppers fed on MFSV-infected maize also showed an induction of transcripts involved in hemocoel and cell-membrane linked immune responses within four hours of feeding. Patterns of transcript expression were validated for a subset of transcripts by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using RNA samples collected from insects fed on healthy or virus-infected maize for between a 4 h and seven week period. CONCLUSIONS: We expected, and found, changes in transcript expression in G. nigrifrons feeding of maize infected with a virus (MFSV) that also infects the leafhopper, including induction of immune responses in the hemocoel and at the cell membrane. The significant induction of the innate immune system in G. nigrifrons fed on a foregut-borne virus (MCDV) that does not infect leafhoppers was less expected. The changes in transcript accumulation that occur independent of the mode of pathogen transmission could be key for identifying insect factors that disrupt vector-mediated plant virus transmission. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification of cuticular protein genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Many kinds of cuticular proteins are found in a single insect species and their numbers and features are diversified among insects. Because there are so many cuticular proteins and so much sequence variation among them, an overview of cuticular protein gene is needed. Recently, a complete silkworm genome sequence was obtained through the integration of data from two whole genome sequence projects performed independently in 2004. To identify cuticular protein genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori exhaustively, we searched both the Bombyx whole genome sequence as well as various EST libraries, and found 220 putative cuticular protein genes. We also revised the annotation of the gene model, and named each identified cuticular protein based on its motif. The phylogenetic tree of cuticular protein genes among B. mori, Drosophila melanogaster, and Apis mellifera revealed that duplicate cuticular protein clusters have evolved independently among insects. Comparison of EST libraries and northern blot analyses showed that the tissue- and stage-specific expression of each gene was intricately regulated, even between adjacent genes in the same gene cluster. This study reveals many novel cuticular protein genes as well as insights into cuticular protein gene regulation. "
negative,"Insect-resistant biotech crops and their impacts on beneficial arthropods. With a projected population of 10 billion by 2050, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve increased crop yields in a sustainable and cost-effective way. The concept of using a transgenic approach was realized in the mid-1990s with the commercial introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops. By 2010, the global value of the seed alone was US $11.2 billion, with commercial biotech maize, soya bean grain and cotton valued at approximately US $150 billion. In recent years, it has become evident that insect-resistant crops expressing δ-endotoxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have made a significant beneficial impact on global agriculture, not least in terms of pest reduction and improved quality. However, because of the potential for pest populations to evolve resistance, and owing to lack of effective control of homopteran pests, alternative strategies are being developed. Some of these are based on Bacillus spp. or other insect pathogens, while others are based on the use of plant- and animal-derived genes. However, if such approaches are to play a useful role in crop protection, it is desirable that they do not have a negative impact on beneficial organisms at higher trophic levels thus affecting the functioning of the agro-ecosystem. This widely held concern over the ecological impacts of GM crops has led to the extensive examination of the potential effects of a range of transgene proteins on non-target and beneficial insects. The findings to date with respect to both commercial and experimental GM crops expressing anti-insect genes are discussed here, with particular emphasis on insect predators and parasitoids. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the plant bug Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae): Presently known as the smallest in Heteroptera. The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of the plant bug, Apolygus lucorum, an important cotton pest, has been sequenced and annotated in this study. The entire circular genome is 14 768 bp in size and represents the smallest in presently known heteropteran mt genomes. The mt genome is encoding for two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 13 protein coding genes and a control region, and the order, content, codon usage and base organization show similarity to a great extent to the hypothetical ancestral model. All protein coding genes use standard initiation codons ATN. Conventional stop codons TAA and TAG have been assigned to the most protein coding genes; however, COIII, ND4 and ND5 genes show incomplete terminator signal (T). All tRNA genes possess the typical clover leaf structure, but the dihydrouridine arm of tRNA(Ser(AGN)) only forms a simple loop. Secondary structure models of rRNA genes are generally in accordance with the former models, although some differences exist in certain parts. Three intergenic spacers have never been found in sequenced mt genomes of Heteroptera. The phylogenetic study based on protein coding genes is largely congruent with previous phylogenetic work. Both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses highly support the sister relationship of A. lucorum and Lygus lineolaris, and Miridae presents a sister position to Anthocoridae. "
negative,"Comparative genomic analysis and evolution of family-B G protein-coupled receptors from six model insect species. Family-B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR-Bs) play vital roles in many biological processes, including growth, development and reproduction. However, the evolution and function of GPCR-Bs have been poorly understood in insects. We have identified 87 GPCR-Bs from six model insect species, 20 from Tribolium castaneum, 9 from Apis mellifera, 11 from Bombyx mori, 9 from Acyrthosiphon pisum, 14 from Anopheles gambiae and 24 from Drosophila melanogaster. 22 of them were reported in this study for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there are three kinds of evolutionary patterns that occurred among GPCR-Bs during insect evolution: one-to-one orthologous relationships, species-specific expansion and episodic duplication or loss in certain insect lineages. A striking finding was the discovery of a parathyroid hormone receptor like gene (pthrl) in invertebrates, which was independently duplicated in vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas this gene was lost at least twice during insect evolution. These results indicate that PTHRL is possibly divergent in the functions between mammals and insects. The information of family-B GPCRs in nondrosophiline insects has been established, and will promote the further study on the function of these GPCRs and deorphanization of them. On the other hand, this study provides us with multiple function of GPCR-Bs in differential organisms, which will be also the potential attacking targets for new pesticides and drugs. "
negative,"Structural cuticular proteins from arthropods: annotation, nomenclature, and sequence characteristics in the genomics era. The availability of whole genome sequences of several arthropods has provided new insights into structural cuticular proteins (CPs), in particular the distribution of different families, the recognition that these proteins may comprise almost 2% of the protein coding genes of some species, and the identification of features that should aid in the annotation of new genomes and EST libraries as they become available. Twelve CP families are described: CPR (named after the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus); CPF (named because it has a highly conserved region consisting of about forty-four amino acids); CPFL (like the CPFs in a conserved C-terminal region); the TWDL family, named after a picturesque phenotype of one mutant member; four families in addition to TWDL with a preponderance of low complexity sequence that are not member of the families listed above. These were named after particular diagnostic features as CPLCA, CPLCG, CPLCW, CPLCP. There are also CPG, a lepidopteran family with an abundance of glycines, the apidermin family, named after three proteins in Apis mellifera, and CPAP1 and CPAP3, named because they have features analogous to peritrophins, namely one or three chitin-binding domains. Also described are common motifs and features. Four unusual CPs are discussed in detail. Data that facilitated the analysis of sequence variation of single CP genes in natural populations are analyzed. "
positive,"UDP-Glycosyltransferases are involved in imidacloprid resistance in the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Lividae). UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), as phase II detoxification enzymes, are widely distributed within living organisms and play vital roles in the biotransformation of endobiotics and xenobiotics in insects. Insects increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress of xenobiotics, including insecticides. However, the roles of UGTs in insecticide resistance are still seldom reported. In this study, two UGT inhibitors, namely, 5-nitrouracil and sulfinpyrazone, were found to synergistically increase the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population of Diaphorina citri. Based on transcriptome data, a total of 17 putative UGTs were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that fourteen of the 17 UGT genes were overexpressed in the resistant population relative to the susceptible population. Using RNA interference technology to knockdown six UGT genes, the results suggested that silencing the selected UGT375A1, UGT383A1, UGT383B1, and UGT384A1 genes dramatically increased the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. However, silencing the UGT362B1 and UGT379A1 genes did not result in a significant increase in the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. These findings revealed that some upregulated UGT genes were involved in imidacloprid resistance in D. citri. These results shed some light upon and further our understanding of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance in insects. "
positive,"Feeding-based RNA interference of a trehalose phosphate synthase gene in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is the most devastating rice insect pest to have given rise to an outbreak in recent years. RNA interference (RNAi) is a technological breakthrough that has been developed as a powerful tool for studying gene function and for the highly targeted control of insect pests. Here, we examined the effects of using a feeding-based RNAi technique to target the gene trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS) in N. lugens. The full-length cDNA of N. lugens TPS (NlTPS) is 3235 bp and has an open reading frame of 2424 bp, encoding a protein of 807 amino acids. NlTPS was expressed in the fat body, midgut and ovary. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that NlTPS mRNA is expressed continuously with little change during the life of the insect. Efficient silencing of the TPS gene through double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) feeding led to rapid and significant reduction levels of TPS mRNA and enzymatic activity. Additionally, the development of N. lugens larvae that had been fed with the dsRNA was disturbed, resulting in lethality, and the cumulative survival rates dropped to 75.56, 64.44, 55.56 and 40.00% after continuous ingestion of 0.5 µg / µl dsRNA for 2, 4, 7 and 10 days, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those of the insects in the control group, suggesting that NlTPS dsRNA may be useful as a means of insect pest control. "
negative,"The last bastion? X chromosome genotyping of Anopheles gambiae species pair males from a hybrid zone reveals complex recombination within the major candidate 'genomic island of speciation'. Speciation with gene flow may be aided by reduced recombination helping to build linkage between genes involved in the early stages of reproductive isolation. Reduced recombination on chromosome X has been implicated in speciation within the Anopheles gambiae complex, species of which represent the major Afrotropical malaria vectors. The most recently diverged, morphologically indistinguishable, species pair, A. gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, ubiquitously displays a 'genomic island of divergence' spanning over 4 Mb from chromosome X centromere, which represents a particularly promising candidate region for reproductive isolation genes, in addition to containing the diagnostic markers used to distinguish the species. Very low recombination makes the island intractable for experimental recombination studies, but an extreme hybrid zone in Guinea Bissau offers the opportunity for natural investigation of X-island recombination. SNP analysis of chromosome X hemizygous males revealed: (i) strong divergence in the X-island despite a lack of autosomal divergence; (ii) individuals with multiple-recombinant genotypes, including likely double crossovers and localized gene conversion; (iii) recombination-driven discontinuity both within and between the molecular species markers, suggesting that the utility of the diagnostics is undermined under high hybridization. The largely, but incompletely protected nature of the X centromeric genomic island is consistent with a primary candidate area for accumulation of adaptive variants driving speciation with gene flow, while permitting some selective shuffling and removal of genetic variation. "
negative,"The mitochondrial control region of blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae): a hot spot for mitochondrial genome rearrangements. The family Calliphoridae consists of myiasis-causing flies, including species of economic, forensic, and medical importance. In this study, the complete control regions (CRs) of mitochondrial DNA from 15 calliphorid species were sequenced and structurally characterized. The CRs had a high content of adenines (A) and thymines (T) and varied in length from 854 to 2,018 bp, showing intraspecific variations in sequence and length. Two major domains were identified: the conserved domain containing conserved sequence blocks and cis-regulatory structures that may be related to the transcription and the origin of replication of mitochondrial DNA, and the variable domain, containing high sequence and length variation. Within the variable domain, duplication of the tRNA(Ile) gene, previously reported for three Chrysomya species, was identified in two more species of this genus and in two species of two other genera. The structural characterization shows the plasticity of the mitochondrial genome in dipterans. The organizational similarities of the duplicated region found in different species and the possible origin of the duplicated genes are discussed. "
negative,"Genomic inference accurately predicts the timing and severity of a recent bottleneck in a nonmodel insect population. The analysis of molecular data from natural populations has allowed researchers to answer diverse ecological questions that were previously intractable. In particular, ecologists are often interested in the demographic history of populations, information that is rarely available from historical records. Methods have been developed to infer demographic parameters from genomic data, but it is not well understood how inferred parameters compare to true population history or depend on aspects of experimental design. Here, we present and evaluate a method of SNP discovery using RNA sequencing and demographic inference using the program δaδi, which uses a diffusion approximation to the allele frequency spectrum to fit demographic models. We test these methods in a population of the checkerspot butterfly Euphydryas gillettii. This population was intentionally introduced to Gothic, Colorado in 1977 and has as experienced extreme fluctuations including bottlenecks of fewer than 25 adults, as documented by nearly annual field surveys. Using RNA sequencing of eight individuals from Colorado and eight individuals from a native population in Wyoming, we generate the first genomic resources for this system. While demographic inference is commonly used to examine ancient demography, our study demonstrates that our inexpensive, all-in-one approach to marker discovery and genotyping provides sufficient data to accurately infer the timing of a recent bottleneck. This demographic scenario is relevant for many species of conservation concern, few of which have sequenced genomes. Our results are remarkably insensitive to sample size or number of genomic markers, which has important implications for applying this method to other nonmodel systems.  "
negative,"The piggyBac transposon mediates germ-line transformation in the Oriental fruit fly and closely related elements exist in its genome. Germ-line transformation of a white eye strain of the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, was achieved with the piggyBac vector, derived from a transposon originally isolated from the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni. The vector was marked with the medfly white+ gene cDNA, and three transgenic lines were identified at a frequency of approximately 2% per fertile G0. Vector integrations were verified by Southern DNA hybridization, which also revealed the presence of endogenous genomic elements closely related to piggyBac. Approximately 10-20 elements per genome were evident in several B. dorsalis strains, and sequence analysis of 1.5 kb gene amplification products from two wild strains and the white eye host strain indicated 95% nucleotide and 92% amino acid sequence identity among resident elements and the T. ni element. PiggyBac was not evident by hybridization in other tephritid species, or insects previously transformed with the transposon. This is the first discovery of piggyBac beyond T. ni, and its existence in a distantly related species has important implications for the practical use of the vector and insects transformed with it. "
negative,"Genome-wide annotation and comparative analysis of cuticular protein genes in the noctuid pest Spodoptera litura. Insect cuticle is considered an adaptable and versatile building material with roles in the construction and function of exoskeleton. Its physical properties are varied, as the biological requirements differ among diverse structures and change during the life cycle of the insect. Although the bulk of cuticle consists basically of cuticular proteins (CPs) associated with chitin, the degree of cuticular sclerotization is an important factor in determining its physical properties. Spodoptera litura, the tobacco cutworm, is an important agricultural pest in Asia. Compared to the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori, another lepidopteran whose CP genes have been well annotated, S. litura has a shorter life cycle, hides in soil during daytime beginning in the 5th instar and is exposed to soil in the pupal stage without the protection of a cocoon. In order to understand how the CP genes may have been adapted to support the characteristic life style of S. litura, we searched its genome and found 287 putative cuticular proteins that can be classified into 9 CP families (CPR with three groups (RR-1, RR-2, RR-3), CPAP1, CPAP3, CPF, CPFL, CPT, CPG, CPCFC and CPLCA), and a collection of unclassified CPs named CPH. There were also 112 cuticular proteins enriched in Histidine residues with content varying from 6% to 30%, comprising many more His-rich cuticular proteins than B. mori. A phylogenetic analysis between S. litura, M. sexta and B. mori uncovered large expansions of RR-1 and RR-2 CPs, forming large gene clusters in different regions of S. litura chromosome 9. We used RNA-seq analysis to document the expression profiles of CPs in different developmental stages and tissues of S. litura. The comparative genomic analysis of CPs between S. litura and B. mori integrated with the unique behavior and life cycle of the two species offers new insights into their contrasting ecological adaptations. "
negative,"Cloning and rescue of the genome of Bombyx mori bidensovirus, and characterization of a recombinant virus. BACKGROUND: Bombyx mori bidensovirus (BmBDV), which belongs to the Bidnaviridae family established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2011, was the first bidensovirus identified in insects. The structure of BmBDV is similar to that of parvoviruses, while its replication is similar to that of adenoviruses. Although BmBDV has the potential to be used as a tool in biological pest control and as an expression vector, virus rescue has been a bottleneck in the application of this virus. METHODS: In this study, we constructed a full-length genomic clone of BmBDV and showed that its terminal structure was restored. A recombinant BmBDV that expressed the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was constructed. Then, BmN cells, which are an ovarian cell line, were co-transfected with the linearized genome using continuous culture and expanded cell culture methods. RESULTS: The results showed that the GFP gene was expressed successfully, and that cell lesions occurred in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, typical densonucleosis viruses were observed in reinfected silkworm larvae and larval midgut tissues infected by BmBDV, as evidenced by the emission of green fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the virus could be rescued from the infected BmN cells after co-transfection with the linear full length virus genome. "
positive,"The function of spineless in antenna and wing development of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. A wide array of sensilla are distributed on insect antennae, and they play a variety of important roles. Rice planthoppers, destructive pests on rice, have a unique antenna sensilla structure called the 'sensory plaque organ'. The spineless (ss) gene encodes a bHLH-PAS transcription factor and plays a key role in antenna development. In the current study, a 3029 bp full-length cDNA of the Nilaparvata lugens ss gene (Nlss) was cloned, and it encodes 654 amino acid residues. The highest level of Nlss expression was detected in the thorax of fourth-instar nymphs. Knockdown of Nlss in nymphs led to a decrease in the number and size of plaque organs. Moreover, the flagella of the treated insects were poorly developed, wilted, and even dropped off from the pedicel. Nlss-knockdown also resulted in twisted wings in both long-winged and short-winged brown planthoppers. Y-type olfactometer analyses indicated that antenna defects originating from Nlss depletion resulted in less sensitivity to host volatiles. This study represents the first report of the characteristics and functions of Nlss in N. lugens antenna and wing development and illuminates the function of the plaque organ of N. lugens in host volatile perception. "
negative,"CRISPR / Cas9 mediated genome editing of Helicoverpa armigera with mutations of an ABC transporter gene HaABCA2 confers resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry2A toxins. High levels of resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab have been identified to be genetically linked with loss of function mutations of an ABC transporter gene (ABCA2) in two lepidopteran insects, Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa punctigera. To further confirm the causal relationship between the ABCA2 gene (HaABCA2) and Cry2Ab resistance in H. armigera, two HaABCA2 knockout strains were created from the susceptible SCD strain with the CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing system. One strain (SCD-A2KO1) is homozygous for a 2-bp deletion in exon 2 of HaABCA2 created by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The other strain (SCD-A2KO2) is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 18 of HaABCA2 made by homology-directed repair (HDR), which was produced to mimic the r2 resistance allele of a field-derived Cry2Ab-resistant strain from Australia. Both knockout strains obtained high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa (>120-fold) and Cry2Ab (>100-fold) compared with the original SCD strain, but no or very limited resistance to Cry1Ac (<4-fold). Resistance to Cry2Ab in both knockouts is recessive, and genetic complementary tests confirmed Cry2Ab resistance alleles are at the same locus (i.e. HaABCA2) for the two strains. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of midguts from both knockout strains lost binding with Cry2Ab, but maintained the same binding with Cry1Ac as the SCD strain. In vivo functional evidence from this study demonstrates knockout of HaABCA2 confers high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab, confirming that HaABCA2 plays a key role in mediating toxicity of both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab against H. armigera.

negative,"Genes and genomic processes underpinning the social lives of ants. The >15000 ant species are all highly social and show great variation in colony organization, complexity and behavior. The mechanisms by which such sociality evolved, as well as those underpinning the elaboration of ant societies since their ∼140 million year old common ancestor, have long been pondered. Here, we review recent insights generated using various genomic approaches. This includes understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying caste differentiation and the diversity of social structures, studying the impact of eusociality on genomic evolutionary rates, and investigating gene expression changes associated with differences in lifespan between castes. Furthermore, functional studies involving RNAi and CRISPR have recently been successfully applied to ants, opening the door to exciting research that promises to revolutionize the understanding of the evolution and diversification of social living.

positive,"RNA Interference in the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, Using Plastid-Encoded Long Double-Stranded RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising method for controlling pest insects by silencing the expression of vital insect genes to interfere with development and physiology; however, certain insect Orders are resistant to this process. In this study, we set out to test the ability of in planta-expressed dsRNA synthesized within the plastids to silence gene expression in an insect recalcitrant to RNAi, the lepidopteran species, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). Using the Manduca vacuolar-type H+ ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) gene as the target, we first evaluated RNAi efficiency of two dsRNA products of different lengths by directly feeding the in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs to M. sexta larvae. We found that a long dsRNA of 2222 bp was the most effective in inducing lethality and silencing the v-ATPaseA gene, when delivered orally in a water droplet. We further transformed the plastid genome of the M. sexta host plant, Nicotiana tabacum, to produce this long dsRNA in its plastids and performed bioassays with M. sexta larvae on the transplastomic plants. In the tested insects, the plastid-derived dsRNA had no effect on larval survival and no statistically significant effect on expression of the v-ATPaseA gene was observed. Comparison of the absolute quantities of the dsRNA present in transplastomic leaf tissue for v-ATPaseA and a control gene, GFP, of a shorter size, revealed a lower concentration for the long dsRNA product compared to the short control product. We suggest that stability and length of the dsRNA may have influenced the quantities produced in the plastids, resulting in inefficient RNAi in the tested insects. Our results imply that many factors dictate the effectiveness of in planta RNAi, including a likely trade-off effect as increasing the dsRNA product length may be countered by a reduction in the amount of dsRNA produced and accumulated in the plastids. "
negative,"Characterization of the complete genome segments from BmCPV-SZ, a novel  Bombyx mori  cypovirus 1 isolate. A novel Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 isolated from infected silkworm larvae and tentatively assigned as Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 isolate Suzhou (BmCPV-SZ). The complete nucleotide sequences of genomic segments S1-S10 from BmCPV-SZ were determined. All segments possessed a single open reading frame; however, bioinformatic evidence suggested a short overlapping coding sequence in S1. Each BmCPV-SZ segment possessed the conserved terminal sequences AGUAA and GUUAGCC at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The conserved A / G at the -3 position in relation to the AUG codon could be found in the BmCPV-SZ genome, and it was postulated that this conserved A / G may be the most important nucleotide for efficient translation initiation in cypoviruses (CPVs). Examination of the putative amino acid sequences encoded by BmCPV-SZ revealed some characteristic motifs. Homology searches showed that viral structural proteins VP1, VP3, and VP4 had localized homologies with proteins of Rice ragged stunt virus , a member of the genus Oryzavirus within the family Reoviridae. A phylogenetic tree based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences demonstrated that CPV is more closely related to Rice ragged stunt virus and Aedes pseudoscutellaris reovirus than to other members of Reoviridae, suggesting that they may have originated from common ancestors. "
negative,"From the Cover: Directed, efficient, and versatile modifications of the Drosophila genome by genomic engineering. With the completion of genome sequences of major model organisms, increasingly sophisticated genetic tools are necessary for investigating the complex and coordinated functions of genes. Here we describe a genetic manipulation system termed ""genomic engineering"" in Drosophila. Genomic engineering is a 2-step process that combines the ends-out (replacement) gene targeting with phage integrase phiC31-mediated DNA integration. First, through an improved and modified gene targeting method, a founder knock-out line is generated by deleting the target gene and replacing it with an integration site of phiC31. Second, DNA integration by phiC31 is used to reintroduce modified target-gene DNA into the native locus in the founder knock-out line. Genomic engineering permits directed and highly efficient modifications of a chosen genomic locus into virtually any desired mutant allele. We have successfully applied the genomic engineering scheme on 6 different genes and have generated at their loci more than 70 unique alleles. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers from the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata: cross-species amplification in other Tephritidae species reveals a varying degree of transferability. The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is a pest of major economic importance and has become a model for the development of SIT control programs for insect pests. Significant information has been accumulated on classical and population genetics of this species during the past 2 decades. However, the availability of molecular markers is limited. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of 159 microsatellite clones and the development of 108 polymorphic microsatellite markers for this insect pest. Mapping by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of 21 microsatellite clones enriched the cytogenetic map that was previously constructed by our group. The enriched map provides a large number of STSs for future genome mapping projects. Cross-species amplification of these microsatellite loci in 12 Tephritidae species and sequence analysis of several amplification products indicated a varying degree of transferability and their possible usefulness as molecular and genetic markers in these species where genetic and molecular tools are limited. "
negative,"The genome sequence of a novel RNA virus in Adelphocoris suturalis. The complete genome of a novel virus found in Adelphocoris suturalis was determined by RNA-seq and named Adelphocoris suturalis-associated virus 1 (ASV1). ASV1 has a single-stranded RNA genome of 10,845 nucleotides in length and contains five putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a polypeptide of 2592 amino acids (aa) and contains four conserved domains: a viral RNA methyltransferase domain, an FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain, a viral RNA helicase domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 encode polypeptides of 190, 461, 103 and 159 aa, respectively, of which only ORF5 contains a conserved domain, the Tobacco mosaic virus-coat superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis with the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that ASV1 clusters with the Drosophila-related Boutonnet virus. The similar genomic structure and high bootstrap value identified in the maximum-likelihood tree suggest that ASV1 (possibly alongside Boutonnet virus) could be considered the prototype of a new taxon of unclassified insect viruses. The prevalence of ASV1 infection in wild populations of A. suturalis was at a low level (6.60%, 14 positives from 212 samples). "
negative,"Distribution of Anopheles daciae and other Anopheles maculipennis complex species in Serbia. Malaria is one of the most severe health problems facing the world today. Until the mid-twentieth century, Europe was an endemic area of malaria, with the Balkan countries being heavily infested. Sibling species belonging to the Anopheles maculipennis complex are well-known as effective vectors of Plasmodium in Europe. A vast number of human malaria cases in the past in the former Yugoslavia territory have stressed the significance of An. maculipennis complex species as primary and secondary vectors. Therefore, the present study evaluates the species composition, geographic distribution and abundance of these malaria vector species. Mosquitoes were collected in the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina and analysed by PCR-RFLP, multiplex PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 intron of genomic rDNA. Four sibling species of the An. maculipennis complex were identified. Both larvae and adults of the recently described species An. daciae were identified for the first time in Serbia. In 250 larval samples, 109 (44%) An. messeae, 90 (36%) An. maculipennis s.s., 33 (13%) An. daciae and 18 (7%) An. atroparvus were identified. In adult collections, 81 (47%) An. messeae, 55 (32%) An. daciae, 33 (19%) An. maculipennis s.s., and 3 (2%) An. atroparvus were recorded. The most abundant species in Vojvodina was An. messeae, whereas An. atroparvus was confirmed a rare species in all parts. Since this species is a potentially, highly competent malarial vector, low population density could be crucial to prevent a new establishment of endemic malaria transmission in Serbia. "
positive,"Wing defects in Drosophila xenicid mutant clones are caused by C-terminal deletion of additional sex combs (Asx). BACKGROUND: The coordinated action of genes that control patterning, cell fate determination, cell size, and cell adhesion is required for proper wing formation in Drosophila. Defects in any of these basic processes can lead to wing aberrations, including blisters. The xenicid mutation was originally identified in a screen designed to uncover regulators of adhesion between wing surfaces [1]. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrate that expression of the betaPS integrin or the patterning protein Engrailed are not affected in developing wing imaginal discs in xenicid mutants. Instead, expression of the homeotic protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is strongly increased in xenicid mutant cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of Ubx transforms cells from a wing blade fate to a haltere fate, and that the presence of haltere cells within the wing blade is the primary defect leading to the adult wing phenotypes observed. "
negative,"De novo transcriptome analysis and highly sensitive digital gene expression profiling of Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) pupae using MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). Determining a post-mortem interval using the weight or length of blow fly larvae to calculate the insect's age is well established. However, to date, there are only a handful studies dealing with age estimation of blow fly pupae, in which weight or length cannot be used as a relevant parameter. The analysis of genetic markers, which indicate a certain developmental stage, can extend the period for a successful post-mortem interval determination. In order to break new ground in the field of age determination of forensic relevant blow flies, we performed a de novo transcriptome analysis of Calliphora vicina pupae at 15 different developmental stages. Obtained data serve as base to establish molecular age determination techniques. We used a new, deeper, and more cost-effective digital gene expression profiling method called MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). We generated 15 libraries out of 15 developmental stages, with 3-8 million reads per library. In total, 53,539 distinct transcripts were detected, and 7548 were annotated to known insect genes. The analysis provides high-resolution gene expression profiles of all covered transcripts, which were used to identify differentially expressed genetic markers as candidates for a molecular age estimation of C. vicina pupae. Moreover, the analysis allows insights into gene activity of pupal development and the relationship between different genes interesting for insect development in general.  "
negative,"Expression of heterologous promoters in Lutzomyia longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae) cell lines. To establish a transient expression system for genes introduced into sand fly cell lines, we tested the expression of the luciferase reporter gene under control of different promoters. Towards this end, we lipofected cell lines obtained from New and Old World sand flies, LL-5 from Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Neiva and PP-9 from Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli, respectively. The relative levels of luciferase expression were studied under control of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), human cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40 or Junonia coenia (Hübner) densovirus (P9) promoters. The Drosophila heat shock protein 70 promoter, originating from insect genes, functioned as a strong promoter in both cell lines. Promoters from the different virus genes also were capable of driving transgene expression in both cell lines. "
negative,"Tangible benefits of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genome sequencing for aphid proteomics: Enhancements in protein identification and data validation for homology-based proteomics. Homology-driven proteomics promises to reveal functional biology in insects with sparse genome sequence information. A proteomics study comparing plant virus transmission competent and refractive genotypes of the aphid Schizaphis graminum isolated numerous candidate proteins involved in virus transmission, but limited genome sequence information hampered their identification. The complete genome of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, released in 2008, enabled us to double the number of protein identifications beyond what was possible using available EST libraries and other insect sequences. This was concomitant with a dramatic increase of the number of MS and MS / MS peptide spectra matching the genome-derived protein sequence. LC-MS / MS proved to be the most robust method of peptide detection. Cross-matching spectral data to multiple EST sequences and error tolerant searching to identify amino acid substitutions enhanced the percent coverage of the Schizaphis graminum proteins. 2-D electrophoresis provided the protein pI and MW which enabled the refinement of the candidate protein selection and provided a measure of protein abundance when coupled to the spectral data. Thus, the homology-based proteomics pipeline for insects should include efforts to maximize the number of peptide matches to the protein to increase certainty in protein identification and relative protein abundance. "
negative,"DEC: a new miniature inverted-repeat transposable element from the genome of the beetle Tenebrio molitor. In this paper we describe a novel family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), named DEC, isolated from the genome of the beetle Tenebrio molitor. These elements are highly reiterated and their number is estimated to be around 3500 per haploid genome. Two of them have been isolated and the two sequences are 84% identical. Like other MITEs, they are characterized by their small size, their A + T richness, the presence of terminal inverted repeats and the absence of open reading frames. These data suggest that MITEs are probably widely distributed in arthropods. "
positive,"Hydrocarbons catalysed by TmCYP4G122 and TmCYP4G123 in Tenebrio molitor modulate the olfactory response of the parasitoid Scleroderma guani. Hydrocarbons (HCs) present on the epicuticle of terrestrial insects are not only used to reduce water loss but are also used as chemical signals. The cytochrome p450 CYP4G gene is essential for HC biosynthesis in some insects. However, its function in Tenebrio molitor is unknown. Moreover, it is not yet known whether CYP4G of a host can modulate the searching behaviours of its parasitoid. Here, we explore the function of the TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 genes in T. molitor. The TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 transcripts could be detected in all developmental stages. Their expression was higher in the fat body and abdominal cuticle than in the gut. Their transcript levels in mature larvae under desiccation stress [relative humidity (RH) < 5%] was significantly higher than that in the control (RH = 70%). Injection of dsCYP4G122 and dsCYP4G123 caused a reduction in HC biosynthesis and was associated with increased susceptibility to desiccation. Individuals of the parasitoid Scleroderma guani that emerged from mealworm pupae showed host preference for normal pupae whereas S. guani that emerged from pupae lacking CYP4G122 or / and CYP4G123 lost this searching preference. The current results confirm that CYP4G122 and CYP4G123 regulate the biosynthesis of HCs and modulate the olfactory response of its parasitoid S. guani. "
positive,"Native subunit composition of two insect nicotinic receptor subtypes with differing affinities for the insecticide imidacloprid. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively to control a variety of insect pest species. The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), an insect pest of rice crops throughout Asia, is an important target species for control with neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid. Studies with nAChRs purified from N. lugens have identified two [(3)H]imidacloprid binding sites with different affinities (K(d) = 3.5 + / - 0.6 pM and 1.5 + / - 0.2 nM). Co-immunoprecipitation studies with native preparations of N. lugens nAChRs, using subunit-selective antisera, have demonstrated the co-assembly of Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 subunits into one receptor complex and of Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 into another. Immunodepletion of Nlalpha1 or Nlalpha2 subunits resulted in the selective loss of the lower affinity imidacloprid binding site, whereas immunodepletion of Nlalpha3 or Nlalpha8 caused the selective loss of the high-affinity site. Immunodepletion of Nlbeta1 resulted in a complete absence of specific imidacloprid binding. In contrast, immunodepletion with antibodies selective for other N. lugens nAChR subunits (Nlalpha4, Nlalpha6, Nlalpha7 and Nlbeta2) had no significant effect on imidacloprid binding. Taken together, these data suggest that nAChRs containing Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 constitute the lower affinity binding site, whereas nAChRs containing Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 constitute the higher affinity binding site for imidacloprid in N. lugens. "
positive,"An adenylyl cyclase like-9 gene (NlAC9) influences growth and fecundity in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The cAMP / PKA intracellular signaling pathway is launched by adenylyl cyclase (AC) conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent activation of PKA. Although this pathway is very well known in insect physiology, there is little to no information on it in some very small pest insects, such as the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål. BPH is a destructive pest responsible for tremendous crop losses in rice cropping systems. We are investigating the potentials of novel pest management technologies from RNA interference perspective. Based on analysis of transcriptomic data, the BPH AC like-9 gene (NlAC9) was up-regulated in post-mating females, which led us to pose the hypothesis that NlAC9 is a target gene that would lead to reduced BPH fitness and populations. Targeting NlAC9 led to substantially decreased soluble ovarian protein content, yeast-like symbiont abundance, and vitellogenin gene expression, accompanied with stunted ovarian development and body size. Eggs laid were decreased and oviposition period shortened. Taken together, our findings indicated that NlAC9 exerted pronounced effects on female fecundity, growth and longevity, which strongly supports our hypothesis. "
positive,"Large gene family expansions and adaptive evolution for odorant and gustatory receptors in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Gaining insight into the mechanisms of chemoreception in aphids is of primary importance for both integrative studies on the evolution of host plant specialization and applied research in pest control management because aphids rely on their sense of smell and taste to locate and assess their host plants. We made use of the recent genome sequence of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, to address the molecular characterization and evolution of key molecular components of chemoreception: the odorant (Or) and gustatory (Gr) receptor genes. We identified 79 Or and 77 Gr genes in the pea aphid genome and showed that most of them are aphid-specific genes that have undergone recent and rapid expansion in the genome. By addressing selection within sets of paralogous Or and Gr expansions, for the first time in an insect species, we show that the most recently duplicated loci have evolved under positive selection, which might be related to the high degree of ecological specialization of this species. Although more functional studies are still needed for insect chemoreceptors, we provide evidence that Grs and Ors have different sets of positively selected sites, suggesting the possibility that these two gene families might have different binding pockets and bind structurally distinct classes of ligand. The pea aphid is the most basal insect species with a completely sequenced genome to date. The identification of chemoreceptor genes in this species is a key step toward further exploring insect comparative genetics, the genomics of ecological specialization and speciation, and new pest control strategies. "
negative,"Development and evolution of brain allometry in wasps (Vespidae): size, ecology and sociality. We review research on brain development and brain evolution in the wasp family Vespidae. Basic vespid neuroanatomy and some aspects of functional neural circuitry are well-characterized, and genomic tools for exploring brain plasticity are being developed. Although relatively modest in terms of species richness, the Vespidae include species spanning much of the known range of animal social complexity, from solitary nesters to highly eusocial species with some of the largest known colonies and multiple reproductives. Eusocial species differ in behavior and ecology including variation in queen / worker caste differentiation and in diurnal / nocturnal activity. Species differences in overall brain size are strongly associated with brain allometry; relative sizes of visual processing tissues increase at faster rates than antennal processing tissues. The lower relative size of the central-processing mushroom bodies (MB) in eusocial species compared to solitary relatives suggests sociality may relax demands on individual cognitive abilities. However, queens have greater relative MB volumes than their workers, and MB development is positively associated with social dominance status in some species. Fruitful areas for future investigations of adaptive brain investment in the clade include sampling of key overlooked taxa with diverse social structures, and the analysis of neural correlations with ecological divergence in foraging resources and diel activity patterns. "
negative,"Microsatellite loci are not abundant in all arthropod genomes: analyses in the hard tick, Ixodes scapularis and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Plasmid libraries enriched for microsatellites were generated in the tick, Ixodes scapularis and in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Libraries were enriched for genomic DNA containing (AC)n, (AG)n, (ATG)n, (CAG)n, (TAG)n, (AAT)n, (CTGY)n or (GATA)n motifs. Clones containing each motif were sequenced in both species for PCR primer design. In I. scapularis, most primers amplified a single locus and alleles varied in the number of microsatellite repeats and segregated as codominant markers. In contrast (AC)n, (TAG)n and (GATA)n microsatellite loci extracted from Ae. aegypti appeared to be members of multigene families. A primer pair designed to amplify a particular TAG locus instead amplified many independently segregating loci, some of which did not contain TAG microsatellites. Alleles at the TAG loci segregated as dominant markers and there was limited evidence for length variation among alleles. These results suggest that microsatellite loci are not universally abundant in arthropod genomes nor do alleles always segregate as codominant markers. "
positive,"Characterization of two copper / zinc superoxide dismutases (Cu / Zn-SODs) from the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis and their activities in protecting E. coli cells against cold. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are crucial in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, studies regarding SOD functions in insects under cold conditions are rare. In this paper, two novel Cu / Zn-SOD genes in the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis, an extracellular copper / zinc SOD (MpecCu / Zn-SOD) and an intracellular copper / zinc SOD (MpicCu / Zn-SOD), were identified and characterized. The results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that MpecCu / Zn-SOD expression was significantly up-regulated by 4 °C exposure for 0.5 h, but MpicCu / Zn-SOD was not. Superoxide anion radical (O2•-) content in beetles under 4 °C exposure for 0.5 h showed an initial sharp increase and fluctuated during the cold treatment period, which was consistent with the relative mRNA level of MpecCu / Zn-SOD. The total SOD activity in the beetle was negatively correlated to the O2•- content with a correlation coefficient of -0.437. An E. coli system was employed to study the function of each MpCu / Zn-SOD gene. The fusion proteins Trx-His-MpCu / Zn-SODs were over expressed in E. coli BL21 using pET32a vector, and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The transformed bacteria BL21(pET32a-MpecCu / Zn-SOD) and BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD) showed increased cold tolerance to -4 °C as well as increased SOD activity compared to the control BL21(pET32a). The relative conductivity and malondialdehyde content in the two MpCu / Zn-SODs transformed bacteria under -4 °C were significantly lower than the control BL21(pET32a). Furthermore, BL21(pET32a-MpecCu / Zn-SOD) had significantly higher SOD activity and cold tolerance than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD) under -4 °C treatment, and had lower conductivity than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD). In conclusion, low temperature led to the accumulation of O2•- in M. punctipennis, which stimulated the expression of extracellular MpCu / Zn-SOD gene and the increase of total SOD activity. E. coli overexpressing Trx-His-MpCu / Zn-SODs increased resistance to cold treatment-induced oxidative stress. Our findings will be helpful in further study of Cu / Zn-SOD genes in insect cold-tolerance. "
negative,"Genomic innovations, transcriptional plasticity and gene loss underlying the evolution and divergence of two highly polyphagous and invasive Helicoverpa pest species. BACKGROUND: Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea are major caterpillar pests of Old and New World agriculture, respectively. Both, particularly H. armigera, are extremely polyphagous, and H. armigera has developed resistance to many insecticides. Here we use comparative genomics, transcriptomics and resequencing to elucidate the genetic basis for their properties as pests. RESULTS: We find that, prior to their divergence about 1.5 Mya, the H. armigera / H. zea lineage had accumulated up to more than 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra gustatory receptor genes, compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges. The two genomes remain very similar in gene content and order, but H. armigera is more polymorphic overall, and H. zea has lost several detoxification genes, as well as about 50 gustatory receptor genes. It also lacks certain genes and alleles conferring insecticide resistance found in H. armigera. Non-synonymous sites in the expanded gene families above are rapidly diverging, both between paralogues and between orthologues in the two species. Whole genome transcriptomic analyses of H. armigera larvae show widely divergent responses to different host plants, including responses among many of the duplicated detoxification and digestion genes. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme polyphagy of the two heliothines is associated with extensive amplification and neofunctionalisation of genes involved in host finding and use, coupled with versatile transcriptional responses on different hosts. H. armigera's invasion of the Americas in recent years means that hybridisation could generate populations that are both locally adapted and insecticide resistant. "
negative,"Production of human type II collagen using an efficient baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system. Human type II collagen is a macromolecular protein found throughout the human body. The baculovirus expression vector system is one of the most ideal systems for the routine production and display of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in insect, larvae, and mammalian cells. We use this system to express a full-length gene, human type II collagen cDNA (4257 bp), in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells (Sf9), Bombyx mori cells, and silkworm larvae. In this study, the expression of human type II collagen gene in both insect cells and silkworm larvae was purified by nickel column chromatography, leading to 300-kDa bands in SDS-PAGE and western blotting indicative of collagen α-chains organized in a triple-helical structure. About 1 mg / larva human type II collagen is purified from silkworm skin, which shows a putative large scale of collagen production way. An activity assay of recombinant human type II collagen expressed by silkworm larvae demonstrated that the recombinant protein has considerable bioactive properties. Scanning electron microscopy of purified proteins clearly reveals randomly distributed and pitted structures. We conclude that the baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system can be used as an efficient platform for express active human type II collagen and other complicated eukaryotic proteins. "
positive,"WSV181 inhibits JAK / STAT signaling and promotes viral replication in Drosophila. The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway plays a critical role in host defense against viral infections. Here, we report the use of the Drosophila model system to investigate the modulation of the JAK / STAT pathway by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) protein WSV181. WSV181 overexpression in transgenic flies resulted in the downregulation of STAT92E and STAT92E-targeted genes. This result indicates that WSV181 can suppress JAK / STAT signaling by controlling STAT92E expression. An infection experiment was carried out on transgenic Drosophila infected with Drosophila C virus and on Litopenaeus vannamei injected with recombinant WSV181 and WSSV. The increased viral load and suppressed transcript levels of JAK / STAT pathway components indicate that WSV181 can promote viral proliferation by inhibiting the JAK / STAT pathway. This study provided evidence for the role of WSV181 in viral replication and revealed a new mechanism through which WSSV evades host immunity to maintain persistent infection. "
negative,"Genomic imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both mammalian and insect imprinting. Genomic imprinting is a process that marks DNA, causing a change in gene or chromosome behavior, depending on the sex of the transmitting parent. In mammals, most examples of genomic imprinting affect the transcription of individual or small clusters of genes whereas in insects, genomic imprinting tends to silence entire chromosomes. This has been interpreted as evidence of independent evolutionary origins for imprinting. To investigate how these types of imprinting are related, we performed a phenotypic, molecular, and cytological analysis of an imprinted chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of this chromosome reveals that the imprint results in transcriptional silencing. Yet, the domain of transcriptional silencing is very large, extending at least 1.2 Mb and encompassing over 100 genes, and is associated with decreased somatic polytenization of the entire chromosome. We propose that repression of somatic replication in polytenized cells, as a secondary response to the imprint, acts to extend the size of the imprinted domain to an entire chromosome. Thus, imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both typical mammalian and insect imprinting which suggests that genomic imprinting in Drosophila and mammals is not fundamentally different; imprinting is manifest as transcriptional silencing of a few genes or silencing of an entire chromosome depending on secondary processes such as differences in gene density and polytenization. "
negative,"Insect genome content phylogeny and functional annotation of core insect genomes. Twenty-one fully sequenced and well annotated insect genomes were examined for genome content in a phylogenetic context. Gene presence / absence matrices and phylogenetic trees were constructed using several phylogenetic criteria. The role of e-value on phylogenetic analysis and genome content characterization is examined using scaled e-value cutoffs and a single linkage clustering approach to orthology determination. Previous studies have focused on the role of gene loss in terminals in the insect tree of life. The present study examines several common ancestral nodes in the insect tree. We suggest that the common ancestors of major insect groups like Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Holometabola experience more gene gain than gene loss. This suggests that as major insect groups arose, their genomic repertoire expanded through gene duplication (segmental duplications), followed by contraction by gene loss in specific terminal lineages. In addition, we examine the functional significance of the loss and gain of genes in the divergence of some of the major insect groups.  "
negative,"The genome sequence of pepper vein yellows virus (family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus). The complete genome of pepper vein yellows virus (PeVYV) was sequenced using random amplification of RNA samples isolated from vector insects (Aphis gossypii) that had been given access to PeVYV-infected plants. The PeVYV genome consisted of 6244 nucleotides and had a genomic organization characteristic of members of the genus Polerovirus. PeVYV had highest amino acid sequence identities in ORF0 to ORF3 (75.9 - 91.9%) with tobacco vein distorting polerovirus, with which it was only 25.1% identical in ORF5. These sequence comparisons and previously studied biological properties indicate that PeVYV is a distinctly different virus and belongs to a new species of the genus Polerovirus. "
negative,"Biodiversity seen through the perspective of insects: 10 simple rules on methodological choices and experimental design for genomic studies. Massively parallel DNA sequencing opens up opportunities for bridging multiple temporal and spatial dimensions in biodiversity research, thanks to its efficiency to recover millions of nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, we identify the current status, discuss the main challenges, and look into future perspectives on biodiversity genomics focusing on insects, which arguably constitute the most diverse and ecologically important group among all animals. We suggest 10 simple rules that provide a succinct step-by-step guide and best-practices to anyone interested in biodiversity research through the study of insect genomics. To this end, we review relevant literature on biodiversity and evolutionary research in the field of entomology. Our compilation is targeted at researchers and students who may not yet be specialists in entomology or molecular biology. We foresee that the genomic revolution and its application to the study of non-model insect lineages will represent a major leap to our understanding of insect diversity. "
negative,"Towards the genetic control of insect vectors: An overview. Insects are responsible for the transmission of major infectious diseases. Recent advances in insect genomics and transformation technology provide new strategies for the control of insect borne pathogen transmission and insect pest management. One such strategy is the genetic modification of insects with genes that block pathogen development. Another is to suppress insect populations by releasing either sterile males or males carrying female-specific dominant lethal genes into the environment. Although significant progress has been made in the laboratory, further research is needed to extend these approaches to the field. These insect control strategies offer several advantages over conventional insecticide-based strategies. However, the release of genetically modified insects into the environment should proceed with great caution, after ensuring its safety, and acceptance by the target populations. "
