positive,"Identification and functional characterization of an odorant receptor in pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The sensitive olfactory system is necessary for survival of insects. Odorant receptors (ORs) are located on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons and play a critical role in odor detection. Insect ORs are functionally analyzed via heterologous expression in a Xenopus oocyte system using a two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) electrophysiological recording. Here, we have identified a novel OR in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, then we cloned and named it ApisOR4. We analyzed the ApisOR4 tissue expression patterns and found expression only in antennae tissues. Further functional analysis using TEVC revealed that ApisOR4 is broadly tuned to eight volatiles, which elicit electrophysiological response in pea aphid antennae. This study provides an initial functional analysis of aphid ORs and identifies candidate volatiles to be used in developing new strategies for aphid control. "
positive,"Molecular features and expression profiles of octopamine receptors in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: Octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of adrenaline and noradrenaline, regulates and modulates many physiological and behavioral processes in insects. It mediates its effects by binding to specific octopamine receptors, which belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The expression profiles of octopamine receptor genes have been well documented in different developmental stages and multiple tissue types in several different insect orders. However, little work has addressed this issue in Hemiptera. RESULTS: In this study, we cloned four octopamine receptor genes from brown planthopper. The deduced amino acid sequences share high identity with other insect homologues and have the characteristic GPCRs domain architecture: seven transmembrane domains. These genes were expressed in all developmental stages and examined tissues. The expression of NlOA2B3 and NlOA3 was relatively higher in egg and first instar nymph stage than in other stages and other receptor genes. All of these receptor genes were more highly expressed in brain than other tissues. CONCLUSION: The identification of octopamine receptor genes in this study will provide a foundation for investigating the diverse roles played by NlOARs and for exploring specific target sites for chemicals that control agricultural pests. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Insecticide Exposure Triggers a Modulated Expression of ABC Transporter Genes in Larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Insecticides remain a main tool for the control of arthropod vectors. The urgency to prevent the insurgence of insecticide resistance and the perspective to find new target sites, for the development of novel molecules, are fuelling the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in insect defence against xenobiotic compounds. In this study, we have investigated if ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, a major component of the defensome machinery, are involved in defence against the insecticide permethrin, in susceptible larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Bioassays were performed with permethrin alone, or in combination with an ABC transporter inhibitor. Then we have investigated the expression profiles of five ABC transporter genes at different time points following permethrin exposure, to assess their expression patterns across time. The inhibition of ABC transporters increased the larval mortality by about 15-fold. Likewise, three genes were up-regulated after exposure to permethrin, showing different patterns of expression across the 48 h. Our results provide the first evidences of ABC transporters involvement in defence against a toxic in larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and show that the gene expression response is modulated across time, being continuous, but stronger at the earliest and latest times after exposure.

positive,"Host-mediated RNA interference targeting a cuticular protein gene impaired fecundity in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests. This study demonstrated the potential of MyCP dsRNA in developing RNAi-based resistance to M. persicae. RNAi-mediated resistance is expected to be more durable compared with other transgenic strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Molecular cloning and characterization of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β subunit genes from Apis cerana cerana. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast cholinergic synaptic transmission in the insect nervous system and are important targets for insecticides. In this study, we identified and characterized two novel β subunit genes (Accβ1 and Accβ2) from Apis cerana cerana. Homology analysis indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess characteristics that are typical of nAChR subunits although Accβ2 was distinct from Accβ1 and the other nAChR subunits, due to its unusual transmembrane structure and uncommon exon-intron boundary within the genomic region encoding the TM1 transmembrane domain. Analysis of the 5' flanking regions indicated that Accβ1 and Accβ2 possess different regulatory elements, suggesting that the genes might exhibit various expression and regulatory patterns. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Accβ2 was expressed at a much higher level than Accβ1 in the tissues of adult bees. During development, Accβ1 was highly expressed at the pupal stages, whereas Accβ2 was abundantly expressed at the larval stages. Furthermore, Accβ1 and Accβ2 were both induced by exposure to various insecticides and environmental stresses although Accβ2 was more responsive than Accβ1. These results indicate that Accβ1 and Accβ2 may have distinct roles in insect growth and development and that they may belong to separate regulatory pathways involved in the response to insecticides and environmental stresses. This report is the first description of the differences between the nAChR β subunit genes in the Chinese honey bee and establishes an initial foundation for further study. "
negative,"Isolation and genomic characterization of Culex flaviviruses from mosquitoes in Myanmar. An entomological surveillance of arboviruses was conducted in Myanmar in 2014. A total of 8357 Culex mosquito vectors were collected in the Mandalay area and virus isolation was done by using the mosquito cell line C6 / 36 E2. A total of eighteen strains of Culex flavivirus (CxFV) were isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui and Cx. fuscocephala. Like other insect-specific flaviviruses, CxFV can replicate only in mosquito cells but not in mammalian cells. These CxFV strains that were isolated in Japan from mosquitoes collected in Myanmar were closely related to the Wang Thong virus detected from Cx fusocephalus in Thailand and Cx.theileri flavivirus (CTFV) isolated from Cx. theileri mosquitoes in Portugal and Turkey. They encode a single open reading frame with 3357 amino acid residues. They have the characteristics of flaviviruses and have 95.62% amino acid identity with CTFV. This is the first report of CxFV in Myanmar with the characterized viral genome. This study illustrated that CxFV was circulating among the vectors of human pathogenic arboviruses in Myanmar but the impact of CxFV on other flaviviruses which are endemic in the study area still remains to be explored. "
negative,"Gene targeting and transgene stacking using intra genomic homologous recombination in plants. Modern agriculture has created a demand for plant biotechnology products that provide durable resistance to insect pests, tolerance of herbicide applications for weed control, and agronomic traits tailored for specific geographies. These transgenic trait products require a modular and sequential multigene stacking platform that is supported by precise genome engineering technology. Designed nucleases have emerged as potent tools for creating targeted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Exogenously supplied donor DNA can repair the targeted DSB by a process known as gene targeting (GT), resulting in a desired modification of the target genome. The potential of GT technology has not been fully realized for trait deployment in agriculture, mainly because of inefficient transformation and plant regeneration systems in a majority of crop plants and genotypes. This challenge of transgene stacking in plants could be overcome by Intra-Genomic Homologous Recombination (IGHR) that converts independently segregating unlinked donor and target transgenic loci into a genetically linked molecular stack. The method requires stable integration of the donor DNA into the plant genome followed by intra-genomic mobilization. IGHR complements conventional breeding with genetic transformation and designed nucleases to provide a flexible transgene stacking and trait deployment platform.  "
negative,"Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus from the Sudan and Iran: Sequence Comparisons and Identification of a Whitefly-Transmission Determinant. ABSTRACT The genomes of two Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV) isolates, one from the Sudan and one from Iran, were cloned and sequenced. Sequence relationship with other geminiviruses characterizes WmCSV as a typical Eastern Hemisphere geminivirus with a bipartite genome. The two geographically distant WmCSV isolates from Africa and the Middle East share a very high overall sequence similarity: 98% between their DNA-A and 96% between their DNA-B components, and their respective capsid proteins are identical. A single amino acid change in the capsid protein (N131D) renders WmCSV whitefly nontransmissible. This region of the capsid is also implicated in transmission by Bemisia tabaci of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus. "
negative,"RNA interference as a gene silencing tool to control Tuta absoluta in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). RNA interference (RNAi), a gene-silencing mechanism that involves providing double-stranded RNA molecules that match a specific target gene sequence, is now widely used in functional genetic studies. The potential application of RNAi-mediated control of agricultural insect pests has rapidly become evident. The production of transgenic plants expressing dsRNA molecules that target essential insect genes could provide a means of specific gene silencing in larvae that feed on these plants, resulting in larval phenotypes that range from loss of appetite to death. In this report, we show that the tomato leafminer ( Tuta absoluta ), a major threat to commercial tomato production, can be targeted by RNAi. We selected two target genes (Vacuolar ATPase-A and Arginine kinase) based on the RNAi response reported for these genes in other pest species. In view of the lack of an artificial diet for T. absoluta, we used two approaches to deliver dsRNA into tomato leaflets. The first approach was based on the uptake of dsRNA by leaflets and the second was based on ""in planta-induced transient gene silencing"" (PITGS), a well-established method for silencing plant genes, used here for the first time to deliver in planta-transcribed dsRNA to target insect genes. Tuta absoluta larvae that fed on leaves containing dsRNA of the target genes showed an ∼60% reduction in target gene transcript accumulation, an increase in larval mortality and less leaf damage. We then generated transgenic 'Micro-Tom' tomato plants that expressed hairpin sequences for both genes and observed a reduction in foliar damage by T. absoluta in these plants. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of RNAi as an alternative method for controlling this critical tomato pest. "
positive,"Hormonal control and target genes of ftz-f1 expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera: a positive loop linking juvenile hormone, ftz-f1, and vitellogenin. Ftz-f1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. A 20-hydroxyecdysone pulse allows ftz-f1 gene expression, which then regulates the activity of downstream genes involved in major developmental progression events. In honeybees, the expression of genes like vitellogenin (vg), prophenoloxidase and juvenile hormone-esterase during late pharate-adult development is known to be hormonally controlled in both queens and workers by increasing juvenile hormone (JH) titres in the presence of declining levels of ecdysteroids. Since Ftz-f1 is known for mediating intracellular JH signalling, we hypothesized that ftz-f1 could mediate JH action during the pharate-adult development of honeybees, thus controlling the expression of these genes. Here, we show that ftz-f1 has caste-specific transcription profiles during this developmental period, with a peak coinciding with the increase in JH titre, and that its expression is upregulated by JH and downregulated by ecdysteroids. RNAi-mediated knock down of ftz-f1 showed that the expression of genes essential for adult development (e.g. vg and cuticular genes) depends on ftz-f1 expression. Finally, a double-repressor hypothesis-inspired vg gene knock-down experiment suggests the existence of a positive molecular loop between JH, ftz-f1 and vg. "
negative,"Efficient somatic and germline genome engineering of Bactrocera dorsalis by the CRISPR / Cas9 system. BACKGROUND: Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a very destructive insect pest of many fruits and vegetables, is widespread in many Asian countries. To facilitate control of this pest, it is essential to investigate its genetics and gene function using targeted gene disruption. RESULTS: Here, we describe successful targeted mutagenesis of the white and transformer genes in B. dorsalis through use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR / Cas9) system. Co-injection of the white sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA into B. dorsalis embryos caused eye color change, and the white mutations in the germline were heritable. CRISPR-mediated knockout of the sex determination gene transformer (tra) in B. dorsalis resulted in a male-biased sex ratio and adult flies with abnormal outer and interior reproductive organs. Small indels and substitutions were induced by CRIRPR for both genes. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that somatic and germline genome engineering of the pest B. dorsalis can be performed efficiently using the CRISPR / Cas9 system, opening the door to the use of the CRISPR-mediated method for functional annotations of genes in B. dorsalis and for its population control using, for example, such as gene drive. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Analysis of Homologs of Cry-toxin Receptor-Related Proteins in the Midgut of a Non-Bt Target, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens is one of the most destructive insect pests in the rice fields of Asia. Like other hemipteran insects, BPH is not susceptible to Cry toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or transgenic rice carrying Bt cry genes. Lack of Cry receptors in the midgut is one of the main reasons that BPH is not susceptible to the Cry toxins. The main Cry-binding proteins (CBPs) of the susceptible insects are cadherin, aminopeptidase N (APN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In this study, we analyzed and validated de novo assembled transcripts from transcriptome sequencing data of BPH to identify and characterize homologs of cadherin, APN, and ALP. We then compared the cadherin-, APN-, and ALP-like proteins of BPH to previously reported CBPs to identify their homologs in BPH. The sequence analysis revealed that at least one cadherin, one APN, and two ALPs of BPH contained homologous functional domains identified from the Cry-binding cadherin, APN, and ALP, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction used to verify the expression level of each putative Cry receptor homolog in the BPH midgut indicated that the CBPs homologous APN and ALP were expressed at high or medium-high levels while the cadherin was expressed at a low level. These results suggest that homologs of CBPs exist in the midgut of BPH. However, differences in key motifs of CBPs, which are functional in interacting with Cry toxins, may be responsible for insusceptibility of BPH to Cry toxins. "
negative,"Phylogenetic footprinting analysis in the upstream regulatory regions of the Drosophila enhancer of split genes. During Drosophila development Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]-dependent Notch activation upregulates transcription of the Enhancer of split-Complex [E(spl)-C] genes. Drosophila melanogaster E(spl) genes share common transcription regulators including binding sites for Su(H), proneural, and E(spl) basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. However, the expression patterns of E(spl) genes during development suggest that additional factors are involved. To better understand regulators responsible for these expression patterns, recently available sequence and annotation data for multiple Drosophila genomes were used to compare the E(spl) upstream regulatory regions from more than nine Drosophila species. The mgamma and mbeta regulatory regions are the most conserved of the bHLH genes. Fine analysis of Su(H) sites showed that high-affinity Su(H) paired sites and the Su(H) paired site plus proneural site (SPS + A) architecture are completely conserved in a subset of Drosophila E(spl) genes. The SPS + A module is also present in the upstream regulatory regions of the more ancient mosquito and honeybee E(spl) bHLH genes. Additional transcription factor binding sites were identified upstream of the E(spl) genes and compared between species of Drosophila. Conserved sites provide new understandings about E(spl) regulation during development. Conserved novel sequences found upstream of multiple E(spl) genes may play a role in the expression of these genes. "
negative,"Mode of action of nanoparticles against insects. The employment of nanoparticles obtained through various synthesis routes as novel pesticides recently attracted high research attention. An impressive number of studies have been conducted to test their toxic potential against a wide number of arthropod pests and vectors, with major emphasis on mosquitoes and ticks. However, precise information on the mechanisms of action of nanoparticles against insects and mites are limited, with the noteworthy exception of silica, alumina, silver, and graphene oxide nanoparticles on insects, while no information is available for mites. Here, I summarize current knowledge about the mechanisms of action of nanoparticles against insects. Both silver and graphene oxide nanoparticles have a significant impact on insect antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Ag nanoparticles also reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, while polystyrene nanoparticles inhibited CYP450 isoenzymes. Au nanoparticles can act as trypsin inhibitors and disrupt development and reproduction. Metal nanoparticles can bind to S and P in proteins and nucleic acids, respectively, leading to a decrease in membrane permeability, therefore to organelle and enzyme denaturation, followed by cell death. Besides, Ag nanoparticles up- and downregulate key insect genes, reducing protein synthesis and gonadotrophin release, leading to developmental damages and reproductive failure. The toxicity of SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles is due to their binding to the insect cuticle, followed by physico-sorption of waxes and lipids, leading to insect dehydration. In the final section, insect nanotoxicology research trends are critically discussed, outlining major challenges to predict the ecotoxicological consequences arising from the real-world use of nanoparticles as pesticides.

negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Anopheles minimus (Diptera: Culicidae) and the phylogenetics of known Anopheles mitogenomes. Anopheles minimus is an important vector of human malaria in southern China and Southeast Asia. The phylogenetics of mosquitoes has not been well resolved, and the mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) has proven to be an important marker in the study of evolutionary biology. In this study, the complete mtgenome of An. minimus was sequenced for the first time. It is 15 395 bp long and encodes 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and a non-coding region. The gene organization is consistent with those of known Anopheles mtgenomes. The mtgenome performs a clear bias in nucleotide composition with a positive AT-skew and a negative GC-skew. All 13 PCGs prefer to use the codon UUA (Leu), ATN as initiation codon but cytochrome-oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and ND5, with TCG and GTG, and TAA as termination codon, but COI, COII, COIII and ND4, all with the incomplete T. tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, but tRNA(Ser(AGN)) is consistent with known Anopheles mtgenomes. The control region includes a conserved T-stretch and a (TA)n stretch, and has the highest A+T content at 93.1%. The phylogenetics of An. minimus with 18 other Anopheles species was constructed by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, based on concatenated PCG sequences. The subgenera, Cellia and Anopheles, and Nyssorhynchus and Kerteszia have mutually close relationships, respectively. The Punctulatus group and Leucosphyrus group of Neomyzomyia Series, and the Albitarsis group of Albitarsis Series were suggested to be monophyletic. The monophyletic status of the subgenera, Cellia, Anopheles, Nyssorhynchus and Kerteszia need to be further elucidated.  "
negative,"Selective sweep of Wolbachia and parthenogenetic host genomes - the example of the weevil Eusomus ovulum. Most parthenogenetic weevil species are postulated to have originated via hybridization, but Wolbachia has also been speculated to play a role via the induction of parthenogenesis. Here, we examine the molecular diversity of Wolbachia and parthenogenetic host genomes. The host species studied here, Eusomus ovulum, is known to be exclusively parthenogenetic and triploid. The E. ovulum populations that we examined had a low genetic diversity of mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I gene) and nuclear markers (internal transcribed spacer 2 and elongation factor 1-α gene), and they all were infected by only single bacteria strains (genotyped for five genes according to the multilocus sequence typing system). We found significant signs of linkage disequilibrium and a lack of recombination amongst all of the examined genomes (bacteria and host), which strongly indicates a selective sweep. The lack of heterozygosity in host nuclear genes, missing bisexual populations and selective sweep between the parthenogenetic host and bacteria genomes suggest that parthenogenesis in this species could have originated as a result of infection rather than hybridization. However, the finding that highly similar Wolbachia strains are also present in other parthenogenetic weevils from the same habitat suggests the opposite scenario: bacteria may have infected the already parthenogenetic lineage and taken advantage of the host's unisexual reproduction. "
negative,"Genome-wide RIP-Chip analysis of translational repressor-bound mRNAs in the Plasmodium gametocyte. BACKGROUND: Following fertilization, the early proteomes of metazoans are defined by the translation of stored but repressed transcripts; further embryonic development relies on de novo transcription of the zygotic genome. During sexual development of Plasmodium berghei, a rodent model for human malaria species including P. falciparum, the stability of repressed mRNAs requires the translational repressors DOZI and CITH. When these repressors are absent, Plasmodium zygote development and transmission to the mosquito vector is halted, as hundreds of transcripts become destabilized. However, which mRNAs are direct targets of these RNA binding proteins, and thus subject to translational repression, is unknown. RESULTS: We identify the maternal mRNA contribution to post-fertilization development of P. berghei using RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis. We find that 731 mRNAs, approximately 50% of the transcriptome, are associated with DOZI and CITH, allowing zygote development to proceed in the absence of RNA polymerase II transcription. Using GFP-tagging, we validate the repression phenotype of selected genes and identify mRNAs relying on the 5' untranslated region for translational control. Gene deletion reveals a novel protein located in the ookinete crystalloid with an essential function for sporozoite development. CONCLUSIONS: Our study details for the first time the P. berghei maternal repressome. This mRNA population provides the developing ookinete with coding potential for key molecules required for life-cycle progression, and that are likely to be critical for the transmission of the malaria parasite from the rodent and the human host to the mosquito vector. "
negative,"Insect mitochondrial genomics 3: the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of representatives from two neuropteroid orders: a dobsonfly (order Megaloptera) and a giant lacewing and an owlfly (order Neuroptera). We describe the complete mitochondrial genomes from representatives of two orders of the Neuropterida: a dobsonfly, Corydalus cornutus (Megaloptera: Corydalidae, GenBank Accession No. FJ171323), a giant lacewing Polystoechotes punctatus (Neuroptera: Polystoechotidae, FJ171325), and an owlfly, Ascaloptynx appendiculatus (Neuroptera: Ascalaphidae, FJ171324). The dobsonfly sequence is 15,687 base pairs with a major noncoding (A+T rich) region of approximately 967 bp. The gene content and organization of the dobsonfly is identical to that of most insects. The giant lacewing sequence is 16 036 bp with a major noncoding region of about 1123 bp, while the owlfly sequence is 15,877 bp with a major noncoding region of about 1066 bp. The two Neuroptera sequences include a transposition of two tRNA genes, tRNATrp and tRNACys. These tRNA genes are coded on opposite strands and overlap by seven residues in the standard insect mitochondrial gene arrangement. Thus, the transposition required a duplication of at least the region of overlap. It is likely that the transposition occurred by a duplication of both genes followed by deletion of one copy of each gene. Examination of this region in two other neuropteroid species, a snakefly, Agulla sp. (Raphidioptera: Raphidiidae), and an antlion, Myrmeleon immaculatus (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), shows that the rearrangement is widespread in the order Neuroptera but not present in either of the other two orders of Neuropterida. "
negative,"A maturing understanding of the composition of the insect gene repertoire. Recent insect genome sequencing initiatives have dramatically accelerated the accumulation of genomics data resources sampling species from different lineages to explore the incredible diversity of insect biology. These efforts have built a comprehensive catalogue of the insect gene repertoire, which is expanded with each newly-sequenced genome and continually refined using knowledge from cross-species comparisons and new sources of evidence. Since the sequencing of the very first insect genomes, comparative analyses have identified shared (homologous) and equivalent (orthologous) genes, as well as subsets of genes that appear to be unique. With the number of available insect genomes fast approaching one hundred, a maturing understanding of the composition of the insect gene repertoire broadly partitions it into an expected core of universally-present orthologues and a diverse array of lineage-specific and species-specific genes. While homology and orthology help to build evolutionarily-informed functional hypotheses for many genes from these newly-sequenced genomes, experimental interrogations are required to test such hypotheses and to probe the functions of genes for which homology offers no clues. Such taxonomically-restricted genes may represent the current contents of an evolutionary melting pot, out of which novel adaptations have emerged to make insects the most successful group of animals on Earth. "
negative,"A mutation in the PSST homologue of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) from Tetranychus urticae is associated with resistance to METI acaricides. The acaricidal compounds pyridaben, tebufenpyrad and fenpyroximate are frequently used in the control of phytophagous mites such as Tetranychus urticae, and are referred to as Mitochondrial Electron Transport Inhibitors, acting at the quinone binding pocket of complex I (METI-I acaricides). Because of their very frequent use, resistance evolved fast more than 20 years ago, and is currently wide-spread. Increased activity of P450 monooxygenases has been often associated with resistance, but target-site based resistance mechanisms were never reported. Here, we report the discovery of a mutation (H92R) in the PSST homologue of complex I in METI-I resistant T. urticae strains. The position of the mutation was studied using the high-resolution crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus, and was located in a stretch of amino acids previously photo-affinity labeled by fenpyroximate. Selection experiments with a strain segregating for the mutant allele, together with marker-assisted back-crossing of the mutation in a susceptible background, confirmed the involvement of the mutation in METI-I resistance. Additionally, an independent genetic mapping approach; QTL analysis identified the genomic region of pyridaben resistance, which included the PSST gene. Last, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools to introduce the mutation in the Drosophila PSST homologue. "
negative,"Distal-less homeobox genes of insects and spiders: genomic organization, function, regulation and evolution. The Distal-less (Dll) genes are homeodomain transcription factors that are present in most Metazoa and in representatives of all investigated arthropod groups. In Drosophila, the best studied insect, Dll plays an essential role in forming the proximodistal axis of the legs, antennae and analia, and in specifying antennal identity. The initiation of Dll expression in clusters of cells in mid-lateral regions of the Drosophila embryo represents the earliest genetic marker of limbs. Dll genes are involved in the development of the peripheral nervous system and sensitive organs, and they also function as master regulators of black pigmentation in some insect lineages. Here we analyze the complete genomes of six insects, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens, as well as multiple Dll sequences available in databases in order to examine the structure and protein features of these genes. We also review the function, expression, regulation and evolution of arthropod Dll genes with emphasis on insects and spiders.  "
negative,"Gene expression in gut symbiotic organ of stinkbug affected by extracellular bacterial symbiont. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris possesses a specialized symbiotic organ in a posterior region of the midgut, where numerous crypts harbor extracellular betaproteobacterial symbionts of the genus Burkholderia. Second instar nymphs orally acquire the symbiont from the environment, and the symbiont infection benefits the host by facilitating growth and by occasionally conferring insecticide resistance. Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in symbiotic and non-symbiotic regions of the midgut dissected from Burkholderia-infected and uninfected R. pedestris. Expression sequence tag analysis of cDNA libraries and quantitative reverse transcription PCR identified a number of insect genes expressed in symbiosis- or aposymbiosis-associated patterns. For example, genes up-regulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals, including many cysteine-rich secreted protein genes and many cathepsin protease genes, are likely to play a role in regulating the symbiosis. Conversely, genes up-regulated in aposymbiotic relative to symbiotic individuals, including a chicken-type lysozyme gene and a defensin-like protein gene, are possibly involved in regulation of non-symbiotic bacterial infections. Our study presents the first transcriptomic data on gut symbiotic organ of a stinkbug, which provides initial clues to understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the insect-bacterium gut symbiosis and sheds light on several intriguing commonalities between endocellular and extracellular symbiotic associations. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the Orange Hairstreak Japonica lutea (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclinae). The complete mitochondrial genome of Japonica lutea is 15,225 bp in length, containing 37 typical insect genes: 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a non-coding AT-rich region. All the 13 PCGs are initiated with ATN, except for COI gene which is started by CGA. Nine PCGs use the complete termination codon (TAN), whereas the COI, COII, ND4 and ND5 genes end with single nucleotide T. In total, 131 bp intergenic spacers and 31 bp overlapping sequences are interspersed throughout the whole genome. The two rRNA genes (lrRNA and srRNA) are 1327 bp and 770 bp in size, with their AT contents of 87.8% and 85.5%, respectively. All tRNAs display typical secondary cloverleaf structures except for tRNASer(AGN) which loses the DHU arm. The 401 bp long AT-rich region contains several features characteristic of the lepidopterans, such as the ATAGA motif followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, a microsatellite-like (AT)7 element preceded by the ATTTA motif and a 9 bp poly-A stretch.

positive,"Genome-wide analysis of Notch signalling in Drosophila by transgenic RNAi. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens have identified near-complete sets of genes involved in cellular processes. However, this methodology has not yet been used to study complex developmental processes in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report the use of a library of Drosophila strains expressing inducible hairpin RNAi constructs to study the Notch signalling pathway during external sensory organ development. We assigned putative loss-of-function phenotypes to 21.2% of the protein-coding Drosophila genes. Using secondary assays, we identified 6 new genes involved in asymmetric cell division and 23 novel genes regulating the Notch signalling pathway. By integrating our phenotypic results with protein interaction data, we constructed a genome-wide, functionally validated interaction network governing Notch signalling and asymmetric cell division. We used clustering algorithms to identify nuclear import pathways and the COP9 signallosome as Notch regulators. Our results show that complex developmental processes can be analysed on a genome-wide level and provide a unique resource for functional annotation of the Drosophila genome. "
negative,"Comparative analysis of two phenologically divergent populations of the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) by de novo transcriptome sequencing. The pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa is a Mediterranean lepidopteran defoliator that experiences a rapid range expansion towards higher latitudes and altitudes due to the current climate warming. Its phenology - the time of sexual reproduction - is certainly a key trait for the local adaptation of the processionary moth to climatic conditions. Moreover, an exceptional case of allochronic differentiation was discovered ca. 15 years ago in this species. A population with a shifted phenology (the summer population, SP) co-exists near Leiria, Portugal, with a population following the classical cycle (the winter population, WP). The existence of this population is an outstanding opportunity to decipher the genetic bases of phenology. No genomic resources were so far available for T. pityocampa. We developed a high-throughput sequencing approach to build a first reference transcriptome, and to proceed with comparative analyses of the sympatric SP and WP. We pooled RNA extracted from whole individuals of various developmental stages, and performed a transcriptome characterisation for both populations combining Roche 454-FLX and traditional Sanger data. The obtained sequences were clustered into ca. 12,000 transcripts corresponding to 9265 unigenes. The mean transcript coverage was 21.9 reads per bp. Almost 70% of the de novo assembled transcripts displayed significant similarity to previously published proteins and around 50% of the transcripts contained a full-length coding region. Comparative analyses of the population transcriptomes allowed to investigate genes specifically expressed in one of the studied populations only, and to identify the most divergent homologous SP / WP transcripts. The most divergent pairs of transcripts did not correspond to obvious phenology-related candidate genes, and 43% could not be functionally annotated. This study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide resource for the target species T. pityocampa. Many of the assembled genes are orthologs of published Lepidoptera genes, which allows carrying out gene-specific re-sequencing. Data mining has allowed the identification of SNP loci that will be useful for population genomic approaches and genome-wide scans of population differentiation to identify signatures of selection.

negative,"Insect and plant-derived miRNAs in greenbug (Schizaphis graminum) and yellow sugarcane aphid (Sipha flava) revealed by deep sequencing. Schizaphis graminum (green bug; GB) and Sipha flava (yellow sugarcane aphid; YSA) are two cereal aphid species with broad host ranges capable of establishing on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and several switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) cultivars. Switchgrass and sorghum are staple renewable bioenergy crops that are vulnerable to damage by aphids, therefore, identifying novel targets to control aphids has the potential to drastically improve yields and reduce losses in these bioenergy crops. Despite the wealth of genomic and transcriptomic information available from a closely related model aphid species, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), similar genomic information, including the identification of small RNAs, is still limited for GB and YSA. Deep sequencing of miRNAs expressed in GB and YSA was conducted and 72 and 56 miRNA candidates (including 14 and eight novel) were identified, respectively. Of the identified miRNAs, 45 were commonly expressed in both aphid species. Further, plant derived miRNAs were also detected in both aphid samples, including 13 (eight known and five novel) sorghum miRNAs and three (novel) barley miRNAs. In addition, potential aphid gene targets for the host plant-derived miRNAs were predicted. The establishment of miRNA repertoires in these two aphid species and the detection of plant-derived miRNA in aphids will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression networks in these two aphids and the potential roles of plant miRNAs in mediating plant-insect interactions.

negative,"Discovery and initial analysis of novel viral genomes in the soybean cyst nematode. Nematodes are the most abundant multicellular animals on earth, yet little is known about their natural viral pathogens. To date, only two nematode virus genomes have been reported. Consequently, nematode viruses have been overlooked as important biotic factors in the study of nematode ecology. Here, we show that one plant parasitic nematode species, Heterodera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), harbours four different RNA viruses. The nematode virus genomes were discovered in the SCN transcriptome after high-throughput sequencing and assembly. All four viruses have negative-sense RNA genomes, and are distantly related to nyaviruses and bornaviruses, rhabdoviruses, bunyaviruses and tenuiviruses. Some members of these families replicate in and are vectored by insects, and can cause significant diseases in animals and plants. The novel viral sequences were detected in both eggs and the second juvenile stage of SCN, suggesting that these viruses are transmitted vertically. While there was no evidence of integration of viral sequences into the nematode genome, we indeed detected transcripts from these viruses by using quantitative PCR. These data are the first finding of virus genomes in parasitic nematodes. This discovery highlights the need for further exploration for nematode viruses in all tropic groups of these diverse and abundant animals, to determine how the presence of these viruses affects the fitness of the nematode, strategies of viral transmission and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. "
positive,"Olfactory co-receptor Orco stimulated by Rice stripe virus is essential for host seeking behavior in small brown planthopper. BACKGROUND: Laodelphax striatellus, the small brown planthopper (SBPH), is an economically important pest, besides sucking damage, which transmits rice viruses to cause severe damages to rice. In the process of virus transmission, the host orientation behavior of insect is mainly driven by olfaction. In this context, the molecular basis of olfaction in SBPH is of particular interest. RESULTS: Here, we identified the gene that encodes olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) and analyzed its expression profiles in Rice stripe virus (RSV)-infected and RSV-free SBPH. It was found that LstrOrco shared high identity with other Orcos from different order insects. LstrOrco was mainly expressed in the head of SBPH, and its expression was significantly stimulated by RSV-infection. The behavioral bioassay revealed that viruliferous SBPH might have a stronger olfactory and seeking ability for rice than RSV-free insect. After silencing of LstrOrco expression, the olfaction and seeking behavior of nymphs for rice seedlings was significantly inhibited, mainly in the increase of the 'no response' percent and the prolongation of the response time. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that Orco played an important role in olfactory signaling and seeking behavior of SBPH, which provided a basic for future development of olfactory-based agriculture pest management strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Extensive gene amplification and concerted evolution within the CPR family of cuticular proteins in mosquitoes. Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae genome has revealed a large increase in the number of genes encoding cuticular proteins with the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus (the CPR gene family) relative to Drosophila melanogaster. This increase reflects an expansion of the RR-2 group of CPR genes, particularly the amplification of sets of highly similar paralogs. Patterns of nucleotide variation indicate that extensive concerted evolution is occurring within these clusters. The pattern of concerted evolution is complex, however, as sequence similarity within clusters is uncorrelated with gene order and orientation, and no comparable clusters occur within similarly compact arrays of the RR-1 group in mosquitoes or in either group in D. melanogaster. The dearth of pseudogenes suggests that sequence clusters are maintained by selection for high gene-copy number, perhaps due to selection for high expression rates. This hypothesis is consistent with the apparently parallel evolution of compact gene architectures within sequence clusters relative to single-copy genes. We show that RR-2 proteins from sequence-cluster genes have complex repeats and extreme amino-acid compositions relative to single-copy CPR proteins in An. gambiae, and that the amino-acid composition of the N-terminal and C-terminal sequence flanking the chitin-binding consensus region evolves in a correlated fashion. "
negative,"Disruptions of the genes involved in lysine biosynthesis, iron acquisition, and secondary metabolisms affect virulence and fitness in Metarhizium robertsii. Based on genomic analysis, polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) pathways account for biosynthesis of the majority of the secondary metabolites produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii. To evaluate the contribution of these pathways to M. robertsii fitness and / or virulence, mutants deleted for mrpptA, the Sfp-type 4' phosphopantetheinyl transferase gene required for their activation were generated. ΔmrpptA strains were deficient in PKS and NRPS activity resulting in colonies that lacked the typical green pigment and failed to produce the nonribosomal peptides (destruxins, serinocylins, and the siderophores ferricrocin and metachelins) as well as the hybrid polyketide-peptides (NG-39x) that are all produced by the wild type (WT) M. robertsii. The ΔmrpptA colonies were also auxotrophic for lysine. Two other mutant strains were generated: ΔmraarA, in which the α-aminoadipate reductase gene critical for lysine biosynthesis was disrupted, and ΔmrsidA, in which the L-ornithine N5-oxygenase gene that is critical for hydroxamate siderophore biosynthesis was disrupted. The phenotypes of these mutants were compared to those of ΔmrpptA to separate effects of the loss of lysine or siderophore production from the overall effect of losing all polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide production. Loss of lysine biosynthesis marginally increased resistance to H2O2 while it had little effect on the sensitivity to the cell wall disruptor sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and no effect on sensitivity to iron deprivation. In contrast, combined loss of metachelin and ferricrocin through the inactivation of mrsidA resulted in mutants that were as hypersensitive or slightly more sensitive to H2O2, iron deprivation, and SDS, and were either identical or marginally higher in ΔmrpptA strains. In contrast to ΔmrpptA, loss of mrsidA did not completely abolish siderophore activity, which suggests the production of one or more non-hydroxamate iron-chelating compounds. Deletion of mrpptA, mrsidA, and mraarA reduced conidium production and conidia of a GFP-tagged ΔmrpptA strain displayed a longer germination delay than WT on insect cuticles, a deficiency that was rescued by lysine supplementation. Compared with WT, ΔmrpptA strains displayed ∼19-fold reduction in virulence against Drosophila suzukii. In contrast, lysine auxotrophy and loss of siderophores accounted for ∼2 and ∼6-fold decreases in virulence, respectively. Deletion of mrpptA had no significant effect on growth inhibition of Bacillus cereus. Our results suggest that PKS and NRPS metabolism plays a significant role in M. robertsii virulence, depresses conidium production, and contributes marginally to resistance to oxidative stress and iron homeostasis, but has no significant antibacterial effect. "
positive,"Silencing a sugar transporter gene reduces growth and fecundity in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, sugar transporter gene 6 (Nlst6) is a facilitative glucose / fructose transporter (often called a passive carrier) expressed in midgut that mediates sugar transport from the midgut lumen to hemolymph. The influence of down regulating expression of sugar transporter genes on insect growth, development, and fecundity is unknown. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suspect that transporter-mediated uptake of dietary sugar is essential to the biology of phloem-feeding insects. Based on this reasoning, we posed the hypothesis that silencing, or reducing expression, of a BPH sugar transporter gene would be deleterious to the insects. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of Nlst6 knockdown on BPH biology. Reducing expression of Nlst6 led to profound effects on BPHs. It significantly prolonged the pre-oviposition period, shortened the oviposition period, decreased the number of eggs deposited and reduced body weight, compared to controls. Nlst6 knockdown also significantly decreased fat body and ovarian (particularly vitellogenin) protein content as well as vitellogenin gene expression. Experimental BPHs accumulated less fat body glucose compared to controls. We infer that Nlst6 acts in BPH growth and fecundity, and has potential as a novel target gene for control of phloem-feeding pest insects.  "
negative,"Volatile signaling in plant-plant interactions: ""talking trees"" in the genomics era. Plants may ""eavesdrop"" on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by herbivore-attacked neighbors to activate defenses before being attacked themselves. Transcriptome and signal cascade analyses of VOC-exposed plants suggest that plants eavesdrop to prime direct and indirect defenses and to hone competitive abilities. Advances in research on VOC biosynthesis and perception have facilitated the production of plants that are genetically ""deaf"" to particular VOCs or ""mute"" in elements of their volatile vocabulary. Such plants, together with advances in VOC analytical instrumentation, will allow researchers to determine whether fluency enhances the fitness of plants in natural communities. "
negative,"A draft genome assembly of the army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda. Spodoptera is an agriculturally important pest insect and studies in understanding its biology have been limited by the unavailability of its genome. In the present study, the genomic DNA was sequenced and assembled into 37,243 scaffolds of size, 358 Mb with N50 of 53.7 kb. Based on degree of identity, we could anchor 305 Mb of the genome onto all the 28 chromosomes of Bombyx mori. Repeat elements were identified, which accounts for 20.28% of the total genome. Further, we predicted 11,595 genes, with an average intron length of 726 bp. The genes were annotated and domain analysis revealed that Sf genes share a significant homology and expression pattern with B. mori, despite differences in KOG gene categories and representation of certain protein families. The present study on Sf genome would help in the characterization of cellular pathways to understand its biology and comparative evolutionary studies among lepidopteran family members to help annotate their genomes. "
negative,"The chromosomes of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae): detailed photographic polytene chromosomal maps and in situ hybridization data. The spotted wing drosophila, D. suzukii, is a serious agricultural pest attacking a variety of soft fruits and vegetables. Although originating from East Asia it has recently invaded America and Europe raising major concern about its expansion potential and the consequent economic losses. Since cytogenetic information on the species is scarce, we report here the mitotic karyotype and detailed photographic maps of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of D. suzukii. The mitotic metaphase complement contains three pairs of autosomes, one of which is dot-like, and one pair of heteromorphic (XX / XY) sex chromosomes. The salivary gland polytene complement consists of five long polytene arms, representing the two metacentric autosomes and the acrocentric X chromosome, and one very short polytene element, which corresponds to the dot-like autosome. Banding pattern as well as the most characteristic features and prominent landmarks of each polytene chromosome arm are presented and discussed. Furthermore, twelve gene markers have been mapped on the polytene chromosomes of D. suzukii by in situ hybridization. Their distribution pattern was found quite similar to that of D. melanogaster revealing conservation of synteny although the relative position within each chromosome arm for most of the genes differed significantly between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster. The chromosome information presented here is suitable for comparative cytogenetic studies and phylogenetic exploration, while it could also facilitate the assembly of the genome sequence and support the development of genetic tools for species-specific and environment-friendly biological control applications such as the sterile insect technique. "
negative,"An insect trypsin-like serine protease as a target of microRNA: utilization of microRNA mimics and inhibitors by oral feeding. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs (18-25 nt) that play crucial roles in various biological processes, including development, as gene regulators. In this study, we identified a miRNA, har-miR-2002b, that is specifically expressed during larval stages of Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm). For the first time, we explored the possibility of utilizing synthetic inhibitor and mimic of a miRNA by oral feeding and confirmed that the inhibitor and mimic can successfully inhibit / oversupply har-miR-2002b in H. armigera larvae. Bioassays by oral feeding indicated 70% reduction in fecundity and 40% larval mortality in the presence of har-miR-2002b mimic. In addition, a large proportion of those larvae that made it to the pupal stage were deformed and only few moths emerged from them. This implied an important role of har-miR-2002b in larval development and adult fecundity. A trypsin-like serine protease (Ha-TLP) was identified as a target of har-miR-2002b. In vivo and in vitro studies revealed that in the presence of the miRNA mimic Ha-TLP transcript / protein levels and enzyme activity were significantly reduced. In contrast, inhibition of har-miR-2002b led to significant up-regulation of Ha-TLP transcript levels. This is the first study which shows the potential of utilization of miRNA mimics and inhibitors in pest control by targeting specific insect genes. "
negative,"Species-specific expansion of C2H2 zinc-finger genes and their expression profiles in silkworm, Bombyx mori. Most C2H2 zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) function as sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, and play important roles in a variety of biology processes, such as development, differentiation, and tumor suppression. By searching the silkworm genome with a HMM model of C2H2 zinc-fingers, we have identified a total of 338 C2H2 ZFPs. Most of the ZFP genes were clustered on chromosomes and showed uneven distribution in the genome. Over one third of genes were concentrated on chromosome 11, 15 and 24. Phylogenetic analysis classified all silkworm C2H2 ZFPs into 75 families; 63 of which belong to evolutionarily conserved families. In addition, 188 C2H2 ZFP genes (55.6%) are species-specific to the silkworm. A species-specific expansion of a family with 39 members in a tandem array on chromosome 24 may explain the higher number of species-specific ZFPs in silkworm compared to other organisms. The expression patterns of C2H2 ZFP genes were also examined by microarray analysis. Most of these genes were actively expressed among different tissues on day 3 of the fifth instar. The results provide insight into the biological functions of the silkworm C2H2 ZFP genes in metamorphism and development. "
negative,"A case for sequencing the genome of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae). House flies are carriers of >100 devastating diseases that have severe consequences for human and animal health. Despite the fact that it is a passive vector, a key bottleneck to progress in controlling the human diseases transmitted by house flies is lack of knowledge of the basic molecular biology of this species. Sequencing of the house fly genome will provide important inroads to the discovery of novel target sites for house fly control, understanding of the house fly immune response, rapid elucidation of insecticide resistance genes, and understanding of numerous aspects of the basic biology of this insect pest. The ability of the house fly to prosper in a remarkably septic environment motivates analysis of its innate immune system. Its polymorphic sex determination system, with male-determining factors on either the autosomes or the Y chromosome, is ripe for a genomic analysis. Sequencing of the house fly genome would allow the first opportunity to study the interactions between a pest insect and its parasitoid (Nasonia vitripennis) at the whole genome level. In addition, the house fly is well placed phylogenetically to leverage analysis of the multiple Dipteran genomes that have been sequenced (including several mosquito and Drosophila species). The community of researchers investigating Musca domestica are well prepared and highly motivated to apply genomic analyses to their widely varied research programs. "
negative,"A new versatile gene-trap vector for insect transgenics. A new piggyBac-based gene-trap vector, pB-GT1, was constructed. pB-GT1 contains three marker genes, dsRed, Gal4, and EGFP. dsRed is under the control of the constitutive 3xP3 promoter, which induces dsRed expression wherever the vector is inserted in the host genome. The Gal4 sequence has no promoter but is preceded by the splice acceptor site so that it can be transcribed as a transcript fused with the host exon 5' to the insertion site. EGFP is driven by the constitutive ie+hr promoter but lacks a poly(A)(+) signal sequence, and thus the EGFP expression is detectable only when its transcript is fused with the host exon 3' downstream of the insertion. By the microinjection of the vector into fertilized eggs, we obtained transgenic Drosophila with a single copy of pB-GT1, which was inserted into the first intron of the ovo gene. The female flies of this transgenic line are sterile, indicating that the insertion inactivated the ovo gene, generating a new allele of this locus, ovo(pB-GT1). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that an ovo-Gal4-fusion transcript is produced in ovo(pB-GT1) flies. The fact that UAS-EGFP reporter expression was detected in ovo(pB-GT1) germ cells in a pattern similar to that reported for wild-type ovo indicates that functional Gal4 is expressed via pB-GT1, recapitulating the endogenous expression pattern of the trapped gene. pB-GT1 is thus useful in insect genomics for the efficient assignment of functions of individual genes. "
positive,"Carboxylesterase genes in pyrethroid resistant house flies, Musca domestica. Carboxylesterases are one of the major enzyme families involved in the detoxification of pyrethroids. Up-regulation of carboxylesterase genes is thought to be a major component of insecticide resistant mechanisms in insects. Based on the house fly transcriptome and genome database, a total of 39 carboxylesterase genes of different functional clades have been identified in house flies. In this study, eleven of these genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in the resistant ALHF house fly strain compared with susceptible aabys and wild-type CS strains. Eight up-regulated carboxylesterase genes with their expression levels were further induced to a higher level in response to permethrin treatments, indicating that constitutive and inductive overexpression of carboxylesterases are co-responsible for the enhanced detoxification of insecticides. Spatial expression studies revealed these up-regulated genes to be abundantly distributed in fat bodies and genetically mapped on autosome 2 or 3 of house flies, and their expression could be regulated by factors on autosome 1, 2 and 5. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multiple carboxylesterase genes are co-upregulated in resistant house flies, providing further evidence for their involvement in the detoxification of insecticides and development of insecticide resistance. "
positive,"Molecular characterization of an NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase from Bemisia tabaci Q: Potential involvement in susceptibility to imidacloprid. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is an integral component of cytochrome P450-mediated biological reactions, such as the metabolism of xenobiotics, including insecticides. CPR has been reported to be associated with insecticide tolerance in several insects. However, the biochemical characteristics and biological function of CPR in Bemisia tabaci Q (BtCPR) remain undefined. In this study, BtCPR was cloned, and bioinformatic analysis showed that BtCPR is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight (MW) of 76.73 kDa and contains conserved binding domains (FMN, FAD, and NADPH). Tissue- and developmental stage-dependent expression indicated that the highest expression levels of BtCPR occurred in head tissue and in male adults. Transcripts of BtCPR in the field B. tabaci Q strain were 1.62-fold higher than those of the laboratory B. tabaci Q strain. In both field and laboratory adults, the susceptibility of BtCPR-knockdown B. tabaci Q to imidacloprid substantially increased compared to that of the B. tabaci Q control group. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of BtCPR in Sf9 cells exhibited catalytic activity for cytochrome c reduction, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Sf9 cells overexpressing BtCPR had greater viability than the control cells when treated with imidacloprid. The results suggest that BtCPR could affect the susceptibility of B. tabaci Q to imidacloprid and could also be considered a novel target for pest control. "
negative,"Evaluation of DNA barcoding and identification of new haplomorphs in Canadian deerflies and horseflies. This paper reports the first tests of the suitability of the standardized mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding system for the identification of Canadian deerflies and horseflies. Two additional mitochondrial molecular markers were used to determine whether unambiguous species recognition in tabanids can be achieved. Our 332 Canadian tabanid samples yielded 650 sequences from five genera and 42 species. Standard COI barcodes demonstrated a strong A + T bias (mean 68.1%), especially at third codon positions (mean 93.0%). Our preliminary test of this system showed that the standard COI barcode worked well for Canadian Tabanidae: the target DNA can be easily recovered from small amounts of insect tissue and aligned for all tabanid taxa. Each tabanid species possessed distinctive sets of COI haplotypes which discriminated well among species. Average conspecific Kimura two-parameter (K2P) divergence (0.49%) was 12 times lower than the average divergence within species. Both the neighbour-joining and the Bayesian methods produced trees with identical monophyletic species groups. Two species, Chrysops dawsoni Philip and Chrysops montanus Osten Sacken (Diptera: Tabanidae), showed relatively deep intraspecific sequence divergences (∼ 10 times the average) for all three mitochondrial gene regions analysed. We suggest provisional differentiation of Ch. montanus into two haplotypes, namely, Ch. montanus haplomorph 1 and Ch. montanus haplomorph 2, both defined by their molecular sequences and by newly discovered differences in structural features near their ocelli. "
negative,"A large-scale gene discovery for the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The red palm weevil (RPW; Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) is a devastating pest of palms, prevalent in the Middle East as well as many other regions of the world. Here, we report a large-scale de novo complementary DNA (cDNA) sequencing effort that acquired ∼5 million reads and assembled them into 26 765 contigs from 12 libraries made from samples of different RPW developmental stages based on the Roche / 454 GS FLX platform. We annotated these contigs based on the publically available known insect genes and the Tribolium castaneum genome assembly. We find that over 80% of coding sequences (CDS) from the RPW contigs have high-identity homologs to known proteins with complete CDS. Gene expression analysis shows that the pupa and larval stages have the highest and lowest expression levels, respectively. In addition, we also identified more than 60 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 1 200 simple sequence repeat markers. This study provides the first large-scale cDNA dataset for RPW, a much-needed resource for future molecular studies.  "
negative,"Molecular evidence for similarity between Anopheles hyrcanus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Anopheles pseudopictus (Diptera: Culicidae), sympatric potential vectors of malaria in France. Malaria was a former public health problem in the Camargue, southeastern France, where members of the Hyrcanus group were recently described as the main malaria potential vectors. However, the systematic status in this group, which includes at least two sympatric sibling species, Anopheles hyrcanus (Pallas) and Anopheles pseudopictus Grassi as well as a morphologically intermediate form in the Camargue, is unclear. Indeed, both species have been alternatively considered as separated or synonymous species. We examined sequence variation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 and domain-3 (D3) of 28S ribosomal DNA and the cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II (COI and COII) genes of mitochondrial DNA of the Hyrcanus group mosquitoes from the Camargue and Turkey to infer the taxonomic status of the members of this group. DNA sequence analysis of ITS2 and D3 showed no difference between either species or geographical origin (mean pairwise genetic distances d = 0.000-0.003). The COI and COII sequences between French specimens also were nearly identical (d = 0.001-0.002), whereas French and Turkish Anopheles were genetically distinct (d = 0.009-0.014). The distinction between populations of the two areas, supported, respectively, by four and five fixed mutations, attested the differentiation by the distance. Finally, the high degree of genetic similarity, despite morphological differences between An. hyrcanus, An. pseudopictus, and an intermediate form, suggests that these three taxa may belong to a single species in the Camargue. "
negative,"Genomic organization and developmental pattern of expression of the engrailed gene from the brine shrimp Artemia. We report the isolation and characterization of an engrailed gene in the crustacean Artemia franciscana. The Artemia gene spans a genomic region of 15 kilobases and the coding sequence is interrupted by two introns. It appears to be the only gene of the engrailed family present in the Artemia genome. The predicted engrailed-like protein is 349 amino acids long and contains several domains including the homeodomain, well conserved when compared to other proteins of the engrailed family. Based on sequence comparisons we have detected, in the Artemia engrailed protein, several features which are in common with the Drosophila and Bombyx engrailed proteins. It also has some features specific for invected proteins. Therefore, this gene appears to have diverged from an ancestral gene common to both the engrailed and invected insect genes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments show that the expression of this gene in postembryonic development of Artemia is restricted to the posterior part of at least the thoracic and maxillary segments. The pattern is generated sequentially from a growth zone organized in columns of cells close to the caudal region of the larvae. Cell proliferation in the growth zone follows an interspersed pattern without evidence of early lineage restrictions. The engrailed expression is detected in the growth zone before any segmentation is visible and continues to be expressed in a posterior location in the segments that are morphologically defined. Initially expressed in isolated cells, it spreads into rows broadening to two-three cells as segments mature. The evidence presented here is compatible with the hypothesis that intercellular signaling mechanisms are in part responsible of the early activation of selector genes. "
positive,"Identification and Expression Profiling of Odorant Receptor Protein Genes in Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) Using RT-qPCR. This study aimed to identify ORs (odorant receptors) and Orco (odorant receptor coreceptor) genes in Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea), to explore the relative expression levels of these genes in different adult tissues and obtain information on highly expressed receptor proteins. Putative OR and Orco genes were identified from transcriptomic data previously obtained for S. zeamais using bioinformatics methods. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to compare the differences in expression in seven adult tissues (male antennae, female antennae, heads, thoraxes, abdomens, wings, and legs). The candidate OR and Orco gene sequences were analyzed, and the protein physicochemical properties were predicted. We identified 64 OR genes including the Orco gene. Forty-seven OR genes, including Orco, were over expressed in male or female antennae. Seventeen OR genes appeared to be expressed at elevated levels in male antennae. Twenty-nine genes were expressed at significantly elevated levels in female antennae. In total, 11 OR genes were selected for further sequence analysis. The selected proteins were structurally characterized, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Overall, in this study, candidate ORs of S. zeamais have been identified for the first time, and these ORs could be molecular targets for interference in the insect olfactory system. "
negative,"Dosage analysis of Z chromosome genes using microarray in silkworm, Bombyx mori. In many organisms, dosage compensation is needed to equalize sex-chromosome gene expression in males and females. Several genes on silkworm Z chromosome were previously detected to show a higher expression level in males and lacked dosage compensation. Whether silkworm lacks global dosage compensation still remains poorly known. Here, we analyzed male:female (M:F) ratios of expression of chromosome-wide Z-linked genes in the silkworm using microarray data. The expression levels of genes on Z chromosome in each tissue were significantly higher in males compared to females, which indicates no global dosage compensation in silkworm. Interestingly, we also found some genes with no bias (M:F ratio: 0.8-1.2) on the Z chromosome. Comparison of male-biased (M:F ratio more than 1.5) and unbiased genes indicated that the two sets of the genes have functional differences. Analysis of gene expression by sex showed that M:F ratios were, to some extent, associated with their expression levels. These results provide useful clues to further understanding roles of dosage of Z chromosome and some Z-linked sexual differences in silkworms. "
negative,"Chemosensory proteins in the honey bee: Insights from the annotated genome, comparative analyses and expressional profiling. Small chemosensory proteins (CSPs) belong to a conserved, but poorly understood protein family that has been implicated in transporting chemical stimuli within insect sensilla. However, their expression patterns suggest that these molecules are also critical for other functions including early development. Here we used both bioinformatics and experimental approaches to characterize the CSP gene family in a social insect, the Western honey bee Apis mellifera, and then compared its members to CSPs in other arthropods. The number of CSPs in the honey bee genome (six) is similar to that found in the sequenced dipteran species (four-seven), but is much lower than the number of CSPs in the moth or in the beetle (around 20 each). These differences seem to be the result of lineage specific expansions. Our analysis of CSPs in a number of arthropods reveals a conserved gene family found in both Mandibulates and Chelicerates. Expressional profiling in diverse tissues and throughout development reveals broader than expected patterns of expression with none of the CSPs restricted to the antennae and one found only in the queen ovaries and in embryos. We conclude that CSPs are multifunctional context-dependent proteins involved in diverse cellular processes ranging from embryonic development to chemosensory signal transduction. Some CSPs may function in cuticle synthesis, consistent with their evolutionary origins in the arthropods. "
positive,"Functional analysis of saxophone, the Drosophila gene encoding the BMP type I receptor ortholog of human ALK1 / ACVRL1 and ACVR1 / ALK2. In metazoans, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) direct a myriad of developmental and adult homeostatic events through their heterotetrameric type I and type II receptor complexes. We examined 3 existing and 12 newly generated mutations in the Drosophila type I receptor gene, saxophone (sax), the ortholog of the human Activin Receptor-Like Kinase1 and -2 (ALK1 / ACVRL1 and ALK2 / ACVR1) genes. Our genetic analyses identified two distinct classes of sax alleles. The first class consists of homozygous viable gain-of-function (GOF) alleles that exhibit (1) synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in BMP pathway components, and (2) significant maternal effect lethality that can be rescued by an increased dosage of the BMP encoding gene, dpp+. In contrast, the second class consists of alleles that are recessive lethal and do not exhibit lethality in combination with mutations in other BMP pathway components. The alleles in this second class are clearly loss-of-function (LOF) with both complete and partial loss-of-function mutations represented. We find that one allele in the second class of recessive lethals exhibits dominant-negative behavior, albeit distinct from the GOF activity of the first class of viable alleles. On the basis of the fact that the first class of viable alleles can be reverted to lethality and on our ability to independently generate recessive lethal sax mutations, our analysis demonstrates that sax is an essential gene. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that a normal sax transcript is produced by saxP, a viable allele previously reported to be null, and that this allele can be reverted to lethality. Interestingly, we determine that two mutations in the first class of sax alleles show the same amino acid substitutions as mutations in the human receptors ALK1 / ACVRl-1 and ACVR1 / ALK2, responsible for cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), respectively. Finally, the data presented here identify different functional requirements for the Sax receptor, support the proposal that Sax participates in a heteromeric receptor complex, and provide a mechanistic framework for future investigations into disease states that arise from defects in BMP / TGF-beta signaling.

negative,"The complete mitogenome sequences of the palaeopteran insects Ephemera orientalis (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae) and Davidius lunatus (Odonata: Gomphidae). Currently, the palaeopteran lineages (insect orders Ephemeroptera and Odonata) that have a problematic relationship with neopteran lineages are poorly represented by mitogenome sequences. In this study, we have determined the complete mitogenome of the oriental mayfly, Ephemera orientalis (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae), and the dragonfly Davidius lunatus (Odonata: Gomphidae). The 16 463 bp mitogenome of E. orientalis and the 15 912 bp mitogenome of D. lunatus have many of the features typically detected in insect mitogenomes. Although the initiation codon for the D. lunatus COI gene is the typical ATA, E. orientalis is unusual in that no typical start codon was detected in the start region of the COI gene. The A+T-rich regions of both mitogenomes have some unusual features. The E. orientalis A+T-rich region harbors two identical 55 bp sequences separated by 158 bp, and the D. lunatus A+T-rich region harbors a tandem repeat comprising two identical 261 bp copies and one partial copy of the repeat. Additionally, the A+T-rich regions of both mitogenomes harbor the stem-and-loop structures flanked by the conserved sequences ""TA(A)TA"" at the 5' end and ""G(A)nT"" at the 3' end, which have been suggested to be the signals involved in minor strand replication initiation. Furthermore, the D. lunatus A+T-rich region contains two tRNA-like structures with proper anticodon and cloverleaf structures. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex: Tettigoniidae: Orthoptera) and an analysis of control region variability. The Anabrus simplex is a swarming plague orthopteran found in western North America. The genome is 15 766 bp in length and genome organization follows the ancestral insect gene arrangement. atp6 lacked any readily identifiable stop codon. Examination of mRNA secondary structure for this gene suggested a stem / loop-mediated mRNA post-transcriptional processing to liberate a mature atp6 mRNA with a complete stop codon produced by polyadenylation. Comparison of similar protein with protein gene boundaries in other insect species reveal a general mechanism for mRNA excision and provide further supporting evidence for post-transcriptional mRNA processing in mitochondrial genomes. The A + T-rich region, or control region, was sequenced for 55 A. simplex individuals from 12 different populations. Variance studies between these individuals show that the A + T-rich region contains significant phylogenetic signal to be used in population studies. "
positive,"MiR-219 represses expression of dFMR1 in Drosophila melanogaster. AIMS: Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a vital role in mRNA trafficking and translation inhibition to regulate the synthesis of local proteins in neuronal axons and dendritic terminals. However, there are no reports on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of FMRP levels in Drosophila. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs regulating FMRP levels in Drosophila. MAIN METHODS: Using online software, we predicted and selected 11 miRNAs potentially acting on the Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dFMR1) transcript. These candidates were screened for modulation of dFMR1 transcript levels at the cellular level using a dual luciferase reporter system. In addition, we constructed a transgenic Drosophila model overexpressing miR-219 in the nervous system and quantified dFMRP by western blotting. The neuromuscular junction phenotype in the model was studied by immunofluorescence staining. KEY FINDINGS: Among the 11 miRNAs screened, miR-219 and miR-960 reduced luciferase gene activity by binding to the 3'-UTR of the dFMR1 transcript. Mutation of the miR-219 or miR-960 binding sites on the transcript resulted in complete or partial elimination of the miRNA-induced repression. Western blots revealed that dFMRP expression was decreased in the miR-219 overexpression model (Elav>miR-219). Drosophila larvae overexpressing miR-219 showed morphological abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (increased synaptic boutons and synaptic branches). This finding is consistent with some phenotypes observed in dfmr1 mutants. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that miR-219 regulates dFMR1 expression in Drosophila and is involved in fragile X syndrome pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings expand the current understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of target molecule-related functions. "
negative,"The molecular basis of social behavior: models, methods and advances. Elucidating the molecular and neural basis of complex social behaviors such as communal living, division of labor and warfare requires model organisms that exhibit these multi-faceted behavioral phenotypes. Social insects, such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, are attractive models to address this problem, with rich ecological and ethological foundations. However, their atypical systems of reproduction have hindered application of classical genetic approaches. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in social insect genomics, transcriptomics, and functional manipulations have enhanced our ability to observe and perturb gene expression, physiology and behavior in these species. Such developments begin to provide an integrated view of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of complex social behavior. "
negative,"Interaction of plant defense compounds with the insect gut: new insights from genomic and molecular analyses. The co-evolutionary conflict between insect herbivores and their host plants is profoundly influenced by biochemical reactions associated with passage of toxin-laden plant material through the herbivore digestive canal. Insect herbivores provide excellent models in which to understand the mechanistic interplay between nutrition and detoxification, how plant defense compounds hijack these processes, and how insects adapt to host defense chemistry. Expanding genome sequence information and genetic approaches to manipulate gene function in both interacting partners are providing new insights into the genetic underpinnings of host preference and plasticity in gut physiology. Fundamental knowledge gained from these studies has practical application in understanding how insects evolve resistance to pesticides, and may also inform efforts to better understand how plant chemicals impact human health. "
negative,"Complete mitochondrial genome of the stonefly Cryptoperla stilifera Sivec (Plecoptera: Peltoperlidae) and the phylogeny of Polyneopteran insects. We present the complete mitogenome of a stonefly, Cryptoperla stilifera Sivec (Plecoptera; Peltoperlidae). The mitogenome was a circular molecule consisting of 15,633 nucleotides, 37 genes and a A+T-rich region. C. stilifera mitogenome was similar to Pteronarcys princeps mitogenome (Plecoptera; Pteronarcyidae). All transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) had typical cloverleaf secondary structures except for trnSer (AGN), where the stem-loop structure of the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm was missing. The A+T-rich region of C. stilifera had two stem-loops and each had two interlink. Three conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) were present in the A+T-rich regions of C. stilifera, Peltoperla tarteri and Peltoperla arcuata. Moreover, many polynucleotide stretches (Poly N, N=A, T and C) in the A+T-rich region of C. stilifera Phylogenetic relationships of Polyneopteran species were constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs). Both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses supported Grylloblattodea as the sister group to Plecoptera+Dermaptera and Embiidina and Phasmatodea as sister groups. "
negative,"Enhanced production of spinosad in Saccharopolyspora spinosa by genome shuffling. Spinosad (spinosyns A and D) is a mixture of secondary metabolites produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is used in agriculture as a potent insect control agent with exceptional safety to non-target organisms. In this study, we applied genome shuffling of S. spinosa to achieve a rapid improvement of spinosad production. Ten strains with subtle improvements in spinosad production were obtained from the populations generated by the mutation with nitrosoguanidine and ultraviolet irradiation, and then they were subjected for recursive protoplast fusion. After four rounds of genome shuffling, a high yielding strain, designated as S. spinosa 4-7, was successfully isolated. Its production reached 547 mg / L, which was increased by 200.55% and 436.27% in comparison with that of the highest parent strain and the original strain, respectively. The subculture experiments indicated that the high producer of S. spinosa 4-7 was stable. Spinosad fermentation experiments by S. spinosa 4-7 were carried out in a 5-L fermentor, and its production of spinosad reached 428 mg / L after 168 h of fermentation. "
negative,"Bombyx small RNAs: genomic defense system against transposons in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Selfish genetic elements called transposons can insert themselves at new locations in host genomes to modify gene structure and alter gene expression. Expansion of transposons can occur when novel transposition events are transmitted to subsequent generations after germline hopping. Therefore, organisms seem likely to have evolved defense mechanisms to silence transposons in the germline. Recently, small RNAs interacting with Piwi proteins (piwi-interacting RNAs: piRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in genomic defense mechanism against transposons. Here, we show that piRNA-like small RNAs are present abundantly in the Bombyx ovary. We cloned 38,493 kinds of Bombyx small RNA from the ovary and performed functional characterization. Bombyx small RNAs showed a unimodal length distribution with a peak at 28nt and a strong bias for U at the 5' end. We found that 12,869 kinds of Bombyx small RNAs were associated with transposons or repetitive sequences. We classified them as repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs), a subclass of piRNAs. Notably, antisense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward U at 5' ends; in contrast, sense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward A at nucleotide position 10, indicating that the piRNA amplification loop proposed in Drosophila is evolutionarily conserved in Bombyx. These results suggest that Bombyx small RNAs regulate transposon activity. "
negative,"The pea aphid genome sequence brings theories of insect defense into question. The genome sequence of the pea aphid is the first for a basal hemimetabolous insect and provides insights into developmental plasticity, symbiosis and insect immunity. "
negative,"Genetic diversity of Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi related to biting behavior in western Amazon. BACKGROUND: In the Amazon Basin, Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi is the most aggressive and effective malaria vector. In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution. METHODS: To investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (~ 20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (~ 8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn). RESULTS: Genome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and FST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genomes of soft ticks have an arrangement of genes that has remained unchanged for over 400 million years. There are two major groups of ticks: soft ticks and hard ticks. The hard ticks comprise the prostriate ticks and the metastriate ticks. The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of one species of prostriate tick and two species of metastriate ticks had been sequenced prior to our study. The prostriate tick has the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the two metastriate ticks have rearrangements of eight genes and duplicate control regions. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of soft ticks had not been studied. We sequenced the mt genomes of two species of soft ticks, Carios capensis and Ornithodoros moubata, and a metastriate tick, Haemaphysalis flava. We found that the soft ticks have the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the metastriate tick, H. flava, shares the rearrangements of mt genes and duplicate control regions with the other two metastriate ticks that have previously been studied. Our study indicates that gene rearrangements and duplicate control regions in mt genomes occurred once in the most recent common ancestor of metastriate ticks, whereas the ancestral arrangement of arthropods has remained unchanged for over 400 million years in the lineages leading to the soft ticks and the prostriate ticks. "
negative,"Multiple coding sequences for the genome-linked virus protein (VPg) in dicistroviruses. N-terminal Edman sequencing of the genome-linked viral protein (VPg) of Plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV, Dicistroviridae) detected heterologus residues. The VPg sequence determined was found to be triplicated in the nonstructural protein precursor. Multiple VPg-like sequences were also found in 10 of the 12 dicistroviruses with a maximum of six copies in Solenopsis invicta virus-1. We postulate that redundant VPg coding sequences facilitate multiplication of dicistroviruses, because fewer cycle of translation of the nonstructural protein precursor produces larger amounts of VPg proteins in parallel with the increased production of capsid proteins by the intergenic internal ribosome entry site mediated translation. "
negative,"Mosquito-borne Inkoo virus in northern Sweden - isolation and whole genome sequencing. BACKGROUND: Inkoo virus (INKV) is a less known mosquito-borne virus belonging to Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus, California serogroup. Studies indicate that INKV infection is mainly asymptomatic, but can cause mild encephalitis in humans. In northern Europe, the sero-prevalence against INKV is high, 41% in Sweden and 51% in Finland. Previously, INKV RNA has been detected in adult Aedes (Ae.) communis, Ae. hexodontus and Ae. punctor mosquitoes and Ae. communis larvae, but there are still gaps of knowledge regarding mosquito vectors and genetic diversity. Therefore, we aimed to determine the occurrence of INKV in its mosquito vector and characterize the isolates. METHODS: About 125,000 mosquitoes were collected during a mosquito-borne virus surveillance in northern Sweden during the summer period of 2015. Of these, 10,000 mosquitoes were processed for virus isolation and detection using cell culture and RT-PCR. Virus isolates were further characterized by whole genome sequencing. Genetic typing of mosquito species was conducted by cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene amplification and sequencing (genetic barcoding). RESULTS: Several Ae. communis mosquitoes were found positive for INKV RNA and two isolates were obtained. The first complete sequences of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments of INKV in Sweden were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the INKV genome was most closely related to other INKV isolates from Sweden and Finland. Of the three INKV genome segments, the INKV M segment had the highest frequency of non-synonymous mutations. The overall G / C-content of INKV genes was low for the N / NSs genes (43.8-45.5%), polyprotein (Gn / Gc / NSm) gene (35.6%) and the RNA polymerase gene (33.8%) This may be due to the fact that INKV in most instances utilized A or T in the third codon position. CONCLUSIONS: INKV is frequently circulating in northern Sweden and Ae. communis is the key vector. The high mutation rate of the INKV M segment may have consequences on virulence. "
negative,"Ecological genomics of Boechera stricta: identification of a QTL controlling the allocation of methionine- vs branched-chain amino acid-derived glucosinolates and levels of insect herbivory. In the Brassicaceae, glucosinolates influence the feeding, reproduction and development of many insect herbivores. Glucosinolate production and effects on herbivore feeding have been extensively studied in the model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica crops, both of which constitutively produce leaf glucosinolates mostly derived from the amino acid, methionine. Much less is known about the regulation or role in defense of glucosinolates derived from other aliphatic amino acids, such as the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), valine and isoleucine. We have identified a glucosinolate polymorphism in Boechera stricta controlling the allocation to BCAA- vs methionine-derived glucosinolates in both leaves and seeds. B. stricta is a perennial species that grows in mostly undisturbed habitats of western North America. We have measured glucosinolate profiles and concentrations in 192 F(2) lines that have earlier been used for genetic map construction. We also performed herbivory assays on six F(3) replicates per F(2) line using the generalist lepidopteran, Trichoplusia ni. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a single locus controlling both glucosinolate profile and levels of herbivory, the branched chain-methionine allocation or BCMA QTL. We have delimited this QTL to a small genomic region with a 1.0 LOD confidence interval just 1.9 cm wide, which, in A. thaliana, contains approximately 100 genes. We also found that methionine-derived glucosinolates provided significantly greater defense than the BCAA-derived glucosinolates against feeding by this generalist insect herbivore. The future positional cloning of this locus will allow for testing various adaptive explanations. "
negative,"The life cycle of a genome project: perspectives and guidelines inspired by insect genome projects. Many research programs on non-model species biology have been empowered by genomics. In turn, genomics is underpinned by a reference sequence and ancillary information created by so-called ""genome projects"". The most reliable genome projects are the ones created as part of an active research program and designed to address specific questions but their life extends past publication. In this opinion paper I outline four key insights that have facilitated maintaining genomic communities: the key role of computational capability, the iterative process of building genomic resources, the value of community participation and the importance of manual curation. Taken together, these ideas can and do ensure the longevity of genome projects and the growing non-model species community can use them to focus a discussion with regards to its future genomic infrastructure.  "
negative,"Caterpillars evolved from onychophorans by hybridogenesis. I reject the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor. Rather I posit that, in animals that metamorphose, the basic types of larvae originated as adults of different lineages, i.e., larvae were transferred when, through hybridization, their genomes were acquired by distantly related animals. ""Caterpillars,"" the name for eruciforms with thoracic and abdominal legs, are larvae of lepidopterans, hymenopterans, and mecopterans (scorpionflies). Grubs and maggots, including the larvae of beetles, bees, and flies, evolved from caterpillars by loss of legs. Caterpillar larval organs are dismantled and reconstructed in the pupal phase. Such indirect developmental patterns (metamorphoses) did not originate solely by accumulation of random mutations followed by natural selection; rather they are fully consistent with my concept of evolution by hybridogenesis. Members of the phylum Onychophora (velvet worms) are proposed as the evolutionary source of caterpillars and their grub or maggot descendants. I present a molecular biological research proposal to test my thesis. By my hypothesis 2 recognizable sets of genes are detectable in the genomes of all insects with caterpillar grub- or maggot-like larvae: (i) onychophoran genes that code for proteins determining larval morphology / physiology and (ii) sequentially expressed insect genes that code for adult proteins. The genomes of insects and other animals that, by contrast, entirely lack larvae comprise recognizable sets of genes from single animal common ancestors. "
negative,"Comprehensive identification of Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning genes using a whole-genome tiling array. Dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo is initiated by Dorsal, a sequence-specific transcription factor distributed in a broad nuclear gradient in the precellular embryo. Previous studies have identified as many as 70 protein-coding genes and one microRNA (miRNA) gene that are directly or indirectly regulated by this gradient. A gene regulation network, or circuit diagram, including the functional interconnections among 40 Dorsal target genes and 20 associated tissue-specific enhancers, has been determined for the initial stages of gastrulation. Here, we attempt to extend this analysis by identifying additional DV patterning genes using a recently developed whole-genome tiling array. This analysis led to the identification of another 30 protein-coding genes, including the Drosophila homolog of Idax, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. In addition, remote 5' exons were identified for at least 10 of the approximately 100 protein-coding genes that were missed in earlier annotations. As many as nine intergenic uncharacterized transcription units were identified, including two that contain known microRNAs, miR-1 and -9a. We discuss the potential functions of these recently identified genes and suggest that intronic enhancers are a common feature of the DV gene network. "
negative,"Agricultural applications of insect ecological genomics. Agricultural entomology is poised to benefit from the application of ecological genomics, particularly the fields of biofuels generation and pest control. Metagenomic methods can characterize microbial communities of termites, wood-boring beetles and livestock pests, and transcriptomic approaches reveal molecular bases behind wood-digesting capabilities of these insects, leading to potential mechanisms for biofuel generation. Genome sequences are being exploited to develop new pest control methods, identify candidate antigens to vaccinate livestock, and discover RNAi target sequences and potential non-target effects in other insects. Gene content analyses of pest genome sequences and their endosymbionts suggest metabolic interdependencies between organisms, exposing potential gene targets for insect control. Finally, genome-wide association studies and genotyping by high-throughput sequencing promise to improve management of pesticide resistance. "
negative,"Assessing gene expression during pathogenesis: Use of qRT-PCR to follow toxin production in the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana during infection and immune response of the insect host Triatoma infestans. Entomopathogenic fungi secrete toxic secondary metabolites during the invasion of the insect hemocoel as part of the infection process. Although these compounds have been frequently mentioned as virulence factors, the roles of many of them remain poorly understood, including the question of whether they are expressed during the infection process. A major hurdle to this issue remains the low sensitivity of biochemical detection techniques (e.g., HPLC) within the complex samples that may contain trace quantities of fungal molecules inside the insect. In this study, quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the transcript levels within the insect fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana, that encode for the synthetase enzymes of the secondary metabolites tenellin (BbtenS), beauvericin (BbbeaS) and bassianolide (BbbslS) during the infection of Triatoma infestans, a Chagas disease insect vector. Absolute quantification was performed at different time periods after insect treatment with various concentrations of propagules, either by immersing the insects in conidial suspensions or by injecting them with blastospores. Both BbtenS and BbbeaS were highly expressed in conidia-treated insects at days 3 and 12 post-treatment. In blastospore-injected insects, BbtenS and BbbeaS expression peaked at 24h post-injection and were also highly expressed in insect cadavers. The levels of BbbslS transcripts were much lower in all conditions tested. The expression patterns of insect genes encoding proteins that belong to the T. infestans humoral immune system were also evaluated with the same technique. This qPCR-based methodology can contribute to decifering the dynamics of entomopathogenic fungal infection at the molecular level.  "
negative,"Expression- and genomic-level changes during passage of four baculoviruses derived from bacmids in permissive insect cell lines. The baculovirus-based bacmid expression vector system has been widely used for protein production in basic research and biotechnological laboratories. Since the first construction of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid (AcBacmid), three more bacmids have been created from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmBacmid), Spodoptera exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeBacmid) and Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaBacmid). Each of these bacmid-derived viruses replicates efficiently in a range of specific and permissive cell types. Here, we investigated the relative stability of each virus derived from the bacmid during passage in permissive cell lines through assessment of their expression level and genome structure changes. Using two different reporters, the expression levels of the viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf9, AcBacmid-Tn5, BmBacmid-BmN and SeBacmid-SeE1 bacmid-cell systems were significantly reduced after five passages of the viruses, whereas the reductions were not detected in the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 systems. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of viral DNA isolated from passaged viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 systems showed no major genomic changes. In contrast, the genomes from passaged viruses in the AcBacmid-Tn5 and AcBacmid-Sf9 systems displayed reduced genome size and various mutations at individual loci, including genotypes missing one at least or more viral RNA polymerase subunits and fp25k. These genotypic changes were correlated with reduced protein expression. RFLP analysis of viral DNA from passaged viruses in the BmBacmid-BmN and SeBacmid-SeE1 systems exhibited changes in genome size, including excision of particular EcoRI fragments containing the mini-F replicon. Collectively, our data suggest that the viruses from the AcBacmid-Sf21 and HaBacmid-HzAM1 bacmid-cell systems are better for large-scale protein expression in continuous culture. Further study is needed to investigate the mechanism(s) behind the protein expression reduction in these bacmid-derived virus / cell systems. "
negative,"Microarray analysis of kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) bark following challenge by the sucking insect Hemiberlesia lataniae (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). Both commercial and experimental genotypes of kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) exhibit large differences in response to insect pests. An understanding of the vine's physiological response to insect feeding and its genetic basis will be important in assisting the development of varieties with acceptable levels of pest resistance. This experiment describes transcriptome changes observed in the bark of kiwifruit 2 and 7 days after the commencement of feeding by the armored scale insect pest, Hemiberlesia lataniae. Using a cDNA microarray consisting of 17,512 unigenes, we measured transcriptome changes and analyzed these into functional ontology categories using MapMan. Results are available in the GEO database GSE73922 and are described fully in Ref. Hill et al. (2015) [1]. After 7 days, transcripts associated with photosynthesis were down-regulated and secondary metabolism was up-regulated. Differential expression of transcripts associated with stress response was consistent with a defense response involving both effector and herbivore-triggered immunities, with predominant involvement of the salicylic acid phytohormonal pathway. This hypothesis was supported by the results of two laboratory experiments. The methods described here could be further adapted and applied to the study of plant responses to a wide range of sessile sucking pests.  "
negative,"Gene expression profiling of tolerant barley in response to Diuraphis noxia (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding. Aphids are, arguably, the single most damaging group of agricultural insect pests throughout the world. Plant tolerance, which is a plant response to an insect pest, is viewed as an excellent management strategy. Developing testable hypotheses based on genome-wide and more focused methods will help in understanding the molecular underpinnings of plant tolerance to aphid herbivory. As a first step in this process, we undertook transcript profiling with Affymetrix GeneChip Barley Genome arrays using RNA extracted from tissues of tolerant and susceptible genotypes collected at three hours, three days and six days after Diuraphis noxia introduction. Acquired data were compared to identify changes unique to the tolerant barley at each harvest date. Transcript abundance of 4086 genes was differentially changed over the three harvest dates in tolerant and susceptible barley in response to D. noxia feeding. Across the three harvest dates, the greatest number of genes was differentially expressed in both barleys at three days after aphid introduction. A total of 909 genes showed significant levels of change in the tolerant barley in response to D. noxia feeding as compared to susceptible plants infested with aphids. Many of these genes could be assigned to specific metabolic categories, including several associated with plant defense and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, two peroxidase genes, designated HvPRXA1 and HvPRXA2, were up-regulated to a greater degree in response to D. noxia feeding on tolerant barley plants, indicating that specific peroxidases could be important for the tolerance process. These findings suggest that the ability to elevate and sustain levels of ROS-scavenging enzymes could play an important role in the tolerant response. "
positive,"Sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on molting hormone levels and mRNA expressions of three Halloween genes in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. While sublethal effects of insecticide on insect development have been widely studied, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Our previous studies revealed that sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole significantly increased the juvenile hormone levels and resulted in both prolonged developmental time and reduced fecundity in Chilo suppressalis. In the present study, we evaluated the sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on molting hormone (MH) levels and mRNA expressions of three Halloween genes including CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 in C. suppressalis. The results showed that the MH levels in different developmental stages of C. suppressalis were decreased after exposure to LC10 and LC30 of chlorantraniliprole. However, analysis of temporal expression profiles revealed that the mRNA levels of three Halloween genes were not closely correlated with the ecdysteroid titers in C. suppressalis. Notably, the transcript levels of CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 were induced after treatment with sublethal concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in specific developmental stages. These results indicated that chlorantraniliprole had adverse effects on insect MH biosynthesis, and in addition to the involvement in MH biosynthesis, CsCYP307A1, CsCYP306A1 and CsCYP314A1 may also play important roles in the detoxification metabolism of chlorantraniliprole in C. suppressalis. "
positive,"A gut-specific chitinase gene essential for regulation of chitin content of peritrophic matrix and growth of Ostrinia nubilalis larvae. Chitinases belong to a large and diverse family of hydrolytic enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds of chitin. However, very little is known about the function of chitinase genes in regulating the chitin content in peritrophic matrix (PM) of the midgut in insects. We identified a cDNA putatively encoding a chitinase (OnCht) in European corn borer (ECB; Ostrinia nubilalis). The OnCht transcript was predominately found in larval midgut but undetectable in eggs, pupae, or adults. When the larvae were fed on an artificial diet, the OnCht transcript level increased by 4.4-fold but the transcript level of a gut-specific chitin synthase (OnCHS2) gene decreased by 2.5-fold as compared with those of unfed larvae. In contrast, when the larvae were fed with the food and then starved for 24h, the OnCht transcript level decreased by 1.8-fold but the transcript level of OnCHS2 increased by 1.8-fold. Furthermore, there was a negative relationship between OnCht transcript level and chitin content in the midgut. By using a feeding-based RNAi technique, we were able to reduce the OnCht transcript level by 63-64% in the larval midgut. Consequently, these larvae showed significantly increased chitin content (26%) in the PM but decreased larval body weight (54%) as compared with the control larvae fed on the diet containing GFP dsRNA. Therefore, for the first time, we provide strong evidence that OnCht plays an important role in regulating chitin content of the PM and subsequently affecting the growth and development of the ECB larvae. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome characterization of Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and its phylogenetic relationship with other lepidopteran insects. The complete mitogenome of the potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) was sequenced, annotated, characterized and compared with 140 species of the order Lepidoptera. The circular genome is 15,251 bp, containing 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and an A+T-rich region). The gene arrangement was identical to other lepidopteran mitogenomes but different from the ancestral arrangement found in most insects for the tRNA-Met gene (A+T-region, tRNA-I, tRNA-Q, tRNA-M). The mitogenome of T. solanivora is highly A+T-biased (78.2%) and exhibits negative AT- and GC-skews. All PCGs are initiated by canonical ATN start codons, except for Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 (COI), which is initiated by CGA. Most PCGs have a complete typical stop codon (TAA). Only NAD1 has a TAG stop codon and the COII and NAD5 genes have an incomplete stop codon consisting of just a T. The A+T-rich region is 332 bp long and contains common features found in lepidopteran mitogenomes, including the 'ATAGA' motif, a 17 bp poly (T) stretch and a (AT)8 element preceded by the 'ATTTA' motif. Other tandem repeats like (TAA)4 and (TAT)7 were found, as well as (T)6 and (A)10 mononucleotide repeat elements. Finally, this mitogenome has 20 intergenic spacer regions. The phylogenetic relationship of T. solanivora with 28 other lepidopteran families (12 superfamilies) showed that taxonomic classification by morphological features coincides with the inferred phylogeny. Thus, the Gelechiidae family represents a monophyletic group, suggesting that T. solanivora and Pectinophora gossypiella have a recent common ancestor. "
negative,"Identification of the Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) peritrophic matrix proteins and enzymes involved in peritrophic matrix chitin metabolism. The peritrophic matrix (PM) is essential for insect digestive system physiology as it protects the midgut epithelium from damage by food particles, pathogens, and toxins. The PM is also an attractive target for development of new pest control strategies due to its per os accessibility. To understand how the PM performs these functions, the molecular architecture of the PM was examined using genomic and proteomic approaches in Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major pest of cruciferous oilseed crops in North America. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the PM identified 82 proteins classified as: (i) peritrophins, including a new class with a CBDIII domain; (ii) enzymes involved in chitin modification (chitin deacetylases), digestion (serine proteases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, lipases and α-amylase) or other reactions (β-1,3-glucanase, alkaline phosphatase, dsRNase, astacin, pantetheinase); (iii) a heterogenous group consisting of polycalin, REPATs, serpin, C-Type lectin and Lsti99 / Lsti201 and 3 novel proteins without known orthologs. The genes encoding PM proteins were expressed predominantly in the midgut. cDNAs encoding chitin synthase-2 (McCHS-2), chitinase (McCHI), and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (McNAG) enzymes, involved in PM chitin metabolism, were also identified. McCHS-2 expression was specific to the midgut indicating that it is responsible for chitin synthesis in the PM, the only chitinous material in the midgut. In contrast, the genes encoding the chitinolytic enzymes were expressed in multiple tissues. McCHS-2, McCHI, and McNAG were expressed in the midgut of feeding larvae, and NAG activity was present in the PM. This information was used to generate an updated model of the lepidopteran PM architecture.  "
negative,"A de novo transcriptome of European pollen beetle populations and its analysis, with special reference to insecticide action and resistance. The pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus is the most important coleopteran pest in European oilseed rape cultivation, annually infesting millions of hectares and responsible for substantial yield losses if not kept under economic damage thresholds. This species is primarily controlled with insecticides but has recently developed high levels of resistance to the pyrethroid class. The aim of the present study was to provide a transcriptomic resource to investigate mechanisms of resistance. cDNA was sequenced on both Roche (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and Illumina (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) platforms, resulting in a total of ∼53 m reads which assembled into 43 396 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Manual annotation revealed good coverage of genes encoding insecticide target sites and detoxification enzymes. A total of 77 nonredundant cytochrome P450 genes were identified. Mapping of Illumina RNAseq sequences (from susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains) against the reference transcriptome identified a cytochrome P450 (CYP6BQ23) as highly overexpressed in pyrethroid resistance strains. Single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis confirmed the presence of a target-site resistance mutation (L1014F) in the voltage-gated sodium channel of one resistant strain. Our results provide new insights into the important genes associated with pyrethroid resistance in M. aeneus. Furthermore, a comprehensive EST resource is provided for future studies on insecticide modes of action and resistance mechanisms in pollen beetle.  "
positive,"Study of the aminopeptidase N gene family in the lepidopterans Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) and Bombyx mori (L.): sequences, mapping and expression. Aminopeptidases N (APNs) are a class of ectoenzymes present in lepidopteran larvae midguts, involved in the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins mode of action. In the present work, seven aminopeptidases have been cloned from the midgut of Ostrinia nubilalis, the major Lepidopteran corn pest in the temperate climates. Six sequences were identified as APNs because of the presence of the HEXXH(X)18E and GAMEN motifs, as well as the signal peptide and the GPI-anchor sequences. The remaining sequence did not contain the two cellular targeting signals, indicating it belonged to the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) family. An in silico analysis allowed us to find orthologous sequences in Bombyx mori. A phylogenetic study of lepidopteran aminopeptidase sequences resulted in their clustering into nine classes. Linkage analysis revealed that the onapn genes as well as all bmapn genes clustered in a single linkage group. O. nubilalis aminopeptidases were expressed in all larval instars. In 5th instar larvae tissues, apns transcripts were found mainly in midguts while apn8 was also highly expressed in Malpighian tubules, and psa showed an ubiquitous expression pattern in O. nubilalis and B. mori. The sequence homology and gene organization of apns suggest a single origin from an ancestral lepidopteran apn gene. "
positive,"Expression Patterns, Molecular Characterization, and Response to Host Stress of CYP Genes from Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). The quarantine insect pest Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) has a broad host range and is distributed worldwide. Each year, P. solenopsis causes significant crop losses. The detoxification of various xenobiotic compounds involves the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) superfamily of enzymes. However, the functions of CYPs in P. solenopsis are poorly understood. In the present study, P. solenopsis was reared from the egg to the adult stage on three host plants: Tomato, cotton, and hibiscus. Thirty-seven P. solenopsis CYP genes were identified and their phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. Eleven CYP genes (PsCYP4NT1, PsCYP4G219, PsCYP6PZ1, PsCYP6PZ5, PsCYP301B1, PsCYP302A1, PsCYP305A22, PsCYP315A1, PsCYP353F1, PsCYP3634A1, and PsCYP3635A2) were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The results demonstrated marked differences in CYP expression levels in P. solenopsis grown on different host plants. The results will aid the molecular characterization of CYPs and will increase our understanding of CYP expression patterns in P. solenopsis during development and growth on different hosts. "
positive,"RNA interference in Nilaparvata lugens (Homoptera: Delphacidae) based on dsRNA ingestion. BACKGROUND: An efficient and convenient RNA interference (RNAi) technique involving double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion is useful for gene function studies of non-model insects. RESULTS: Three dsRNAs targeting different sites within a gene encoding vacuolar ATP synthase subunit E (V-ATPase-E, 21E01) were synthesised for RNAi in Nilaparvata lugens. dsRNA was found to be stable in 0.1 g mL(-1) sucrose solution, but unstable in artificial fodder. Therefore, dsRNAs were orally delivered into N. lugens in 0.1 g mL(-1) sucrose solution. RNAi was induced by all three of the dsRNAs at 0.05 µg µL(-1) in N. lugens. Time dynamics analysis of gene silencing indicated that significant suppression of the target gene began as early as 2 days after ingestion of ds2-21E01 and ds3-21E01. However, significant repressive effects were recorded up to 10 days after exposure to ds1-21E01. The maximum reduction in target gene mRNA was observed after 10 days of treatment, with suppression ratios induced by ds1-21E01, ds2-21E01 and ds3-21E01 of 41, 55 and 48% respectively. CONCLUSION: An efficient and convenient RNAi technique involving dsRNA ingestion has been successfully developed for N. lugens. This will be a useful tool for further functional genomic investigation in this organism. "
negative,"Complete Genome Sequence of a Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain Isolated from a Known Cotton Insect Boll Vector. Klebsiella pneumoniae (associated with bacterial pneumonia) was previously isolated from Nezara viridula, a significant vector of cotton boll-rot pathogens. We provide the first annotated genome sequence of the cotton opportunistic strain K. pneumoniae 5-1. This data provides guidance to study the bases of cotton pathogenesis by bacteria associated with vectors.  "
negative,"Gambol and Tc1 are two distinct families of DD34E transposons: analysis of the Anopheles gambiae genome expands the diversity of the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily. Tc1 is a family of DNA transposons found in diverse organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates and fungi. Tc1 belongs to the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily, which is characterized by common 'TA' target site and conserved D(Asp)DE(Glu) or DDD catalytic triad. All functional Tc1-like transposons contain a transposase with a DD34E catalytic triad. We conducted a systematic analysis of DD34E transposons in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, using a reiterative and exhaustive search program. In addition to previously described Tc1-like elements, we uncovered 26 new DD34E transposons including a novel family that we named gambol. Designation of family status to gambol is based on phylogenetic analyses of transposase sequences that showed gambol and Tc1 transposons as distinct clades that were separated by mariner and other families of the IS630-Tc1-mariner superfamily. The distinction between Tc1 and gambol is also consistent with the unique TIRs in gambol elements and the presence of a 'W[I / L / V]DEDC' signature near their N-termini. This signature is predicted as part of the 'RED' domain, a component of the 'PAI' and 'RED' DNA binding domains in Tc1 and possibly mariner. Although gambol appears to be related to a few DD34E transposons from cyanobacteria and fungi, no gambol has been reported in any other insects or animals thus far. Several gambol and Tc1 elements have intact ORFs and different genomic copies with high sequence identity, which suggests that they may have been recently active. "
negative,"Limited Genetic Structure of Gypsy Moth Populations Reflecting a Recent History in Europe. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, a prominent polyphagous species native to Eurasia, causes severe impacts in deciduous forests during irregular periodical outbreaks. This study aimed to describe the genetic structure and diversity among European gypsy moth populations. Analysis of about 500 individuals using a partial region of the mitochondrial COI gene, L. dispar was characterized by low genetic diversity, limited population structure, and strong evidence that all extant haplogroups arose via a single Holocene population expansion event. Overall 60 haplotypes connected to a single parsimony network were detected and genetic diversity was highest for the coastal populations Croatia, Italy, and France, while lowest in continental populations. Phylogenetic reconstruction resulted in three groups that were geographically located in Central Europe, Dinaric Alps, and the Balkan Peninsula. In addition to recent events, the genetic structure reflects strong gene flow and the ability of gypsy moth to feed on about 400 deciduous and conifer species. Distinct genetic groups were detected in populations from Georgia. This remote population exhibited haplotypes intermediate to the European L. dispar dispar, Asian L. dispar asiatica, and L. dispar japonica clusters, highlighting this area as a possible hybridization zone of this species for future studies applying genomic approaches. "
negative,"Characterization of genomic DNA encoding cecropins from an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line. We used cDNA probes from Aedes albopictus mosquito cecropins AalCecA, B, and C to obtain genomic DNA copies and flanking DNA. Two gene copies (AalCecA1 and A2, AalCecB1 and B2, AalCecC1 and C2) encoding each of the three mature cecropin peptides were recovered. All these genes had a similar organization, into two exons interrupted by a single short intron. AalCecA1 and AalCecA2 encode mature protein products that differ by one amino acid residue, while AalCecB1 and AalCecB2, AalCecC1 and AalCecC2 encode identical mature cecropin peptides, respectively. The AalCecB and C gene pairs each share a common intergenic region of approximately 1 kb, with the two coding regions transcribed in opposite directions. With the exception of small insertions / deletions, the intergenic spacer region was highly conserved between the B1 / C1 and B2 / C2 clones. In transfected cells, 0.8 kb of upstream sequence was sufficient for inducible expression of AalCecA1. Within this region, a 28 bp sequence at positions -192 to -165 upstream of the transcription initiation site was found to contain a potential regulatory element. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, synthetic double-stranded DNA containing this 28 bp sequence retarded protein in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from C7-10 cells. "
negative,"Social evolution. Genomic signatures of evolutionary transitions from solitary to group living. The evolution of eusociality is one of the major transitions in evolution, but the underlying genomic changes are unknown. We compared the genomes of 10 bee species that vary in social complexity, representing multiple independent transitions in social evolution, and report three major findings. First, many important genes show evidence of neutral evolution as a consequence of relaxed selection with increasing social complexity. Second, there is no single road map to eusociality; independent evolutionary transitions in sociality have independent genetic underpinnings. Third, though clearly independent in detail, these transitions do have similar general features, including an increase in constrained protein evolution accompanied by increases in the potential for gene regulation and decreases in diversity and abundance of transposable elements. Eusociality may arise through different mechanisms each time, but would likely always involve an increase in the complexity of gene networks.  "
positive,"RNAi-Mediated Knockdown of Tssk1 and Tektin1 Genes Impair Male Fertility in Bactrocera dorsalis. The genetic-based sterile insect technique (SIT) is an effective and environmentally safe strategy to diminish populations of agricultural and horticultural insect pests. Functional characterization of genes related to male fertility can enhance the genetic-based SIT. Tssk1 has been involved to control male fertility in both mammals and insects. Moreover, Tektin1 has also been revealed to influence male fertility in both human and mammals. These findings suggested that Tssk1 and Tektin1 identified from Bactrocera dorsalis could be required for male fertility in B. dorsalis. In this study, expression profiles of these two genes were studied at different developmental stages and in various tissues of adult males. Remarkably, it was found that Tssk1 and Tektin1 were highly expressed in the testis of mature adult males of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, Tssk1 and Tektin1 genes were downregulated by using the RNA interference (RNAi) method. Fertility assays including egg laying, hatching, and spermatozoa count were also performed to investigate male fertility of B. dorsalis. Results showed that knockdown of Tssk1 and Tektin1 caused male sterility up to 58.99% and 64.49%, respectively. As expected, the total numbers of spermatozoa were also significantly reduced by 65.83% and 73.9%, respectively. These results suggested that male sterility was happened wing to the low number of spermatozoa. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Tssk1 and Tektin1 are the novel agents that could be used to enhance the genetic-based SIT, or their double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can be used as biopesticides to control the population of B. dorsalis. "
negative,"Estimation of long terminal repeat element content in the Helicoverpa zea genome from high-throughput sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome pools. The lepidopteran pest insect Helicoverpa zea feeds on cultivated corn and cotton across the Americas where control remains challenging owing to the evolution of resistance to chemical and transgenic insecticidal toxins, yet genomic resources remain scarce for this species. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library having a mean genomic insert size of 145 ± 20 kbp was created from a laboratory strain of H. zea, which provides ∼12.9-fold coverage of a 362.8 ± 8.8 Mbp (0.37 ± 0.09 pg) flow cytometry estimated haploid genome size. Assembly of Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads generated from 14 pools that encompassed all BAC clones resulted in 165 485 genomic contigs (N50 = 3262 bp; 324.6 Mbp total). Long terminal repeat (LTR) protein coding regions annotated from 181 contigs included 30 Ty1 / copia, 78 Ty3 / gypsy, and 73 BEL / Pao elements, of which 60 (33.1%) encoded all five functional polyprotein (pol) domains. Approximately 14% of LTR elements are distributed non-randomly across pools of BAC clones. "
negative,"Ant genomics sheds light on the molecular regulation of social organization. Ants are powerful model systems for the study of cooperation and sociality. In this review, we discuss how recent advances in ant genomics have contributed to our understanding of the evolution and organization of insect societies at the molecular level.  "
negative,"Two different farnesyl diphosphate synthase genes exist in the genome of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS; EC 2.5.1.1, 2.5.1.10) catalyzes biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate, which is important to insects as the precursor of juvenile hormone and the substrate for (E)-beta-farnesene synthase. Here, two FPS cDNAs were isolated from the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (EU334430 and EU334431). Their shared identity within the coding region is approximately 82%. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two M. persicae FPS cDNAs have the highly conserved motifs characteristic of most known FPSs. Phylogenetic analyses showed that they are closely related to other insect FPSs. Homology modeling of structures suggested a very good fit between the three-dimensional structures of the two putative M. persicae FPSs (designated as MpFPS1 and MpFPS2) and the avian FPS crystal structure. The corresponding genomic DNA sequences were subsequently determined (EU429295 and EU429296). Sequence comparisons revealed a different splicing pattern between the two MpFPS genes. Furthermore, the two MpFPS genes exhibited a seemingly very primitive gene-splicing pattern at 5' ends but a gene-splicing style similar to mammalian FPS genes at 3' ends. These data, combined with results of Southern blotting, suggest that M. persicae contains two different FPS genes. This is the first report that two different FPS genes exist in a hemipteran insect. "
negative,"Quinolizidine and Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Chemical Ecology - a Mini-Review on Their Similarities and Differences. This mini-review summarizes over 40 years of research on quinolizidine (QAs) and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Emphasis is on the chemical ecology of both groups of alkaloids, which serve as general defense compounds against herbivores for the plants producing them. For QAs and PAs, a number of insects (aphids, moths, beetles) have acquired tolerance. These specialists store the alkaloids and use them as defense chemicals against predators. In some PA sequestering moths, the adaptation is even more intricate and advanced. PAs can function as a morphogen to induce the formation of male coremata, inflatable organs that dissipate pheromones. In these insects, PAs are additionally used as a precursor for male pheromones. Female moths utilize their own PAs and those obtained from males via the spermatophore as nuptial gift, to transfer them to the eggs that thus become chemically protected. Novel genomic technologies will allow deeper insights in the molecular evolution of these two classes of alkaloids in plant-insect interactions. "
positive,"Life-span phenotypes of elav and Rbp9 in Drosophila suggest functional cooperation of the two ELAV-family protein genes. The ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins is involved in various aspects of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, from alternative splicing to translation. The members of this family have been shown to interact with each other and have been suggested to function as homo- and / or hetero-multimers. However, the functional interactions among them have not been demonstrated in vivo. In this study, we examined the genetic interaction between elav and Rbp9, two of the three genes encoding ELAV-family proteins in Drosophila. Mutants of both elav and Rbp9 showed shorter life spans than the control, with elav showing a shorter life span than Rbp9. The survival curve of elav-Rbp9 double-mutant flies was indistinguishable from that of elav single-mutant flies, suggesting that both mutations affect longevity through the same pathway. Considering the fact that both genes are co-expressed in adult neurons, we hypothesize that ELAV and Rbp9 cooperate to maintain the functional integrity of the adult nervous system. "
negative,"Attenuated virulence and genomic reductive evolution in the entomopathogenic bacterial symbiont species, Xenorhabdus poinarii. Bacteria of the genus Xenorhabdus are symbionts of soil entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Steinernema. This symbiotic association constitutes an insecticidal complex active against a wide range of insect pests. Unlike other Xenorhabdus species, Xenorhabdus poinarii is avirulent when injected into insects in the absence of its nematode host. We sequenced the genome of the X. poinarii strain G6 and the closely related but virulent X. doucetiae strain FRM16. G6 had a smaller genome (500-700 kb smaller) than virulent Xenorhabdus strains and lacked genes encoding potential virulence factors (hemolysins, type 5 secretion systems, enzymes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, and toxin-antitoxin systems). The genomes of all the X. poinarii strains analyzed here had a similar small size. We did not observe the accumulation of pseudogenes, insertion sequences or decrease in coding density usually seen as a sign of genomic erosion driven by genetic drift in host-adapted bacteria. Instead, genome reduction of X. poinarii seems to have been mediated by the excision of genomic blocks from the flexible genome, as reported for the genomes of attenuated free pathogenic bacteria and some facultative mutualistic bacteria growing exclusively within hosts. This evolutionary pathway probably reflects the adaptation of X. poinarii to specific host.  "
negative,"Raalin, a transcript enriched in the honey bee brain, is a remnant of genomic rearrangement in Hymenoptera. We identified a predicted compact cysteine-rich sequence in the honey bee genome that we called 'Raalin'. Raalin transcripts are enriched in the brain of adult honey bee workers and drones, with only minimum expression in other tissues or in pre-adult stages. Open-reading frame (ORF) homologues of Raalin were identified in the transcriptomes of fruit flies, mosquitoes and moths. The Raalin-like gene from Drosophila melanogaster encodes for a short secreted protein that is maximally expressed in the adult brain with negligible expression in other tissues or pre-imaginal stages. Raalin-like sequences have also been found in the recently sequenced genomes of six ant species, but not in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. As in the honey bee, the Raalin-like sequences of ants do not have an ORF. A comparison of the genome region containing Raalin in the genomes of bees, ants and the wasp provides evolutionary support for an extensive genome rearrangement in this sequence. Our analyses identify a new family of ancient cysteine-rich short sequences in insects in which insertions and genome rearrangements may have disrupted this locus in the branch leading to the Hymenoptera. The regulated expression of this transcript suggests that it has a brain-specific function. "
negative,"Site-specific, TALENs-mediated transformation of Bombyx mori. Transposon-based genetic transformation has facilitated insect functional genomics and new strategies of pest management. However, there is a need for alternative, site-specific approaches to overcome limitations of random integration (and associated position-effects) and potential instability of inserted transgenes. Here we describe a transposon-free, site-specific genetic transformation system mediated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a lepidopteran model insect. We successfully established a site-specific transgenic system with comparable transformation efficiency to transposon-based genetic transformation through microinjection of TALENs mRNA targeting the BmBLOS2 locus and a linearizable donor plasmid encoding an expression cassette of the DsRed2 red fluorescent protein. This system provides a valuable approach for insect transgenesis and will enable future functional gene analysis and generate novel applications in agricultural and medical insect pest-management technologies. "
negative,"A molecular concept of caste in insect societies. The term 'caste' is used to describe the division of reproductive labour that defines eusocial insect societies. The definition of 'caste' has been debated over the last 50 years, specifically with respect to the simplest insect societies; this raises the question of whether a simple categorisation of social behaviour by reproductive state alone is helpful. Gene-level analyses of behaviours of individuals in hymenopteran social insect societies now provide a new empirical base-line for defining caste and understanding the evolution and maintenance of a reproductive division of labour. We review this literature to identify a set of potential molecular signatures that, combined with behavioural, morphological and physiological data, help define caste more precisely; these signatures vary with the type of society, and are likely to be influenced by ecology, life-history, and stage in the colony cycle. We conclude that genomic approaches provide us with additional ways to help quantify and categorise caste, and behaviour in general. "
positive,"Knockdown of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and CYP6MS1 increases the susceptibility of Sitophilus zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. Terpinen-4-ol showed highly insecticidal activity to stored-grain pest Sitophilus zeamais, and cytochrome P450s were strongly induced in response to terpinen-4-ol fumigation. Understanding of the function of P450 enzyme system in the susceptibility to terpinen-4-ol in S. zeamais will benefit the potential application of terpinen-4-ol in controlling stored-grain pests. In the present study, the synergist piperonyl butoxide increased the toxicity of terpinen-4-ol to S. zeamais, with a synergism ratio of 3.5-fold. Two isoforms of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (SzCPR) were identified, with the difference at the N-terminal. SzCPR contained an N-terminal membrane anchor, FMN, FAD, and NADP binding domains. Expression levels of SzCPR were upregulated by tea tree oil (TTO) and its main constituent terpinen-4-ol under different concentrations and time periods. RNAi was generated for S. zeamais by feeding adults dsRNA and the knockdown of SzCPR increased the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol, with higher mortality of adults than control under terpinen-4-ol fumigation. Further RNAi analysis showed that P450 gene CYP6MS1 mediated the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. These results revealed that cytochrome P450 enzyme system, especially CYP6MS1 participated in the susceptibility of S. zeamais to terpinen-4-ol. The findings provided a foundation to clarify the metabolic mechanisms of terpinen-4-ol in stored-grain pests. "
negative,"Insight into the genetic components of community genetics: QTL mapping of insect association in a fast-growing forest tree. Identifying genetic sequences underlying insect associations on forest trees will improve the understanding of community genetics on a broad scale. We tested for genomic regions associated with insects in hybrid poplar using quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses conducted on data from a common garden experiment. The F2 offspring of a hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides) cross were assessed for seven categories of insect leaf damage at two time points, June and August. Positive and negative correlations were detected among damage categories and between sampling times. For example, sap suckers on leaves in June were positively correlated with sap suckers on leaves (P<0.001) but negatively correlated with skeletonizer damage (P<0.01) in August. The seven forms of leaf damage were used as a proxy for seven functional groups of insect species. Significant variation in insect association occurred among the hybrid offspring, including transgressive segregation of susceptibility to damage. NMDS analyses revealed significant variation and modest broad-sense heritability in insect community structure among genets. QTL analyses identified 14 genomic regions across 9 linkage groups that correlated with insect association. We used three genomics tools to test for putative mechanisms underlying the QTL. First, shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway genes co-located to 9 of the 13 QTL tested, consistent with the role of phenolic glycosides as defensive compounds. Second, two insect association QTL corresponded to genomic hotspots for leaf trait QTL as identified in previous studies, indicating that, in addition to biochemical attributes, leaf morphology may influence insect preference. Third, network analyses identified categories of gene models over-represented in QTL for certain damage types, providing direction for future functional studies. These results provide insight into the genetic components involved in insect community structure in a fast-growing forest tree.  "
negative,"Complete mitochondrial genome of Taharana fasciana (Insecta, Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and comparison with other Cicadellidae insects. Here, we describe the first complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of the leafhopper Taharana fasciana (Coelidiinae). The mitogenome sequence contains 15,161 bp with an A + T content of 77.9%. It includes 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one non-coding (A + T-rich) region; in addition, a repeat region is also present (GenBank accession no. KY886913). These genes / regions are in the same order as in the inferred insect ancestral mitogenome. All protein-coding genes have ATN as the start codon, and TAA or single T as the stop codons, except the gene ND3, which ends with TAG. Furthermore, we predicted the secondary structures of the rRNAs in T. fasciana. Six domains (domain III is absent in arthropods) and 41 helices were predicted for 16S rRNA, and 12S rRNA comprised three structural domains and 24 helices. Phylogenetic tree analysis confirmed that T. fasciana and other members of the Cicadellidae are clustered into a clade, and it identified the relationships among the subfamilies Deltocephalinae, Coelidiinae, Idiocerinae, Cicadellinae, and Typhlocybinae. "
negative,"Profile of the mosaic element BTMR1 in the genome of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Co-evolution involving a mariner transposon, Botmar1 and the other repeats contained in the Bombus terrestris genome was investigated. We found that the 5'-region of Botmar1 forms one of the components of a mosaic element, known as B. terrestris mosaic repeat 1 (BTMR1), which is also composed of inner segments originating from two different retrotransposons and a pseudogene corresponding to an RNA methyltransferase cDNA. The fact that BTMR1 is interspersed within chromosomes and the differences in its abundance in different species indicate that it is very probably a mobile element. Nevertheless, the absences of direct or inverted repeats at its ends and of target site duplication indicate that its mobility is not ensured by a cardinal transposable element, but putatively by a Crypton-like element. "
negative,"Genome of the African cassava whitefly Bemisia tabaci and distribution and genetic diversity of cassava-colonizing whiteflies in Africa. The whitefy Bemisia tabaci, a species complex consisting of many morphologically indistinguishable species divided into distinct clades, is one of the most globally important agricultural pests and plant virus vectors. Cassava-colonizing B. tabaci transmits viruses that cause cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). Half of all cassava plants in Africa are affected by these viral diseases, resulting in annual production losses of more than US$ 1 billion. Here we report the draft genome of the cassava whitefly B. tabaci Sub-Saharan Africa - East and Central Africa (SSA-ECA), the super-abundant population that has been associated with the rapid spread of viruses causing the pandemics of CMD and CBSD. The SSA-ECA genome assembled from Illumina short reads has a total size of 513.7 Mb and a scaffold N50 length of 497 kb, and contains 15,084 predicted protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that SSA-ECA diverged from MEAM1 around 5.26 million years ago. A comprehensive genetic analysis of cassava-colonizing B. tabaci in Africa was also conducted, in which a total of 243 whitefly specimens were collected from 18 countries representing all major cassava-growing regions in the continent and genotyped using NextRAD sequencing. Population genomic analyses confirmed the existence of six major populations linked by gene flow and inferred the distribution patterns of these populations across the African continent. The genome of SSA-ECA and the genetic findings provide valuable resources and guidance to facilitate whitefly research and the development of strategies to control cassava viral diseases spread by whiteflies. "
negative,"Molecular cloning and characterization of a putative proline dehydrogenase gene in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Leptinotarsa decemlineata adults exhibit a season-dependent activity. In spring, post-diapause beetles often fly a long distance from overwintering sites to potato fields. In summer and autumn, the flight ability is sharply reduced. Proline is the main energy substrate of L. decemlineata during flight and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) catalyzes the first step in proline catabolism. Here we identified a putative LdProDH gene; it had three cDNA isoforms which shared the same 5'UTR and coding region, but differed in the lengths of 3'UTRs (515, 1 092 and 1 242 bp for isoforms-1, -2 and -3, respectively). LdProDH encoded a 616 amino acid protein that showed high sequence similarity to ProDH-like proteins from other insect species. LdProDH was expressed in the third and fourth instars larvae and adults, but not in pupae. Dietary ingestion of bacterially expressed LdProDH-dsRNA by adults significantly decreased its messenger RNA (mRNA) level, and caused an elevation of free proline content in the hemolymph. Further observation revealed that three canonical polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were tandemly located in the 3'UTR of isoform-3. The first, second and third polyadenylation sites gave rise to isoforms-1, -2 and -3, respectively. Analysis of the genomic DNA uncovered that the three isoforms resulted from alternative polyadenylation. The mRNA level of isoform-1, which expressed at low levels in pre-diapause adults, became abundant in post-diapause beetles. It is indicated that the LdProDH expression is fine-tuned through 3'UTR to control proline catabolism for the season-dependent activity of L. decemlineata adults. "
negative,"Analysis of SSH library of rice variety Aganni reveals candidate gall midge resistance genes. The Asian rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae, is a serious insect pest causing extensive yield loss. Interaction between the gall midge and rice genotypes is known to be on a gene-for-gene basis. Here, we report molecular basis of HR- (hypersensitive reaction-negative) type of resistance in Aganni (an indica rice variety possessing gall midge resistance gene Gm8) through the construction and analysis of a suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA library. In all, 2,800 positive clones were sequenced and analyzed. The high-quality ESTs were assembled into 448 non-redundant gene sequences. Homology search with the NCBI databases, using BlastX and BlastN, revealed that 73% of the clones showed homology to genes with known function and majority of ESTs belonged to the gene ontology category 'biological process'. Validation of 27 putative candidate gall midge resistance genes through real-time PCR, following gall midge infestation, in contrasting parents and their derived pre-NILs (near isogenic lines) revealed induction of specific genes related to defense and metabolism. Interestingly, four genes, belonging to families of leucine-rich repeat (LRR), heat shock protein (HSP), pathogenesis related protein (PR), and NAC domain-containing protein, implicated in conferring HR+ type of resistance, were found to be up-regulated in Aganni. Two of the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI)-scavenging-enzyme-coding genes Cytosolic Ascorbate Peroxidase1, 2 (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2) were found up-regulated in Aganni in incompatible interaction possibly suppressing HR. We suggest that Aganni has a deviant form of inducible, salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance but without HR.  "
negative,"Aphid Transmission Alters the Genomic and Defective RNA Populations of Citrus tristeza virus Isolates. ABSTRACT A total of 14 Spanish isolates of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) and 1 isolate from Japan were transmitted by Aphis gossypii, and the subisolates obtained were compared with the source isolates for symptom expression and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) pattern. Of the 14 Spanish isolates, 9 showed altered dsRNA patterns after aphid transmission but only minor variations in the intensity of symptoms induced on Mexican lime. Northern blot hybridization with complementary DNA (cDNA) probes corresponding to both the 5' and the 3' termini of the CTV genomic RNA (gRNA) showed that the dsRNA bands that could be used to discriminate between the dsRNA pattern of the source and the aphid-transmitted isolates were the replicative forms of defective RNAs (D-RNAs). Conversely, the Japanese isolate and two subisolates obtained from it by aphid transmission had the same dsRNA pattern, but one of the subisolates induced milder symptoms in several hosts. Dot-blot hybridization with cDNA probes representing several regions of the gRNA showed that most of the aphid-transmitted isolates differed from the corresponding source isolate by their hybridization pattern. Our results indicate that aphid transmission often sorts the populations of gRNA variants and D-RNAs present in CTV isolates. "
positive,"Transcription factors CncC / Maf and AhR / ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GSTs conferring resistance to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in Spodoptera exigua. BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of multifunctional dimeric proteins existing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in the detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles, including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GST genes in insects are poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified at least three GST genes involved in resistance to the insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that three GSTs (SeGSTo2, SeGSTe6 and SeGSTd3) harbor the same cap 'n' collar C / muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (CncC / Maf) binding site, and SeGSTo2 and SeGSTe6 contain the aryl hydrocarbon receptor / aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (AhR / ARNT) binding site. Luciferase reporter assay showed co-transfection of reporter plasmid containing the SeGSTe6 promoter with CncC and / or Maf expressing constructs significantly boosted transcription. Similarly, AhR and / or ARNT expressing constructs also significantly increased the promoter activities. The co-transfection of mutated reporter plasmid with CncC / Maf or AhR / ARNT did not increase transcription activity anymore. Constitutive over-expression of CncC, Maf and AhR was also found in the HZ16 strain, which might be the molecular mechanism for up-regulated expression of multiple detoxification genes conferring resistance to insecticides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CncC / Maf and AhR / ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GST genes involved in insecticide resistance in Spodoptera exigua. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Copper-induced H2O2 accumulation confers larval tolerance to xanthotoxin by modulating CYP6B50 expression in Spodoptera litura. In the plant-insect arms race, plants synthesize toxic compounds to defend against herbivorous insects, whereas insects employ cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) to detoxify these phytotoxins. As ubiquitous environmental contaminants, heavy metals can be easily absorbed by plants and further accumulated in herbivorous insects through the food chains, resulting in tangible consequences for plant-insect interactions. However, whether heavy metals can influence P450 activities and thereby cause further effects on larval tolerance to phytotoxins remains unknown. In this study, we shown that prior exposure to copper (Cu) enhanced larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in Spodoptera litura, a major polyphagous pest of agriculture. P450 activities were induced in larvae exposed to Cu or xanthotoxin, and a midgut specific expressed P450 gene, CYP6B50 was cross-induced after exposure to these two toxic xenobiotics. Knocking down CYP6B50 by RNA interference (RNAi) rendered the larvae more sensitive to xanthotoxin. As defense against oxidative stress following metal exposure has been demonstrated to affect insecticide resistance, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed. Cu exposure caused the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in larval midgut. In addition, two antioxidant response elements (AREs) were identified from the CYP6B50 promoter, indicating that Cu-induced CYP6B50 expression may be related to the ROS burst. Application of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively suppressed CYP6B50 expression, inhibited P450 activities and impaired larval tolerance to xanthotoxin that had been induced by Cu. These results indicate that the increase in CYP6B50 expression regulated by Cu-induced H2O2 generation contributed to the enhancement of larval tolerance to xanthotoxin in S. litura. Ingestion of heavy metals from their host plants can inadvertently boost the counter-defense system of herbivorous insects to protect themselves against plant defensive toxins. "
positive,"A caspase-like decoy molecule enhances the activity of a paralogous caspase in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles in apoptosis and other key cellular processes. A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity. The discovery of potential caspase-like decoy molecules in several insect species opens new avenues for investigating caspase regulation in insects, particularly in disease vectors such as mosquitoes. "
positive,"The expression analysis of silk gland-enriched intermediate-size non-coding RNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori. Small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. Silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of Lepidopterous pests. We have previously identified 189 novel intermediate-size ncRNAs in silkworm Bombyx mori, including 40 ncRNAs that showed altered expression in different developmental stages. Here we characterized the functions of these 40 ncRNAs by measuring their expressions in six tissues of the fifth instar larvae using Northern blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. We identified nine ncRNAs (four small nucleolar RNAs and five unclassified ncRNAs) that were enriched in silk gland, including four ncRNAs that showed silk gland-specific expression. We further showed that three of nine silk gland-enriched ncRNAs were predominantly expressed in the anterior silk gland, whereas another three ncRNAs were highly accumulated in the posterior silk gland, suggesting that they may play different roles in fibroin synthesis. Furthermore, an unclassified ncRNA, Bm-152, exhibited converse expression pattern with its antisense host gene gartenzwerg in diverse tissues, and might regulate the expression of gartenzwerg through RNA-protein complex. In addition, two silk gland-enriched ncRNAs Bm-102 and Bm-159 can be found in histone modification complex, which indicated that they might play roles through epigenetic modifications. Taken together, we provided the first expression and preliminary functional analysis of silk gland-enriched ncRNAs, which will help understand the molecular mechanism of silk gland-development and fibroin synthesis.

negative,"Data for constructing insect genome content matrices for phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation. Twenty one fully sequenced and well annotated insect genomes were used to construct genome content matrices for phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation of insect genomes. To examine the role of e-value cutoff in ortholog determination we used scaled e-value cutoffs and a single linkage clustering approach.. The present communication includes (1) a list of the genomes used to construct the genome content phylogenetic matrices, (2) a nexus file with the data matrices used in phylogenetic analysis, (3) a nexus file with the Newick trees generated by phylogenetic analysis, (4) an excel file listing the Core (CORE) genes and Unique (UNI) genes found in five insect groups, and (5) a figure showing a plot of consistency index (CI) versus percent of unannotated genes that are apomorphies in the data set for gene losses and gains and bar plots of gains and losses for four consistency index (CI) cutoffs.

negative,"Screening and Functional Analyses of Nilaparvata lugens Salivary Proteome. Most phloem-feeding insects secrete gelling and watery saliva during the feeding process. However, the functions of salivary proteins are poorly understood. In this study, our purpose was to reveal the components and functions of saliva in a rice sap-sucking insect pest, Nilaparvata lugens. The accomplishment of the whole genome and transcriptome sequencing in N. lugens would be helpful for elucidating the gene information and expression specificity of the salivary proteins. In this study, we have, for the first time, identified the abundant protein components from gelling and watery saliva in a monophagous sap-sucking insect species through shotgun proteomic detection combined with the genomic and transcriptomic analysis. Eight unknown secreted proteins were limited to N. lugens, indicating species-specific saliva components. A group of annexin-like proteins first identified in the secreted saliva displayed different domain structure and expression specificity with typical insect annexins. Nineteen genes encoding five annexin-like proteins, six salivaps (salivary glands-specific proteins with unknown function), seven putative enzymes, and a mucin-like protein showed salivary gland-specific expression pattern, suggesting their importance in the physiological mechanisms of salivary gland and saliva in this insect species. RNA interference revealed that salivap-3 is a key protein factor in forming the salivary sheath, while annexin-like5 and carbonic anhydrase are indispensable for N. lugens survival. These novel findings will greatly help to clarify the detailed functions of salivary proteins in the physiological process of N. lugens and elucidate the interaction mechanisms between N. lugens and the rice plant, which could provide important targets for the future management of rice pests. "
positive,"Function and pharmacology of glutamate-gated chloride channel exon 9 splice variants from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) are found only in invertebrates and mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission. The structural and functional diversity of GluCls are produced through assembly of multiple subunits and via posttranscriptional alternations. Alternative splicing is the most common way to achieve this in insect GluCls and splicing occurs primarily at exons 3 and 9. As expression pattern and pharmacological properties of exon 9 alternative splices in invertebrate GluCls remain poorly understood, the cDNAs encoding three alternative splice variants (9a, 9b and 9c) of the PxGluCl gene from the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella were constructed and their pharmacological characterizations were examined using electrophysiological studies. Alternative splicing of exon 9 had little to no impact on PxGluCl sensitivity towards the agonist glutamate when subunits were singly or co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, the allosteric modulator abamectin and the chloride channel blocker fipronil had differing effects on PxGluCl splice variants. PxGluCl9c channels were more resistant to abamectin and PxGluCl9b channels were more sensitive to fipronil than other homomeric channels. In addition, heteromeric channels containing different splice variants showed similar sensitivity to abamectin (except for 9c) and reduced sensitivity to fipronil than homomeric channels. These findings suggest that functionally indistinguishable but pharmacologically distinct GluCls could be formed in P. xylostella and that the upregulated constitutive expression of the specific variants may contribute to the evolution of insecticide resistance in P. xylostella and other arthropods. "
negative,"Virus-independent and common transcriptome responses of leafhopper vectors feeding on maize infected with semi-persistently and persistent propagatively transmitted viruses. BACKGROUND: Insects are the most important epidemiological factors for plant virus disease spread, with >75% of viruses being dependent on insects for transmission to new hosts. The black-faced leafhopper (Graminella nigrifrons Forbes) transmits two viruses that use different strategies for transmission: Maize chlorotic dwarf virus (MCDV) which is semi-persistently transmitted and Maize fine streak virus (MFSV) which is persistently and propagatively transmitted. To date, little is known regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms in insects that regulate the process and efficiency of transmission, or how these mechanisms differ based on virus transmission strategy. RESULTS: RNA-Seq was used to examine transcript changes in leafhoppers after feeding on MCDV-infected, MFSV-infected and healthy maize for 4 h and 7 d. After sequencing cDNA libraries constructed from whole individuals using Illumina next generation sequencing, the Rnnotator pipeline in Galaxy was used to reassemble the G. nigrifrons transcriptome. Using differential expression analyses, we identified significant changes in transcript abundance in G. nigrifrons. In particular, transcripts implicated in the innate immune response and energy production were more highly expressed in insects fed on virus-infected maize. Leafhoppers fed on MFSV-infected maize also showed an induction of transcripts involved in hemocoel and cell-membrane linked immune responses within four hours of feeding. Patterns of transcript expression were validated for a subset of transcripts by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using RNA samples collected from insects fed on healthy or virus-infected maize for between a 4 h and seven week period. CONCLUSIONS: We expected, and found, changes in transcript expression in G. nigrifrons feeding of maize infected with a virus (MFSV) that also infects the leafhopper, including induction of immune responses in the hemocoel and at the cell membrane. The significant induction of the innate immune system in G. nigrifrons fed on a foregut-borne virus (MCDV) that does not infect leafhoppers was less expected. The changes in transcript accumulation that occur independent of the mode of pathogen transmission could be key for identifying insect factors that disrupt vector-mediated plant virus transmission. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification of cuticular protein genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Many kinds of cuticular proteins are found in a single insect species and their numbers and features are diversified among insects. Because there are so many cuticular proteins and so much sequence variation among them, an overview of cuticular protein gene is needed. Recently, a complete silkworm genome sequence was obtained through the integration of data from two whole genome sequence projects performed independently in 2004. To identify cuticular protein genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori exhaustively, we searched both the Bombyx whole genome sequence as well as various EST libraries, and found 220 putative cuticular protein genes. We also revised the annotation of the gene model, and named each identified cuticular protein based on its motif. The phylogenetic tree of cuticular protein genes among B. mori, Drosophila melanogaster, and Apis mellifera revealed that duplicate cuticular protein clusters have evolved independently among insects. Comparison of EST libraries and northern blot analyses showed that the tissue- and stage-specific expression of each gene was intricately regulated, even between adjacent genes in the same gene cluster. This study reveals many novel cuticular protein genes as well as insights into cuticular protein gene regulation. "
negative,"Insect-resistant biotech crops and their impacts on beneficial arthropods. With a projected population of 10 billion by 2050, an immediate priority for agriculture is to achieve increased crop yields in a sustainable and cost-effective way. The concept of using a transgenic approach was realized in the mid-1990s with the commercial introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops. By 2010, the global value of the seed alone was US $11.2 billion, with commercial biotech maize, soya bean grain and cotton valued at approximately US $150 billion. In recent years, it has become evident that insect-resistant crops expressing δ-endotoxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have made a significant beneficial impact on global agriculture, not least in terms of pest reduction and improved quality. However, because of the potential for pest populations to evolve resistance, and owing to lack of effective control of homopteran pests, alternative strategies are being developed. Some of these are based on Bacillus spp. or other insect pathogens, while others are based on the use of plant- and animal-derived genes. However, if such approaches are to play a useful role in crop protection, it is desirable that they do not have a negative impact on beneficial organisms at higher trophic levels thus affecting the functioning of the agro-ecosystem. This widely held concern over the ecological impacts of GM crops has led to the extensive examination of the potential effects of a range of transgene proteins on non-target and beneficial insects. The findings to date with respect to both commercial and experimental GM crops expressing anti-insect genes are discussed here, with particular emphasis on insect predators and parasitoids. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the plant bug Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae): Presently known as the smallest in Heteroptera. The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of the plant bug, Apolygus lucorum, an important cotton pest, has been sequenced and annotated in this study. The entire circular genome is 14 768 bp in size and represents the smallest in presently known heteropteran mt genomes. The mt genome is encoding for two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 13 protein coding genes and a control region, and the order, content, codon usage and base organization show similarity to a great extent to the hypothetical ancestral model. All protein coding genes use standard initiation codons ATN. Conventional stop codons TAA and TAG have been assigned to the most protein coding genes; however, COIII, ND4 and ND5 genes show incomplete terminator signal (T). All tRNA genes possess the typical clover leaf structure, but the dihydrouridine arm of tRNA(Ser(AGN)) only forms a simple loop. Secondary structure models of rRNA genes are generally in accordance with the former models, although some differences exist in certain parts. Three intergenic spacers have never been found in sequenced mt genomes of Heteroptera. The phylogenetic study based on protein coding genes is largely congruent with previous phylogenetic work. Both Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses highly support the sister relationship of A. lucorum and Lygus lineolaris, and Miridae presents a sister position to Anthocoridae. "
negative,"Comparative genomic analysis and evolution of family-B G protein-coupled receptors from six model insect species. Family-B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR-Bs) play vital roles in many biological processes, including growth, development and reproduction. However, the evolution and function of GPCR-Bs have been poorly understood in insects. We have identified 87 GPCR-Bs from six model insect species, 20 from Tribolium castaneum, 9 from Apis mellifera, 11 from Bombyx mori, 9 from Acyrthosiphon pisum, 14 from Anopheles gambiae and 24 from Drosophila melanogaster. 22 of them were reported in this study for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there are three kinds of evolutionary patterns that occurred among GPCR-Bs during insect evolution: one-to-one orthologous relationships, species-specific expansion and episodic duplication or loss in certain insect lineages. A striking finding was the discovery of a parathyroid hormone receptor like gene (pthrl) in invertebrates, which was independently duplicated in vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas this gene was lost at least twice during insect evolution. These results indicate that PTHRL is possibly divergent in the functions between mammals and insects. The information of family-B GPCRs in nondrosophiline insects has been established, and will promote the further study on the function of these GPCRs and deorphanization of them. On the other hand, this study provides us with multiple function of GPCR-Bs in differential organisms, which will be also the potential attacking targets for new pesticides and drugs. "
negative,"Structural cuticular proteins from arthropods: annotation, nomenclature, and sequence characteristics in the genomics era. The availability of whole genome sequences of several arthropods has provided new insights into structural cuticular proteins (CPs), in particular the distribution of different families, the recognition that these proteins may comprise almost 2% of the protein coding genes of some species, and the identification of features that should aid in the annotation of new genomes and EST libraries as they become available. Twelve CP families are described: CPR (named after the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus); CPF (named because it has a highly conserved region consisting of about forty-four amino acids); CPFL (like the CPFs in a conserved C-terminal region); the TWDL family, named after a picturesque phenotype of one mutant member; four families in addition to TWDL with a preponderance of low complexity sequence that are not member of the families listed above. These were named after particular diagnostic features as CPLCA, CPLCG, CPLCW, CPLCP. There are also CPG, a lepidopteran family with an abundance of glycines, the apidermin family, named after three proteins in Apis mellifera, and CPAP1 and CPAP3, named because they have features analogous to peritrophins, namely one or three chitin-binding domains. Also described are common motifs and features. Four unusual CPs are discussed in detail. Data that facilitated the analysis of sequence variation of single CP genes in natural populations are analyzed. "
positive,"UDP-Glycosyltransferases are involved in imidacloprid resistance in the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Lividae). UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), as phase II detoxification enzymes, are widely distributed within living organisms and play vital roles in the biotransformation of endobiotics and xenobiotics in insects. Insects increase the expression of detoxification enzymes to cope with the stress of xenobiotics, including insecticides. However, the roles of UGTs in insecticide resistance are still seldom reported. In this study, two UGT inhibitors, namely, 5-nitrouracil and sulfinpyrazone, were found to synergistically increase the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population of Diaphorina citri. Based on transcriptome data, a total of 17 putative UGTs were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that fourteen of the 17 UGT genes were overexpressed in the resistant population relative to the susceptible population. Using RNA interference technology to knockdown six UGT genes, the results suggested that silencing the selected UGT375A1, UGT383A1, UGT383B1, and UGT384A1 genes dramatically increased the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. However, silencing the UGT362B1 and UGT379A1 genes did not result in a significant increase in the toxicity of imidacloprid in the resistant population. These findings revealed that some upregulated UGT genes were involved in imidacloprid resistance in D. citri. These results shed some light upon and further our understanding of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance in insects. "
positive,"Feeding-based RNA interference of a trehalose phosphate synthase gene in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is the most devastating rice insect pest to have given rise to an outbreak in recent years. RNA interference (RNAi) is a technological breakthrough that has been developed as a powerful tool for studying gene function and for the highly targeted control of insect pests. Here, we examined the effects of using a feeding-based RNAi technique to target the gene trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS) in N. lugens. The full-length cDNA of N. lugens TPS (NlTPS) is 3235 bp and has an open reading frame of 2424 bp, encoding a protein of 807 amino acids. NlTPS was expressed in the fat body, midgut and ovary. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that NlTPS mRNA is expressed continuously with little change during the life of the insect. Efficient silencing of the TPS gene through double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) feeding led to rapid and significant reduction levels of TPS mRNA and enzymatic activity. Additionally, the development of N. lugens larvae that had been fed with the dsRNA was disturbed, resulting in lethality, and the cumulative survival rates dropped to 75.56, 64.44, 55.56 and 40.00% after continuous ingestion of 0.5 µg / µl dsRNA for 2, 4, 7 and 10 days, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those of the insects in the control group, suggesting that NlTPS dsRNA may be useful as a means of insect pest control. "
negative,"The last bastion? X chromosome genotyping of Anopheles gambiae species pair males from a hybrid zone reveals complex recombination within the major candidate 'genomic island of speciation'. Speciation with gene flow may be aided by reduced recombination helping to build linkage between genes involved in the early stages of reproductive isolation. Reduced recombination on chromosome X has been implicated in speciation within the Anopheles gambiae complex, species of which represent the major Afrotropical malaria vectors. The most recently diverged, morphologically indistinguishable, species pair, A. gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, ubiquitously displays a 'genomic island of divergence' spanning over 4 Mb from chromosome X centromere, which represents a particularly promising candidate region for reproductive isolation genes, in addition to containing the diagnostic markers used to distinguish the species. Very low recombination makes the island intractable for experimental recombination studies, but an extreme hybrid zone in Guinea Bissau offers the opportunity for natural investigation of X-island recombination. SNP analysis of chromosome X hemizygous males revealed: (i) strong divergence in the X-island despite a lack of autosomal divergence; (ii) individuals with multiple-recombinant genotypes, including likely double crossovers and localized gene conversion; (iii) recombination-driven discontinuity both within and between the molecular species markers, suggesting that the utility of the diagnostics is undermined under high hybridization. The largely, but incompletely protected nature of the X centromeric genomic island is consistent with a primary candidate area for accumulation of adaptive variants driving speciation with gene flow, while permitting some selective shuffling and removal of genetic variation. "
negative,"The mitochondrial control region of blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae): a hot spot for mitochondrial genome rearrangements. The family Calliphoridae consists of myiasis-causing flies, including species of economic, forensic, and medical importance. In this study, the complete control regions (CRs) of mitochondrial DNA from 15 calliphorid species were sequenced and structurally characterized. The CRs had a high content of adenines (A) and thymines (T) and varied in length from 854 to 2,018 bp, showing intraspecific variations in sequence and length. Two major domains were identified: the conserved domain containing conserved sequence blocks and cis-regulatory structures that may be related to the transcription and the origin of replication of mitochondrial DNA, and the variable domain, containing high sequence and length variation. Within the variable domain, duplication of the tRNA(Ile) gene, previously reported for three Chrysomya species, was identified in two more species of this genus and in two species of two other genera. The structural characterization shows the plasticity of the mitochondrial genome in dipterans. The organizational similarities of the duplicated region found in different species and the possible origin of the duplicated genes are discussed. "
negative,"Genomic inference accurately predicts the timing and severity of a recent bottleneck in a nonmodel insect population. The analysis of molecular data from natural populations has allowed researchers to answer diverse ecological questions that were previously intractable. In particular, ecologists are often interested in the demographic history of populations, information that is rarely available from historical records. Methods have been developed to infer demographic parameters from genomic data, but it is not well understood how inferred parameters compare to true population history or depend on aspects of experimental design. Here, we present and evaluate a method of SNP discovery using RNA sequencing and demographic inference using the program δaδi, which uses a diffusion approximation to the allele frequency spectrum to fit demographic models. We test these methods in a population of the checkerspot butterfly Euphydryas gillettii. This population was intentionally introduced to Gothic, Colorado in 1977 and has as experienced extreme fluctuations including bottlenecks of fewer than 25 adults, as documented by nearly annual field surveys. Using RNA sequencing of eight individuals from Colorado and eight individuals from a native population in Wyoming, we generate the first genomic resources for this system. While demographic inference is commonly used to examine ancient demography, our study demonstrates that our inexpensive, all-in-one approach to marker discovery and genotyping provides sufficient data to accurately infer the timing of a recent bottleneck. This demographic scenario is relevant for many species of conservation concern, few of which have sequenced genomes. Our results are remarkably insensitive to sample size or number of genomic markers, which has important implications for applying this method to other nonmodel systems.  "
negative,"The piggyBac transposon mediates germ-line transformation in the Oriental fruit fly and closely related elements exist in its genome. Germ-line transformation of a white eye strain of the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, was achieved with the piggyBac vector, derived from a transposon originally isolated from the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni. The vector was marked with the medfly white+ gene cDNA, and three transgenic lines were identified at a frequency of approximately 2% per fertile G0. Vector integrations were verified by Southern DNA hybridization, which also revealed the presence of endogenous genomic elements closely related to piggyBac. Approximately 10-20 elements per genome were evident in several B. dorsalis strains, and sequence analysis of 1.5 kb gene amplification products from two wild strains and the white eye host strain indicated 95% nucleotide and 92% amino acid sequence identity among resident elements and the T. ni element. PiggyBac was not evident by hybridization in other tephritid species, or insects previously transformed with the transposon. This is the first discovery of piggyBac beyond T. ni, and its existence in a distantly related species has important implications for the practical use of the vector and insects transformed with it. "
negative,"Genome-wide annotation and comparative analysis of cuticular protein genes in the noctuid pest Spodoptera litura. Insect cuticle is considered an adaptable and versatile building material with roles in the construction and function of exoskeleton. Its physical properties are varied, as the biological requirements differ among diverse structures and change during the life cycle of the insect. Although the bulk of cuticle consists basically of cuticular proteins (CPs) associated with chitin, the degree of cuticular sclerotization is an important factor in determining its physical properties. Spodoptera litura, the tobacco cutworm, is an important agricultural pest in Asia. Compared to the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori, another lepidopteran whose CP genes have been well annotated, S. litura has a shorter life cycle, hides in soil during daytime beginning in the 5th instar and is exposed to soil in the pupal stage without the protection of a cocoon. In order to understand how the CP genes may have been adapted to support the characteristic life style of S. litura, we searched its genome and found 287 putative cuticular proteins that can be classified into 9 CP families (CPR with three groups (RR-1, RR-2, RR-3), CPAP1, CPAP3, CPF, CPFL, CPT, CPG, CPCFC and CPLCA), and a collection of unclassified CPs named CPH. There were also 112 cuticular proteins enriched in Histidine residues with content varying from 6% to 30%, comprising many more His-rich cuticular proteins than B. mori. A phylogenetic analysis between S. litura, M. sexta and B. mori uncovered large expansions of RR-1 and RR-2 CPs, forming large gene clusters in different regions of S. litura chromosome 9. We used RNA-seq analysis to document the expression profiles of CPs in different developmental stages and tissues of S. litura. The comparative genomic analysis of CPs between S. litura and B. mori integrated with the unique behavior and life cycle of the two species offers new insights into their contrasting ecological adaptations.

negative,"Cloning and rescue of the genome of Bombyx mori bidensovirus, and characterization of a recombinant virus. BACKGROUND: Bombyx mori bidensovirus (BmBDV), which belongs to the Bidnaviridae family established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2011, was the first bidensovirus identified in insects. The structure of BmBDV is similar to that of parvoviruses, while its replication is similar to that of adenoviruses. Although BmBDV has the potential to be used as a tool in biological pest control and as an expression vector, virus rescue has been a bottleneck in the application of this virus. METHODS: In this study, we constructed a full-length genomic clone of BmBDV and showed that its terminal structure was restored. A recombinant BmBDV that expressed the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was constructed. Then, BmN cells, which are an ovarian cell line, were co-transfected with the linearized genome using continuous culture and expanded cell culture methods. RESULTS: The results showed that the GFP gene was expressed successfully, and that cell lesions occurred in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, typical densonucleosis viruses were observed in reinfected silkworm larvae and larval midgut tissues infected by BmBDV, as evidenced by the emission of green fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that the virus could be rescued from the infected BmN cells after co-transfection with the linear full length virus genome. "
positive,"The function of spineless in antenna and wing development of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. A wide array of sensilla are distributed on insect antennae, and they play a variety of important roles. Rice planthoppers, destructive pests on rice, have a unique antenna sensilla structure called the 'sensory plaque organ'. The spineless (ss) gene encodes a bHLH-PAS transcription factor and plays a key role in antenna development. In the current study, a 3029 bp full-length cDNA of the Nilaparvata lugens ss gene (Nlss) was cloned, and it encodes 654 amino acid residues. The highest level of Nlss expression was detected in the thorax of fourth-instar nymphs. Knockdown of Nlss in nymphs led to a decrease in the number and size of plaque organs. Moreover, the flagella of the treated insects were poorly developed, wilted, and even dropped off from the pedicel. Nlss-knockdown also resulted in twisted wings in both long-winged and short-winged brown planthoppers. Y-type olfactometer analyses indicated that antenna defects originating from Nlss depletion resulted in less sensitivity to host volatiles. This study represents the first report of the characteristics and functions of Nlss in N. lugens antenna and wing development and illuminates the function of the plaque organ of N. lugens in host volatile perception. "
negative,"CRISPR / Cas9 mediated genome editing of Helicoverpa armigera with mutations of an ABC transporter gene HaABCA2 confers resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry2A toxins. High levels of resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab have been identified to be genetically linked with loss of function mutations of an ABC transporter gene (ABCA2) in two lepidopteran insects, Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa punctigera. To further confirm the causal relationship between the ABCA2 gene (HaABCA2) and Cry2Ab resistance in H. armigera, two HaABCA2 knockout strains were created from the susceptible SCD strain with the CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing system. One strain (SCD-A2KO1) is homozygous for a 2-bp deletion in exon 2 of HaABCA2 created by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The other strain (SCD-A2KO2) is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 18 of HaABCA2 made by homology-directed repair (HDR), which was produced to mimic the r2 resistance allele of a field-derived Cry2Ab-resistant strain from Australia. Both knockout strains obtained high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa (>120-fold) and Cry2Ab (>100-fold) compared with the original SCD strain, but no or very limited resistance to Cry1Ac (<4-fold). Resistance to Cry2Ab in both knockouts is recessive, and genetic complementary tests confirmed Cry2Ab resistance alleles are at the same locus (i.e. HaABCA2) for the two strains. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of midguts from both knockout strains lost binding with Cry2Ab, but maintained the same binding with Cry1Ac as the SCD strain. In vivo functional evidence from this study demonstrates knockout of HaABCA2 confers high levels of resistance to both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab, confirming that HaABCA2 plays a key role in mediating toxicity of both Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab against H. armigera.

negative,"Genes and genomic processes underpinning the social lives of ants. The >15000 ant species are all highly social and show great variation in colony organization, complexity and behavior. The mechanisms by which such sociality evolved, as well as those underpinning the elaboration of ant societies since their ∼140 million year old common ancestor, have long been pondered. Here, we review recent insights generated using various genomic approaches. This includes understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying caste differentiation and the diversity of social structures, studying the impact of eusociality on genomic evolutionary rates, and investigating gene expression changes associated with differences in lifespan between castes. Furthermore, functional studies involving RNAi and CRISPR have recently been successfully applied to ants, opening the door to exciting research that promises to revolutionize the understanding of the evolution and diversification of social living.

positive,"RNA Interference in the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, Using Plastid-Encoded Long Double-Stranded RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising method for controlling pest insects by silencing the expression of vital insect genes to interfere with development and physiology; however, certain insect Orders are resistant to this process. In this study, we set out to test the ability of in planta-expressed dsRNA synthesized within the plastids to silence gene expression in an insect recalcitrant to RNAi, the lepidopteran species, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). Using the Manduca vacuolar-type H+ ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) gene as the target, we first evaluated RNAi efficiency of two dsRNA products of different lengths by directly feeding the in vitro-synthesized dsRNAs to M. sexta larvae. We found that a long dsRNA of 2222 bp was the most effective in inducing lethality and silencing the v-ATPaseA gene, when delivered orally in a water droplet. We further transformed the plastid genome of the M. sexta host plant, Nicotiana tabacum, to produce this long dsRNA in its plastids and performed bioassays with M. sexta larvae on the transplastomic plants. In the tested insects, the plastid-derived dsRNA had no effect on larval survival and no statistically significant effect on expression of the v-ATPaseA gene was observed. Comparison of the absolute quantities of the dsRNA present in transplastomic leaf tissue for v-ATPaseA and a control gene, GFP, of a shorter size, revealed a lower concentration for the long dsRNA product compared to the short control product. We suggest that stability and length of the dsRNA may have influenced the quantities produced in the plastids, resulting in inefficient RNAi in the tested insects. Our results imply that many factors dictate the effectiveness of in planta RNAi, including a likely trade-off effect as increasing the dsRNA product length may be countered by a reduction in the amount of dsRNA produced and accumulated in the plastids. "
negative,"Characterization of the complete genome segments from BmCPV-SZ, a novel  Bombyx mori  cypovirus 1 isolate. A novel Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 isolated from infected silkworm larvae and tentatively assigned as Bombyx mori cypovirus 1 isolate Suzhou (BmCPV-SZ). The complete nucleotide sequences of genomic segments S1-S10 from BmCPV-SZ were determined. All segments possessed a single open reading frame; however, bioinformatic evidence suggested a short overlapping coding sequence in S1. Each BmCPV-SZ segment possessed the conserved terminal sequences AGUAA and GUUAGCC at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The conserved A / G at the -3 position in relation to the AUG codon could be found in the BmCPV-SZ genome, and it was postulated that this conserved A / G may be the most important nucleotide for efficient translation initiation in cypoviruses (CPVs). Examination of the putative amino acid sequences encoded by BmCPV-SZ revealed some characteristic motifs. Homology searches showed that viral structural proteins VP1, VP3, and VP4 had localized homologies with proteins of Rice ragged stunt virus , a member of the genus Oryzavirus within the family Reoviridae. A phylogenetic tree based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences demonstrated that CPV is more closely related to Rice ragged stunt virus and Aedes pseudoscutellaris reovirus than to other members of Reoviridae, suggesting that they may have originated from common ancestors. "
negative,"From the Cover: Directed, efficient, and versatile modifications of the Drosophila genome by genomic engineering. With the completion of genome sequences of major model organisms, increasingly sophisticated genetic tools are necessary for investigating the complex and coordinated functions of genes. Here we describe a genetic manipulation system termed ""genomic engineering"" in Drosophila. Genomic engineering is a 2-step process that combines the ends-out (replacement) gene targeting with phage integrase phiC31-mediated DNA integration. First, through an improved and modified gene targeting method, a founder knock-out line is generated by deleting the target gene and replacing it with an integration site of phiC31. Second, DNA integration by phiC31 is used to reintroduce modified target-gene DNA into the native locus in the founder knock-out line. Genomic engineering permits directed and highly efficient modifications of a chosen genomic locus into virtually any desired mutant allele. We have successfully applied the genomic engineering scheme on 6 different genes and have generated at their loci more than 70 unique alleles. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers from the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata: cross-species amplification in other Tephritidae species reveals a varying degree of transferability. The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is a pest of major economic importance and has become a model for the development of SIT control programs for insect pests. Significant information has been accumulated on classical and population genetics of this species during the past 2 decades. However, the availability of molecular markers is limited. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of 159 microsatellite clones and the development of 108 polymorphic microsatellite markers for this insect pest. Mapping by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of 21 microsatellite clones enriched the cytogenetic map that was previously constructed by our group. The enriched map provides a large number of STSs for future genome mapping projects. Cross-species amplification of these microsatellite loci in 12 Tephritidae species and sequence analysis of several amplification products indicated a varying degree of transferability and their possible usefulness as molecular and genetic markers in these species where genetic and molecular tools are limited. "
negative,"The genome sequence of a novel RNA virus in Adelphocoris suturalis. The complete genome of a novel virus found in Adelphocoris suturalis was determined by RNA-seq and named Adelphocoris suturalis-associated virus 1 (ASV1). ASV1 has a single-stranded RNA genome of 10,845 nucleotides in length and contains five putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a polypeptide of 2592 amino acids (aa) and contains four conserved domains: a viral RNA methyltransferase domain, an FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain, a viral RNA helicase domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 encode polypeptides of 190, 461, 103 and 159 aa, respectively, of which only ORF5 contains a conserved domain, the Tobacco mosaic virus-coat superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis with the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that ASV1 clusters with the Drosophila-related Boutonnet virus. The similar genomic structure and high bootstrap value identified in the maximum-likelihood tree suggest that ASV1 (possibly alongside Boutonnet virus) could be considered the prototype of a new taxon of unclassified insect viruses. The prevalence of ASV1 infection in wild populations of A. suturalis was at a low level (6.60%, 14 positives from 212 samples). "
negative,"Distribution of Anopheles daciae and other Anopheles maculipennis complex species in Serbia. Malaria is one of the most severe health problems facing the world today. Until the mid-twentieth century, Europe was an endemic area of malaria, with the Balkan countries being heavily infested. Sibling species belonging to the Anopheles maculipennis complex are well-known as effective vectors of Plasmodium in Europe. A vast number of human malaria cases in the past in the former Yugoslavia territory have stressed the significance of An. maculipennis complex species as primary and secondary vectors. Therefore, the present study evaluates the species composition, geographic distribution and abundance of these malaria vector species. Mosquitoes were collected in the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina and analysed by PCR-RFLP, multiplex PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 intron of genomic rDNA. Four sibling species of the An. maculipennis complex were identified. Both larvae and adults of the recently described species An. daciae were identified for the first time in Serbia. In 250 larval samples, 109 (44%) An. messeae, 90 (36%) An. maculipennis s.s., 33 (13%) An. daciae and 18 (7%) An. atroparvus were identified. In adult collections, 81 (47%) An. messeae, 55 (32%) An. daciae, 33 (19%) An. maculipennis s.s., and 3 (2%) An. atroparvus were recorded. The most abundant species in Vojvodina was An. messeae, whereas An. atroparvus was confirmed a rare species in all parts. Since this species is a potentially, highly competent malarial vector, low population density could be crucial to prevent a new establishment of endemic malaria transmission in Serbia. "
positive,"Wing defects in Drosophila xenicid mutant clones are caused by C-terminal deletion of additional sex combs (Asx). BACKGROUND: The coordinated action of genes that control patterning, cell fate determination, cell size, and cell adhesion is required for proper wing formation in Drosophila. Defects in any of these basic processes can lead to wing aberrations, including blisters. The xenicid mutation was originally identified in a screen designed to uncover regulators of adhesion between wing surfaces [1]. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrate that expression of the betaPS integrin or the patterning protein Engrailed are not affected in developing wing imaginal discs in xenicid mutants. Instead, expression of the homeotic protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is strongly increased in xenicid mutant cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of Ubx transforms cells from a wing blade fate to a haltere fate, and that the presence of haltere cells within the wing blade is the primary defect leading to the adult wing phenotypes observed. "
negative,"De novo transcriptome analysis and highly sensitive digital gene expression profiling of Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) pupae using MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). Determining a post-mortem interval using the weight or length of blow fly larvae to calculate the insect's age is well established. However, to date, there are only a handful studies dealing with age estimation of blow fly pupae, in which weight or length cannot be used as a relevant parameter. The analysis of genetic markers, which indicate a certain developmental stage, can extend the period for a successful post-mortem interval determination. In order to break new ground in the field of age determination of forensic relevant blow flies, we performed a de novo transcriptome analysis of Calliphora vicina pupae at 15 different developmental stages. Obtained data serve as base to establish molecular age determination techniques. We used a new, deeper, and more cost-effective digital gene expression profiling method called MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). We generated 15 libraries out of 15 developmental stages, with 3-8 million reads per library. In total, 53,539 distinct transcripts were detected, and 7548 were annotated to known insect genes. The analysis provides high-resolution gene expression profiles of all covered transcripts, which were used to identify differentially expressed genetic markers as candidates for a molecular age estimation of C. vicina pupae. Moreover, the analysis allows insights into gene activity of pupal development and the relationship between different genes interesting for insect development in general.  "
negative,"Expression of heterologous promoters in Lutzomyia longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae) cell lines. To establish a transient expression system for genes introduced into sand fly cell lines, we tested the expression of the luciferase reporter gene under control of different promoters. Towards this end, we lipofected cell lines obtained from New and Old World sand flies, LL-5 from Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Neiva and PP-9 from Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli, respectively. The relative levels of luciferase expression were studied under control of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), human cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40 or Junonia coenia (Hübner) densovirus (P9) promoters. The Drosophila heat shock protein 70 promoter, originating from insect genes, functioned as a strong promoter in both cell lines. Promoters from the different virus genes also were capable of driving transgene expression in both cell lines. "
negative,"Tangible benefits of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genome sequencing for aphid proteomics: Enhancements in protein identification and data validation for homology-based proteomics. Homology-driven proteomics promises to reveal functional biology in insects with sparse genome sequence information. A proteomics study comparing plant virus transmission competent and refractive genotypes of the aphid Schizaphis graminum isolated numerous candidate proteins involved in virus transmission, but limited genome sequence information hampered their identification. The complete genome of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, released in 2008, enabled us to double the number of protein identifications beyond what was possible using available EST libraries and other insect sequences. This was concomitant with a dramatic increase of the number of MS and MS / MS peptide spectra matching the genome-derived protein sequence. LC-MS / MS proved to be the most robust method of peptide detection. Cross-matching spectral data to multiple EST sequences and error tolerant searching to identify amino acid substitutions enhanced the percent coverage of the Schizaphis graminum proteins. 2-D electrophoresis provided the protein pI and MW which enabled the refinement of the candidate protein selection and provided a measure of protein abundance when coupled to the spectral data. Thus, the homology-based proteomics pipeline for insects should include efforts to maximize the number of peptide matches to the protein to increase certainty in protein identification and relative protein abundance. "
negative,"DEC: a new miniature inverted-repeat transposable element from the genome of the beetle Tenebrio molitor. In this paper we describe a novel family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), named DEC, isolated from the genome of the beetle Tenebrio molitor. These elements are highly reiterated and their number is estimated to be around 3500 per haploid genome. Two of them have been isolated and the two sequences are 84% identical. Like other MITEs, they are characterized by their small size, their A + T richness, the presence of terminal inverted repeats and the absence of open reading frames. These data suggest that MITEs are probably widely distributed in arthropods. "
positive,"Hydrocarbons catalysed by TmCYP4G122 and TmCYP4G123 in Tenebrio molitor modulate the olfactory response of the parasitoid Scleroderma guani. Hydrocarbons (HCs) present on the epicuticle of terrestrial insects are not only used to reduce water loss but are also used as chemical signals. The cytochrome p450 CYP4G gene is essential for HC biosynthesis in some insects. However, its function in Tenebrio molitor is unknown. Moreover, it is not yet known whether CYP4G of a host can modulate the searching behaviours of its parasitoid. Here, we explore the function of the TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 genes in T. molitor. The TmCYP4G122 and CYP4G123 transcripts could be detected in all developmental stages. Their expression was higher in the fat body and abdominal cuticle than in the gut. Their transcript levels in mature larvae under desiccation stress [relative humidity (RH) < 5%] was significantly higher than that in the control (RH = 70%). Injection of dsCYP4G122 and dsCYP4G123 caused a reduction in HC biosynthesis and was associated with increased susceptibility to desiccation. Individuals of the parasitoid Scleroderma guani that emerged from mealworm pupae showed host preference for normal pupae whereas S. guani that emerged from pupae lacking CYP4G122 or / and CYP4G123 lost this searching preference. The current results confirm that CYP4G122 and CYP4G123 regulate the biosynthesis of HCs and modulate the olfactory response of its parasitoid S. guani. "
positive,"Native subunit composition of two insect nicotinic receptor subtypes with differing affinities for the insecticide imidacloprid. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively to control a variety of insect pest species. The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), an insect pest of rice crops throughout Asia, is an important target species for control with neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid. Studies with nAChRs purified from N. lugens have identified two [(3)H]imidacloprid binding sites with different affinities (K(d) = 3.5 + / - 0.6 pM and 1.5 + / - 0.2 nM). Co-immunoprecipitation studies with native preparations of N. lugens nAChRs, using subunit-selective antisera, have demonstrated the co-assembly of Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 subunits into one receptor complex and of Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 into another. Immunodepletion of Nlalpha1 or Nlalpha2 subunits resulted in the selective loss of the lower affinity imidacloprid binding site, whereas immunodepletion of Nlalpha3 or Nlalpha8 caused the selective loss of the high-affinity site. Immunodepletion of Nlbeta1 resulted in a complete absence of specific imidacloprid binding. In contrast, immunodepletion with antibodies selective for other N. lugens nAChR subunits (Nlalpha4, Nlalpha6, Nlalpha7 and Nlbeta2) had no significant effect on imidacloprid binding. Taken together, these data suggest that nAChRs containing Nlalpha1, Nlalpha2 and Nlbeta1 constitute the lower affinity binding site, whereas nAChRs containing Nlalpha3, Nlalpha8 and Nlbeta1 constitute the higher affinity binding site for imidacloprid in N. lugens. "
positive,"An adenylyl cyclase like-9 gene (NlAC9) influences growth and fecundity in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The cAMP / PKA intracellular signaling pathway is launched by adenylyl cyclase (AC) conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent activation of PKA. Although this pathway is very well known in insect physiology, there is little to no information on it in some very small pest insects, such as the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål. BPH is a destructive pest responsible for tremendous crop losses in rice cropping systems. We are investigating the potentials of novel pest management technologies from RNA interference perspective. Based on analysis of transcriptomic data, the BPH AC like-9 gene (NlAC9) was up-regulated in post-mating females, which led us to pose the hypothesis that NlAC9 is a target gene that would lead to reduced BPH fitness and populations. Targeting NlAC9 led to substantially decreased soluble ovarian protein content, yeast-like symbiont abundance, and vitellogenin gene expression, accompanied with stunted ovarian development and body size. Eggs laid were decreased and oviposition period shortened. Taken together, our findings indicated that NlAC9 exerted pronounced effects on female fecundity, growth and longevity, which strongly supports our hypothesis. "
positive,"Large gene family expansions and adaptive evolution for odorant and gustatory receptors in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Gaining insight into the mechanisms of chemoreception in aphids is of primary importance for both integrative studies on the evolution of host plant specialization and applied research in pest control management because aphids rely on their sense of smell and taste to locate and assess their host plants. We made use of the recent genome sequence of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, to address the molecular characterization and evolution of key molecular components of chemoreception: the odorant (Or) and gustatory (Gr) receptor genes. We identified 79 Or and 77 Gr genes in the pea aphid genome and showed that most of them are aphid-specific genes that have undergone recent and rapid expansion in the genome. By addressing selection within sets of paralogous Or and Gr expansions, for the first time in an insect species, we show that the most recently duplicated loci have evolved under positive selection, which might be related to the high degree of ecological specialization of this species. Although more functional studies are still needed for insect chemoreceptors, we provide evidence that Grs and Ors have different sets of positively selected sites, suggesting the possibility that these two gene families might have different binding pockets and bind structurally distinct classes of ligand. The pea aphid is the most basal insect species with a completely sequenced genome to date. The identification of chemoreceptor genes in this species is a key step toward further exploring insect comparative genetics, the genomics of ecological specialization and speciation, and new pest control strategies. "
negative,"Development and evolution of brain allometry in wasps (Vespidae): size, ecology and sociality. We review research on brain development and brain evolution in the wasp family Vespidae. Basic vespid neuroanatomy and some aspects of functional neural circuitry are well-characterized, and genomic tools for exploring brain plasticity are being developed. Although relatively modest in terms of species richness, the Vespidae include species spanning much of the known range of animal social complexity, from solitary nesters to highly eusocial species with some of the largest known colonies and multiple reproductives. Eusocial species differ in behavior and ecology including variation in queen / worker caste differentiation and in diurnal / nocturnal activity. Species differences in overall brain size are strongly associated with brain allometry; relative sizes of visual processing tissues increase at faster rates than antennal processing tissues. The lower relative size of the central-processing mushroom bodies (MB) in eusocial species compared to solitary relatives suggests sociality may relax demands on individual cognitive abilities. However, queens have greater relative MB volumes than their workers, and MB development is positively associated with social dominance status in some species. Fruitful areas for future investigations of adaptive brain investment in the clade include sampling of key overlooked taxa with diverse social structures, and the analysis of neural correlations with ecological divergence in foraging resources and diel activity patterns. "
negative,"Microsatellite loci are not abundant in all arthropod genomes: analyses in the hard tick, Ixodes scapularis and the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Plasmid libraries enriched for microsatellites were generated in the tick, Ixodes scapularis and in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Libraries were enriched for genomic DNA containing (AC)n, (AG)n, (ATG)n, (CAG)n, (TAG)n, (AAT)n, (CTGY)n or (GATA)n motifs. Clones containing each motif were sequenced in both species for PCR primer design. In I. scapularis, most primers amplified a single locus and alleles varied in the number of microsatellite repeats and segregated as codominant markers. In contrast (AC)n, (TAG)n and (GATA)n microsatellite loci extracted from Ae. aegypti appeared to be members of multigene families. A primer pair designed to amplify a particular TAG locus instead amplified many independently segregating loci, some of which did not contain TAG microsatellites. Alleles at the TAG loci segregated as dominant markers and there was limited evidence for length variation among alleles. These results suggest that microsatellite loci are not universally abundant in arthropod genomes nor do alleles always segregate as codominant markers. "
positive,"Characterization of two copper / zinc superoxide dismutases (Cu / Zn-SODs) from the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis and their activities in protecting E. coli cells against cold. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are crucial in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, studies regarding SOD functions in insects under cold conditions are rare. In this paper, two novel Cu / Zn-SOD genes in the desert beetle Microdera punctipennis, an extracellular copper / zinc SOD (MpecCu / Zn-SOD) and an intracellular copper / zinc SOD (MpicCu / Zn-SOD), were identified and characterized. The results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that MpecCu / Zn-SOD expression was significantly up-regulated by 4 °C exposure for 0.5 h, but MpicCu / Zn-SOD was not. Superoxide anion radical (O2•-) content in beetles under 4 °C exposure for 0.5 h showed an initial sharp increase and fluctuated during the cold treatment period, which was consistent with the relative mRNA level of MpecCu / Zn-SOD. The total SOD activity in the beetle was negatively correlated to the O2•- content with a correlation coefficient of -0.437. An E. coli system was employed to study the function of each MpCu / Zn-SOD gene. The fusion proteins Trx-His-MpCu / Zn-SODs were over expressed in E. coli BL21 using pET32a vector, and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The transformed bacteria BL21(pET32a-MpecCu / Zn-SOD) and BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD) showed increased cold tolerance to -4 °C as well as increased SOD activity compared to the control BL21(pET32a). The relative conductivity and malondialdehyde content in the two MpCu / Zn-SODs transformed bacteria under -4 °C were significantly lower than the control BL21(pET32a). Furthermore, BL21(pET32a-MpecCu / Zn-SOD) had significantly higher SOD activity and cold tolerance than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD) under -4 °C treatment, and had lower conductivity than BL21(pET32a-MpicCu / Zn-SOD). In conclusion, low temperature led to the accumulation of O2•- in M. punctipennis, which stimulated the expression of extracellular MpCu / Zn-SOD gene and the increase of total SOD activity. E. coli overexpressing Trx-His-MpCu / Zn-SODs increased resistance to cold treatment-induced oxidative stress. Our findings will be helpful in further study of Cu / Zn-SOD genes in insect cold-tolerance. "
negative,"Genomic innovations, transcriptional plasticity and gene loss underlying the evolution and divergence of two highly polyphagous and invasive Helicoverpa pest species. BACKGROUND: Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea are major caterpillar pests of Old and New World agriculture, respectively. Both, particularly H. armigera, are extremely polyphagous, and H. armigera has developed resistance to many insecticides. Here we use comparative genomics, transcriptomics and resequencing to elucidate the genetic basis for their properties as pests. RESULTS: We find that, prior to their divergence about 1.5 Mya, the H. armigera / H. zea lineage had accumulated up to more than 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra gustatory receptor genes, compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges. The two genomes remain very similar in gene content and order, but H. armigera is more polymorphic overall, and H. zea has lost several detoxification genes, as well as about 50 gustatory receptor genes. It also lacks certain genes and alleles conferring insecticide resistance found in H. armigera. Non-synonymous sites in the expanded gene families above are rapidly diverging, both between paralogues and between orthologues in the two species. Whole genome transcriptomic analyses of H. armigera larvae show widely divergent responses to different host plants, including responses among many of the duplicated detoxification and digestion genes. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme polyphagy of the two heliothines is associated with extensive amplification and neofunctionalisation of genes involved in host finding and use, coupled with versatile transcriptional responses on different hosts. H. armigera's invasion of the Americas in recent years means that hybridisation could generate populations that are both locally adapted and insecticide resistant. "
negative,"Production of human type II collagen using an efficient baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system. Human type II collagen is a macromolecular protein found throughout the human body. The baculovirus expression vector system is one of the most ideal systems for the routine production and display of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in insect, larvae, and mammalian cells. We use this system to express a full-length gene, human type II collagen cDNA (4257 bp), in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells (Sf9), Bombyx mori cells, and silkworm larvae. In this study, the expression of human type II collagen gene in both insect cells and silkworm larvae was purified by nickel column chromatography, leading to 300-kDa bands in SDS-PAGE and western blotting indicative of collagen α-chains organized in a triple-helical structure. About 1 mg / larva human type II collagen is purified from silkworm skin, which shows a putative large scale of collagen production way. An activity assay of recombinant human type II collagen expressed by silkworm larvae demonstrated that the recombinant protein has considerable bioactive properties. Scanning electron microscopy of purified proteins clearly reveals randomly distributed and pitted structures. We conclude that the baculovirus-silkworm multigene expression system can be used as an efficient platform for express active human type II collagen and other complicated eukaryotic proteins. "
positive,"WSV181 inhibits JAK / STAT signaling and promotes viral replication in Drosophila. The Janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK / STAT) pathway plays a critical role in host defense against viral infections. Here, we report the use of the Drosophila model system to investigate the modulation of the JAK / STAT pathway by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) protein WSV181. WSV181 overexpression in transgenic flies resulted in the downregulation of STAT92E and STAT92E-targeted genes. This result indicates that WSV181 can suppress JAK / STAT signaling by controlling STAT92E expression. An infection experiment was carried out on transgenic Drosophila infected with Drosophila C virus and on Litopenaeus vannamei injected with recombinant WSV181 and WSSV. The increased viral load and suppressed transcript levels of JAK / STAT pathway components indicate that WSV181 can promote viral proliferation by inhibiting the JAK / STAT pathway. This study provided evidence for the role of WSV181 in viral replication and revealed a new mechanism through which WSSV evades host immunity to maintain persistent infection. "
negative,"Genomic imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both mammalian and insect imprinting. Genomic imprinting is a process that marks DNA, causing a change in gene or chromosome behavior, depending on the sex of the transmitting parent. In mammals, most examples of genomic imprinting affect the transcription of individual or small clusters of genes whereas in insects, genomic imprinting tends to silence entire chromosomes. This has been interpreted as evidence of independent evolutionary origins for imprinting. To investigate how these types of imprinting are related, we performed a phenotypic, molecular, and cytological analysis of an imprinted chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of this chromosome reveals that the imprint results in transcriptional silencing. Yet, the domain of transcriptional silencing is very large, extending at least 1.2 Mb and encompassing over 100 genes, and is associated with decreased somatic polytenization of the entire chromosome. We propose that repression of somatic replication in polytenized cells, as a secondary response to the imprint, acts to extend the size of the imprinted domain to an entire chromosome. Thus, imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both typical mammalian and insect imprinting which suggests that genomic imprinting in Drosophila and mammals is not fundamentally different; imprinting is manifest as transcriptional silencing of a few genes or silencing of an entire chromosome depending on secondary processes such as differences in gene density and polytenization.

negative,"Insect genome content phylogeny and functional annotation of core insect genomes. Twenty-one fully sequenced and well annotated insect genomes were examined for genome content in a phylogenetic context. Gene presence / absence matrices and phylogenetic trees were constructed using several phylogenetic criteria. The role of e-value on phylogenetic analysis and genome content characterization is examined using scaled e-value cutoffs and a single linkage clustering approach to orthology determination. Previous studies have focused on the role of gene loss in terminals in the insect tree of life. The present study examines several common ancestral nodes in the insect tree. We suggest that the common ancestors of major insect groups like Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Holometabola experience more gene gain than gene loss. This suggests that as major insect groups arose, their genomic repertoire expanded through gene duplication (segmental duplications), followed by contraction by gene loss in specific terminal lineages. In addition, we examine the functional significance of the loss and gain of genes in the divergence of some of the major insect groups.  "
negative,"The genome sequence of pepper vein yellows virus (family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus). The complete genome of pepper vein yellows virus (PeVYV) was sequenced using random amplification of RNA samples isolated from vector insects (Aphis gossypii) that had been given access to PeVYV-infected plants. The PeVYV genome consisted of 6244 nucleotides and had a genomic organization characteristic of members of the genus Polerovirus. PeVYV had highest amino acid sequence identities in ORF0 to ORF3 (75.9 - 91.9%) with tobacco vein distorting polerovirus, with which it was only 25.1% identical in ORF5. These sequence comparisons and previously studied biological properties indicate that PeVYV is a distinctly different virus and belongs to a new species of the genus Polerovirus. "
negative,"Biodiversity seen through the perspective of insects: 10 simple rules on methodological choices and experimental design for genomic studies. Massively parallel DNA sequencing opens up opportunities for bridging multiple temporal and spatial dimensions in biodiversity research, thanks to its efficiency to recover millions of nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, we identify the current status, discuss the main challenges, and look into future perspectives on biodiversity genomics focusing on insects, which arguably constitute the most diverse and ecologically important group among all animals. We suggest 10 simple rules that provide a succinct step-by-step guide and best-practices to anyone interested in biodiversity research through the study of insect genomics. To this end, we review relevant literature on biodiversity and evolutionary research in the field of entomology. Our compilation is targeted at researchers and students who may not yet be specialists in entomology or molecular biology. We foresee that the genomic revolution and its application to the study of non-model insect lineages will represent a major leap to our understanding of insect diversity. "
negative,"Towards the genetic control of insect vectors: An overview. Insects are responsible for the transmission of major infectious diseases. Recent advances in insect genomics and transformation technology provide new strategies for the control of insect borne pathogen transmission and insect pest management. One such strategy is the genetic modification of insects with genes that block pathogen development. Another is to suppress insect populations by releasing either sterile males or males carrying female-specific dominant lethal genes into the environment. Although significant progress has been made in the laboratory, further research is needed to extend these approaches to the field. These insect control strategies offer several advantages over conventional insecticide-based strategies. However, the release of genetically modified insects into the environment should proceed with great caution, after ensuring its safety, and acceptance by the target populations. "
