negative,"A small genomic region containing several loci required for gastrulation in Drosophila. Genetic screens in Drosophila designed to search for loci involved in gastrulation have identified four regions of the genome that are required zygotically for the formation of the ventral furrow. For three of these, the genes responsible for the mutant phenotypes have been found. We now describe a genetic characterization of the fourth region, which encompasses the cytogenetic interval 24C3-25B, and the mapping of genes involved in gastrulation in this region. We have determined the precise breakpoints of several existing deficiencies and have generated new deficiencies. Our results show that the region contains at least three different loci associated with gastrulation effects. One maternal effect gene involved in ventral furrow formation maps at 24F but could not be identified. For a second maternal effect gene which is required for germ band extension, we identify a candidate gene, CG31660, which encodes a G protein coupled receptor. Finally, one gene acts zygotically in ventral furrow formation and we identify it as Traf4. "
positive,"Genome-wide identification of chitin-binding proteins and characterization of BmCBP1 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti BGSC 4C1, a typical strain with toxicity to Lepidoptera insects. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti was used to control caterpillars from 1970s. Here we reported the complete genome of BGSC 4C1, the type strain of this serovar. It has a circular chromosome and six plasmids. The largest plasmid pBMB267 contains five insecticidal crystal protein genes (two copies of cry1Ae, cry1Gb, cry2Ab, and a novel cry1M-type gene) and three vegetative insecticidal protein genes (a novel binary toxin gene operon vip1-vip2 and vip3Aa). Besides, the strain also has many genes encodeing virulence factors, and some secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters involved in synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and bacteriocins. In addition, there is a poly γ-glutamate synthesis gene cluster, whose product is a candidate to control inflammasome-mediated disorders and potential in many other fields. "
negative,"Expansion of LINEs and species-specific DNA repeats drives genome expansion in Asian Gypsy Moths. Two subspecies of Asian gypsy moth (AGM), Lymantria dispar asiatica and L. dispar japonica, pose a serious alien invasive threat to North American forests. Despite decades of research on the ecology and biology of this pest, limited AGM-specific genomic resources are currently available. Here, we report on the genome sequences and functional content of these AGM subspecies. The genomes of L.d. asiatica and L.d. japonica are the largest lepidopteran genomes sequenced to date, totaling 921 and 999 megabases, respectively. Large genome size in these subspecies is driven by the accumulation of specific classes of repeats. Genome-wide metabolic pathway reconstructions suggest strong genomic signatures of energy-related pathways in both subspecies, dominated by metabolic functions related to thermogenesis. The genome sequences reported here will provide tools for probing the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic traits that are thought to enhance AGM invasiveness. "
negative,"Caste development and reproduction: a genome-wide analysis of hallmarks of insect eusociality. The honey bee queen and worker castes are a model system for developmental plasticity. We used established expressed sequence tag information for a Gene Ontology based annotation of genes that are differentially expressed during caste development. Metabolic regulation emerged as a major theme, with a caste-specific difference in the expression of oxidoreductases vs. hydrolases. Motif searches in upstream regions revealed group-specific motifs, providing an entry point to cis-regulatory network studies on caste genes. For genes putatively involved in reproduction, meiosis-associated factors came out as highly conserved, whereas some determinants of embryonic axes either do not have clear orthologs (bag of marbles, gurken, torso), or appear to be lacking (trunk) in the bee genome. Our results are the outcome of a first genome-based initiative to provide an annotated framework for trends in gene regulation during female caste differentiation (representing developmental plasticity) and reproduction. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of a genomic clone for the gene of an insect molting enzyme, chitinase. Genomic clones for a chitinolytic enzyme were isolated from a library of Sau 3A digested DNA from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, using a previously isolated chitinase cDNA clone as a probe [Kramer et al., Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 23, 691-701 (1993)]. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot analysis of four genomic clones suggested that these are overlapping clones. Sequence analysis of the genomic clones and Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA also suggest that the M. sexta genome has only one chitinase gene detectable by the cDNA probe. This gene is organized into at least 11 exons in a region spanning > 11 kb. The sequenced M. sexta chitinase gene has a series of exons corresponding to identifiable structural / functional regions of the protein. Similarities in structure and organization between the M. sexta chitinase gene and chitinase genes from other sources are described. "
negative,"The genomics of insecticide resistance: insights from recent studies in African malaria vectors. Over 80% of the world's population is at risk from arthropod-vectored diseases, and arthropod crop pests are a significant threat to food security. Insecticides are our front-line response for controlling these disease vectors and pests, and consequently the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance is of global concern. Here we provide a brief overview of how genomics can be used to implement effective insecticide resistance management (IRM), with a focus on recent advances in the study of Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria in Africa. These advances unlock the potential for a predictive form of IRM, allowing tractable feedback for stakeholders, where the latest field data and well parameterised models can maximise the lifetime and effectiveness of available insecticides. "
negative,"Chromosomal deletions mediated by CRISPR / Cas9 in Helicoverpa armigera. Helicoverpa armigera, cotton bollworm, is one of the most disastrous pests worldwide, threatening various food and economic crops. Functional genomic tools may provide efficient approaches for its management. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, dependent on a single guide RNA (sgRNA), has been used to induce indels for targeted mutagenesis in cotton bollworm. However, genomic deletions may be more desirable to disrupt the function of noncoding genes or regulatory sequences. By injecting two sgRNAs with Cas9 protein targeting different exons, we obtained predictable genomic deletions of several hundred bases. We achieved this type of modification with different combinations of sgRNA pairs, including HaCad and HaABCC2. Our finding indicated that CRISPR / Cas9 can be used as an efficient tool to engineer genomes with chromosomal deletion in H. armigera. "
negative,"Disease vectors in the era of next generation sequencing. Almost 20 % of all infectious human diseases are vector borne and, together, are responsible for over one million deaths per annum. Over the past decade, the decreasing costs of massively parallel sequencing technologies have facilitated the agnostic interrogation of insect vector genomes, giving medical entomologists access to an ever-expanding volume of high-quality genomic and transcriptomic data. In this review, we highlight how genomics resources have provided new insights into the physiology, behavior, and evolution of human disease vectors within the context of the global health landscape. "
negative,"Rapid evolution in insect pests: the importance of space and time in population genomics studies. Pest species in agroecosystems often exhibit patterns of rapid evolution to environmental and human-imposed selection pressures. Although the role of adaptive processes is well accepted, few insect pests have been studied in detail and most research has focused on selection at insecticide resistance candidate genes. Emerging genomic datasets provide opportunities to detect and quantify selection in insect pest populations, and address long-standing questions about mechanisms underlying rapid evolutionary change. We examine the strengths of recent studies that stratify population samples both in space (along environmental gradients and comparing ancestral vs. derived populations) and in time (using chronological sampling, museum specimens and comparative phylogenomics), resulting in critical insights on evolutionary processes, and providing new directions for studying pests in agroecosystems. "
negative,"Genomic data reveal high conservation but divergent evolutionary pattern of Polycomb / Trithorax group genes in arthropods. Epigenetic gene control is maintained by chromatin-associated Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) genes, which act antagonistically via the interplay between PcG and TrxG regulation to generate silenced or permissive transcriptional states. In this study, we searched for PcG / TrxG genes in 180 arthropod genomes, covering all the sequenced arthropod genomes at the time of conducting this study, to perform a global investigation of PcG / TrxG genes in a phylogenetic frame. Results of ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed that the ancestor of arthropod species has an almost complete repertoire of PcG / TrxG genes, and most of these genes were seldom lost above order level. The domain diversity analysis indicated that the PcG / TrxG genes show variable extent of domain structure changes; some of these changes could be associated with lineage-specific events. The likelihood ratio tests for selection pressure detected a number of PcG / TrxG genes which underwent episodic positive selection on the branch leading to the insects with holometabolous development. These results suggest that, despite their high conservation across arthropod species, different members of PcG / TrxG genes showed considerable differences in domain structure and sequence divergence in arthropod evolution. Our cross species comparisons using large-scale genomic data provide insights into divergent evolutionary pattern on highly conserved genes in arthropods. "
negative,"Implication for DNA methylation involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). DNA methylation exerts extensive impacts on gene expression of various living organisms exposed to environmental variation. However, little is known whether DNA methylation is involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a worldwide destructive pest of crucifers. In this study, we found that P. xylostella genome exhibited a relatively low level of DNA methylation on the basis of the CpG O / E prediction and experimental validation. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between the stage-specific expressions of PxDNMT1 and DNA methylation levels (5mC content). Particularly, high levels of DNA methylation and gene expression of PxDNMT1 were observed in eggs and mature females of P. xylostella. After host transfer of P. xylostella from Raphanus sativus to Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified some potential genomic loci that might have changed methylation levels. Using the method of fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP), we also found the corresponding genes primarily involved in neural system and signaling. The expressions of six candidate genes were verified by qRT-PCR. One of the genes, Px009600, might be regulated by a DNA methylation-mediated mechanism in response to host transfer. Our study provides evidence for a functional system of DNA methylation in P. xylostella and its possible role in adaptation during host transfer. Further studies should examine methylation as responsive factors to different host plants and environmental cues in insect pests. "
positive,"Biochemical characterization of three midgut chitin deacetylases of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori. Peritrophic membrane (PM) is a chitin and protein-containing extracellular matrix that lines the midgut in most insect species, functioning as a barrier to exogenous toxins and pathogens. Midgut chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are chitin-modifying enzymes known to alter the mechanical property and permeability of PM. However, biochemical properties and specific roles of these enzymes remain elusive. In this study, the midgut-expressed CDAs (BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8) from Bombyx mori were cloned, recombinantly expressed and purified and their enzymatic activities toward PM chitin were determined. Of the three enzymes, BmCDA7 exhibited the highest activity (0.284 μmol / min / μmol), while BmCDA8 showed lower activity of 0.061 μmol / min / μmol. BmCDA6 was inactive towards PM chitin. Gene expression patterns indicated that although all three CDA genes were specifically expressed in the anterior midgut, they differed in their temporal expression patterns. BmCDA6 was expressed almost exclusively at the mid-molt stage, the stage when the PM was thick and with multiple chitin layers. Unlike BmCDA6, high expression levels of BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 were observed only at the feeding stage, the stage when the PM is thin and with fewer chitin layers. The different gene expression patterns and biochemical characteristics provide new information about the functional specialization among BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 proteins. "
positive,"The cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. Members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cysLGIC) superfamily mediate chemical neurotransmission and are studied extensively as potential targets of drugs used to treat neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Insect cys-loop LGICs also have central roles in the nervous system and are targets of highly successful insecticides. Here, we describe the cysLGIC superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is emerging as a highly useful model organism and is deployed as a biological control of insect pests. The wasp superfamily consists of 26 genes, which is the largest insect cysLGIC superfamily characterized, whereas Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum have 23, 21 and 24, respectively. As with Apis, Drosophila and Tribolium, Nasonia possesses ion channels predicted to be gated by acetylcholine, gamma-amino butyric acid, glutamate and histamine, as well as orthologues of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to other insects, wasp cysLGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing, which may also serve to generate species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on N. vitripennis enhance our understanding of cysLGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the study of their function in the wasp model, as well as for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of insect-symbiotic bacteria: influence of host environment on microbial genome composition. Commensal symbionts, thought to be intermediary amid obligate mutualists and facultative parasites, offer insight into forces driving the evolutionary transition into mutualism. Using macroarrays developed for a close relative, Escherichia coli, we utilized a heterologous array hybridization approach to infer the genomic compositions of a clade of bacteria that have recently established symbiotic associations: Sodalis glossinidius with the tsetse fly (Diptera, Glossina spp.) and Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE) with the rice weevil (Coleoptera, Sitophilus oryzae). Functional biologies within their hosts currently reflect different forms of symbiotic associations. Their hosts, members of distant insect taxa, occupy distinct ecological niches and have evolved to survive on restricted diets of blood for tsetse and cereal for the rice weevil. Comparison of genome contents between the two microbes indicates statistically significant differences in the retention of genes involved in carbon compound catabolism, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and transport. The greatest reductions have occurred in carbon catabolism, membrane proteins, and cell structure-related genes for Sodalis and in genes involved in cellular processes (i.e., adaptations towards cellular conditions) for SOPE. Modifications in metabolic pathways, in the form of functional losses complementing particularities in host physiology and ecology, may have occurred upon initial entry from a free-living to a symbiotic state. It is possible that these adaptations, streamlining genomes, act to make a free-living state no longer feasible for the harnessed microbe. "
negative,"Body lice and head lice (Anoplura: Pediculidae) have the smallest genomes of any hemimetabolous insect reported to date. The human body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus L. (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is a vector of several diseases, including louse-borne epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever, whereas the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is more a pest of social concern. Sequencing of the body louse genome has recently been proposed and undertaken by National Human Genome Research Institute. One of the first steps in understanding an organism's genome is to determine its genome size. Here, using flow cytometry determinations, we present evidence that body louse genome size is 104.7 + / - 1.4 Mb for females and 108.3 + / - 1.1 Mb for males. Our results suggest that head lice also have a small genome size, of similar size to the body louse. Thus, Pediculus lice have one of the smallest genome sizes known in insects, suggesting it may be a suitable choice as a minimal hemimetabolous genome. "
positive,"Expression of a novel member of the odorant-binding protein gene family in Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae). We previously showed that gene expression in the midgut of female Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was altered after ingestion of a bloodmeal and some of the expressed cDNAs showed stage-, sex-, and tissue-specific expression. One of these expressed cDNAs, CN G11B, is here shown to be similar to members of a gene family that encodes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 is a cDNA fragment of 721 bp, is incomplete at the 5'-end, and contains a canonical polyadenylic acid tail signal sequence in the 103-bp 3'-untranslated region. Translation of CN G11B.1 provides a putative protein product of 207 amino acids. GenBank tblastx, VectorBase, and Pfam database searches showed identity to hypothetical proteins from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (86%) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (55%). These proteins have structural motifs similar to those found in the gene family that includes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 putative protein has two of the six cysteines that are highly conserved in most invertebrate odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 expression increased in thoraces (6-12 h) and in abdomens (3-48 h) of blood fed female Cx. nigripalpus but was not detected in RNA from heads, indicating a possible role in both chemoreception and blood feeding. "
positive,"Molecular diversity of PBAN family peptides from fire ants. The PBAN / Pyrokinin peptide family is a major neuropeptide family characterized with a common FXPRLamide in the C-termini. These peptides are ubiquitously distributed in the Insecta and are involved in many essential endocrinal functions, e.g., pheromone production. Previous work demonstrated the localization of PBAN in the fire ant central nervous system, and identified a new family of PBAN from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. In this study, we identified five more PBAN / Pyrokinin genes from S. geminata, S. richteri, S. pergandii, S. carolinensis, and a hybrid of S. invicta and S. richteri. The gene sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these species and hybrid, which compared well to the morphologically defined fire ant subgroup complexes. The putative PBAN and other peptides were determined from the amino acid sequences of the PBAN / pyrokinin genes. We summarized all known insect PBAN family neuropeptides, and for the first time constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the full amino acid sequences translated from representative PBAN cDNAs. The PBAN / pyrokinin gene is well conserved in Insecta and probably extends into the Arthropod phylum; however, translated pre-propeptides may vary and functional diversity may be retained, lost, or modified during the evolutionary process. "
negative,"Transient expression of a promoter-reporter construct in differentiated adult salivary glands and embryos of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Vector-borne pathogens develop in close association with specific tissues in their insect hosts. Efforts are being made to characterize insect genes that are expressed in tissues that have important roles in pathogen propagation. Successful transfection and expression of exogenous genes in terminally differentiated tissues of insects has previously proven difficult. Here we report a method that should allow the analysis of genes that are expressed in adult tissues and organs. Transient expression assays have been developed using the salivary glands of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which can now be used to analyze salivary gland-specific promoter sequences. A liposome-based transfection reagent was used to transfect cultured adult salivary glands with a DNA construct carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock 70 promoter. Luciferase activity was detected in glands 18-20 hr post-transfection. This assay can now be used to determine the regulatory activity of other putative promoter sequences from salivary gland-specific genes. Alternatively, the assay may be used to study the effect of recombinant gene expression on parasite invasion and development. In addition, transient expression of gene constructs in embryos is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing genes that are expressed at this stage of the mosquito life cycle. "
positive,"Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in fruit fly Bactrocera minax. BACKGROUND: Vision plays a critical role in host location and oviposition behavior for herbivorous insects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying visual regulation in host recognition and oviposition site selection in insects remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the key visual genes that are linked to the host plant location of the fruit fly, Bactrocera minax. RESULTS: Using a host specialist fruit fly, B. minax, which lays eggs only into immature green citrus fruit, we undertook behavioral, transcriptomic, and RNAi research to identify the molecular basis for host fruit color recognition. In laboratory and field assays we found that adults prefer green over other colors, and this preference is significantly increased in sexually mature over immature flies. Furthermore, we identified that the Rh6 gene, responsible for green spectral sensitivity, has elevated expression in mature flies over immature flies. RNAi suppression of Rh6 eliminated the preference for green, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of eggs laid by B. minax in green unripe citrus. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in B. minax, providing a genetic basis for visual host location in a non-model insect herbivore. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Many roads to resistance: how invertebrates adapt to Bt toxins. The Cry family of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal and nematicidal proteins constitutes a valuable source of environmentally benign compounds for the control of insect pests and disease agents. An understanding of Cry toxin resistance at a molecular level will be critical to the long-term utility of this technology; it may also shed light on basic mechanisms used by other bacterial toxins that target specific organisms or cell types. Selection and cross-resistance studies have confirmed that genetic adaptation can elicit varying patterns of Cry toxin resistance, which has been associated with deficient protoxin activation by host proteases, and defective Cry toxin-binding cell surface molecules, such as cadherins, aminopeptidases and glycolipids. Recent work also suggests Cry toxin resistance may be induced in invertebrates as an active immune response. The use of model invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as advances in insect genomics, are likely to accelerate efforts to clone Cry toxin resistance genes and come to a detailed and broad understanding of Cry toxin resistance. "
negative,"Genome-wide microarray screening for Bombyx mori genes related to transmitting the determination outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs. The bivoltine silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) exhibits a maternally controlled embryonic diapause. Maternal silkworms decide whether to lay diapause or nondiapause eggs depending on environmental factors such as the temperature and photoperiod during the egg and larval stages, and then induce diapause eggs during the pupal stage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that conveys the outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs from the egg or larval stages to the pupal stage. This study used microarray analysis to investigate differentially expressed genes in the larval brains of diapause- and nondiapause-egg producers, to which bivoltine silkworms were destined by thermal or photic stimulation during the egg stage. The cytochrome P450 18a1 and Krüppel homolog 1 genes were upregulated in producers of diapause eggs compared with those of nondiapause eggs under both experimental conditions. Cytochrome P450 18a1 encodes a key enzyme for steroid hormone inactivation and Krüppel homolog 1 is an early juvenile hormone-inducible gene that mediates the repression of metamorphosis. The upregulation of these genes during the larval stage might be involved in the signaling pathway that transmits information about the diapause program from the egg stage to the pupal stage in the silkworm. "
positive,"Identification and functional characterisation of a novel N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid metabolising cytochrome P450, CYP9Q6, from the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Recent work has shown that two bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5, are important biochemical determinants of sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we report the characterisation of a third P450 gene CYP9Q6, previously mis-annotated in the genome of B. terrestris, encoding an enzyme that metabolises the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids thiacloprid and acetamiprid with high efficiency. The genomic location and complete ORF of CYP9Q6 was corroborated by PCR and its metabolic activity characterised in vitro by expression in an insect cell line. CYP9Q6 metabolises both thiacloprid and acetamiprid more rapidly than the previously reported CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5. We further demonstrate a direct, in vivo correlation between the expression of the CYP9Q6 enzyme in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and an increased tolerance to thiacloprid and acetamiprid. We conclude that CYP9Q6 is an efficient metaboliser of N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids and likely plays a key role in the high tolerance of B. terrestris to these insecticides. "
negative,"Butterfly genomics eclosing. Technological and conceptual advances of the last decade have led to an explosion of genomic data and the emergence of new research avenues. Evolutionary and ecological functional genomics, with its focus on the genes that affect ecological success and adaptation in natural populations, benefits immensely from a phylogenetically widespread sampling of biological patterns and processes. Among those organisms outside established model systems, butterflies offer exceptional opportunities for multidisciplinary research on the processes generating and maintaining variation in ecologically relevant traits. Here we highlight research on wing color pattern variation in two groups of Nymphalid butterflies, the African species Bicyclus anynana (subfamily Satyrinae) and species of the South American genus Heliconius (subfamily Heliconiinae), which are emerging as important systems for studying the nature and origins of functional diversity. Growing genomic resources including genomic and cDNA libraries, dense genetic maps, high-density gene arrays, and genetic transformation techniques are extending current gene mapping and expression profiling analysis and enabling the next generation of research questions linking genes, development, form, and fitness. Efforts to develop such resources in Bicyclus and Heliconius underscore the general challenges facing the larger research community and highlight the need for a community-wide effort to extend ongoing functional genomic research on butterflies. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome of Diaphania indica(saunders) (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) and implications for its phylogeny. The cucumber moth, Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepipdoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important insect pest of cucurbits and is widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Herein, we obtained entire mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of D. indica using polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing method. The complete mitogenome of D. indica is 15,367bp long, including 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and an A+T rich element. Both the AT skew and GC skew are slightly negative in the newly sequenced mitogenome. All of the 12 PCGs initiate with canonical start codon (ATN), except for coxI that initiate with CGA. The A+T rich element of D. indica is 467bp long and contains many features common to Pyraloidea insects. In addition, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the eight superfamiles of lepidopterans by employing Neighbor joining (NJ) and Maximum likelihood (ML) methods, and both yielded identical topologies. The phylogeny results supported the monophyly of lepidopteran superfamilies. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree showed that D. indica belongs to the Pyraloidea superfamily. "
negative,"A picorna-like virus from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta: initial discovery, genome sequence, and characterization. We report the first discovery and genome sequence of a virus infecting the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. The 8026 nucleotide, polyadenylated, RNA genome encoded two large open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), flanked and separated by 27, 223, and 171 nucleotide untranslated regions, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 5' proximal ORF1 (nucleotides 28 to 4218) exhibited significant identity and possessed consensus sequences characteristic of the helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence motifs from picornaviruses, picorna-like viruses, comoviruses, caliciviruses, and sequiviruses. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 3' proximal ORF2 (nucleotides 4390-7803) showed similarity to structural proteins in picorna-like viruses, especially the acute bee paralysis virus. Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained samples from virus-infected fire ants revealed isometric particles with a diameter of 31 nm, consistent with Picornaviridae. A survey for the fire ant virus from areas around Florida revealed a pattern of fairly widespread distribution. Among 168 nests surveyed, 22.9% were infected. The virus was found to infect all fire ant caste members and developmental stages, including eggs, early (1st-2nd) and late (3rd-4th) instars, worker pupae, workers, sexual pupae, alates ( male symbol and female symbol ), and queens. The virus, tentatively named S. invicta virus (SINV-1), appears to belong to the picorna-like viruses. We did not observe any perceptible symptoms among infected nests in the field. However, in every case where an SINV-1-infected colony was excavated from the field with an inseminated queen and held in the laboratory, all of the brood in these colonies died within 3 months. "
negative,"The GH / IGF-I axis and longevity. Several converging lines of evidence obtained over the last years in a wide variety of experimental model organisms suggest that the ageing process is regulated by genes that encode proteins from the somatotroph axis: longevity genes like daf-2, which were identified using mutant Caenorhabditis elegans strains, turned out to be orthologues of the mammalian genes encoding insulin-like signalling cascade proteins. Transgenic flies with mutations in the corresponding insect genes showed a similar pattern of increased lifespan. Finally, mice with spontaneous mutations leading to pituitary hormone deficiency significantly outlived controls. While these and other genetic models suggest that the downregulation of the somatotroph axis can slow the ageing process, other results from studies using pharmacological administration of growth hormone suggest that such stimulating treatment can restore some of the phenotypic traits associated with youth. To better understand the role of the insulin-like receptors in mammalian lifespan regulation and ageing, we explored the phenotype of heterozygous IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) knockout mice. Compared with control littermates these mutants live longer without any obvious impairment of their health and physiology, except a reduced glucose tolerance that we observed in males. These IGF1R(+ / -) mutants were also more resistant to oxidative stress in vivo, and we identified a possible molecular pathway linking underphosphorylation of IGF-I receptors to the lack of activation of p66Shc, a protein capable of increasing resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of a set of downstream genes. These and other results suggest that in mammals too, lifespan can be increased by continuous, long-term downregulation of IGF signalling. Since growth hormone administration normally stimulates IGF production in tissues, the question arises whether the beneficial effects of GH, as reported by others, could be IGF independent. This hypothesis can be addressed, for example, by adequately combining existing transgenic mouse models. "
positive,"Isolation of diapause-regulated genes from the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis by suppressive subtractive hybridization. Subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH) was used to characterize the diapause transcriptome of the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. Through these efforts, we isolated 97 unique clones which were used as probes in northern hybridization to assess their expression during diapause. Of these, 17 were confirmed to be diapause upregulated and 1 was diapause downregulated, while 12 were shown to be unaffected by diapause in this species. The diapause upregulated genes fall into several broad categories including heat shock proteins, heavy metal responsive genes, neuropeptides, structural genes, regulatory elements, and several genes of unknown function. In combination with other large-scale analyses of gene expression during diapause, this study assists in the characterization of the S. crassipalpis diapause transcriptome, and begins to identify common elements involved in diapause across diverse taxa.

negative,"Identification of two arginases generated by alternative splicing in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. Here, we have cloned two arginase cDNAs from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The analysis of exon / intron structures showed that the two mRNAs named bmarg-r and bmarg-f were generated from a single gene by alternative usage of exons. The bmarg-r and bmarg-f were predicted to encode almost the same amino acid sequences, except that the latter had additional ten N-terminal residues. Recombinant bmARG-r and bmARG-f in Escherichia coli cell lysates were roughly similar to each other in enzymatic characteristics, which did not show large difference from those of arginases assayed by using tissue extracts. Differential RT-PCR experiments and tissue distribution analyses of arginase activity indicated that the bmarg-r gene is expressed in the male reproductive organs, especially in the glandula lacteola and vesicular seminalis, from which it is secreted to the seminal fluid and transferred to the female during copulation, whereas the bmarg-f gene is expressed in the larval and adult nonreproductive organs including the fat body and muscle, where the produced arginase proteins are considered to stay in the cells. Thus, the two silkworm arginase isoforms may have a difference in whether or not the product is excreted out of the cells in which it is synthesized. "
negative,"Extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice (Phthiraptera: Insecta). The arrangement of genes in the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of most insects is the same, or near-identical, to that inferred to be ancestral for insects. We sequenced the entire mt genome of the small pigeon louse, Campanulotes bidentatus compar, and part of the mt genomes of nine other species of lice. These species were from six families and the three main suborders of the order Phthiraptera. There was no variation in gene arrangement among species within a family but there was much variation in gene arrangement among the three suborders of lice. There has been an extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice! "
negative,"Rice bean: a lesser known pulse with well-recognized potential. MAIN CONCLUSION: Required genetic resources for the improvement of agronomic, nutritional and economic value of rice bean are available in the world collection. International cooperative effort is required to utilize and conserve them. Rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi], a lesser known pulse among the Asiatic Vigna, has long been considered as a food security crop of small and marginal farmers of Southeast Asia. Considered as a nutritionally rich food and fodder, it is also a source of genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance including drought, soil acidity and storage pest. Although it spread from its centre of domestication in the Indo-China region to other parts around the world, it never became an important crop anywhere probably because of agronomic disadvantages. Crop improvement for determinate nature, good yield, less variable seed colour, pleasant organoleptic properties and lower antinutrients is required. Scanning of scientific literature indicates that genetic resources with desirable agronomic and nutritional traits exist within the current collection but are spread across countries. Genomic studies in the species indicate that except for insect resistance and aluminium toxicity tolerance, not much attention has been paid to decipher and utilize other stress tolerance and nutritional quality traits. Collaborative efforts towards improving farming, food, trade value and off-farm conservation of rice bean would not only help marginal farmers but will also help to preserve the yet to be explored genomic resources available in this sturdy pulse.

negative,"Sequencing of Culex quinquefasciatus establishes a platform for mosquito comparative genomics. Culex quinquefasciatus (the southern house mosquito) is an important mosquito vector of viruses such as West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as well as of nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. C. quinquefasciatus is one species within the Culex pipiens species complex and can be found throughout tropical and temperate climates of the world. The ability of C. quinquefasciatus to take blood meals from birds, livestock, and humans contributes to its ability to vector pathogens between species. Here, we describe the genomic sequence of C. quinquefasciatus: Its repertoire of 18,883 protein-coding genes is 22% larger than that of Aedes aegypti and 52% larger than that of Anopheles gambiae with multiple gene-family expansions, including olfactory and gustatory receptors, salivary gland genes, and genes associated with xenobiotic detoxification. "
negative,"Pheromone production in bark beetles. The first aggregation pheromone components from bark beetles were identified in 1966 as a mixture of ipsdienol, ipsenol and verbenol. Since then, a number of additional components have been identified as both aggregation and anti-aggregation pheromones, with many of them being monoterpenoids or derived from monoterpenoids. The structural similarity between the major pheromone components of bark beetles and the monoterpenes found in the host trees, along with the association of monoterpenoid production with plant tissue, led to the paradigm that most if not all bark beetle pheromone components were derived from host tree precursors, often with a simple hydroxylation producing the pheromone. In the 1990 s there was a paradigm shift as evidence for de novo biosynthesis of pheromone components began to accumulate, and it is now recognized that most bark beetle monoterpenoid aggregation pheromone components are biosynthesized de novo. The bark beetle aggregation pheromones are released from the frass, which is consistent with the isoprenoid aggregation pheromones, including ipsdienol, ipsenol and frontalin, being produced in midgut tissue. It appears that exo-brevocomin is produced de novo in fat body tissue, and that verbenol, verbenone and verbenene are produced from dietary α-pinene in fat body tissue. Combined biochemical, molecular and functional genomics studies in Ips pini yielded the discovery and characterization of the enzymes that convert mevalonate pathway intermediates to pheromone components, including a novel bifunctional geranyl diphosphate synthase / myrcene synthase, a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates myrcene to ipsdienol, and an oxidoreductase that interconverts ipsdienol and ipsdienone to achieve the appropriate stereochemistry of ipsdienol for pheromonal activity. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes and their corresponding enzymes proved complex and diverse in different species. Mevalonate pathway genes in pheromone producing male I. pini have much higher basal levels than in females, and feeding induces their expression. In I. duplicatus and I. pini, juvenile hormone III (JH III) induces pheromone production in the absence of feeding, whereas in I. paraconfusus and I. confusus, topically applied JH III does not induce pheromone production. In all four species, feeding induces pheromone production. While many of the details of pheromone production, including the site of synthesis, pathways and knowledge of the enzymes involved are known for Ips, less is known about pheromone production in Dendroctonus. Functional genomics studies are under way in D. ponderosae, which should rapidly increase our understanding of pheromone production in this genus. This chapter presents a historical development of what is known about pheromone production in bark beetles, emphasizes the genomic and post-genomic work in I. pini and points out areas where research is needed to obtain a more complete understanding of pheromone production. "
negative,"Bacillus thuringiensis toxin resistance mechanisms among Lepidoptera: progress on genomic approaches to uncover causal mutations in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. Transgenic plants that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (Cry) protein toxins (Bt crops) effectively control feeding by the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, although documented resistance evolution among a number of species in both the laboratory and field has heightened concerns about the durability of this technology. Research has provided major insights into the mutations that alter Bt toxin binding receptor structure and function within the midgut of Lepidoptera that directly impacts the efficacy of Bt toxins, and potentially leads to the evolution of resistance to Bt crops in the field. In this manuscript we provide an overview of available data on the identification of genes involved in high levels of resistance to Cry toxins, with emphasis on resistance described for O. nubilalis as the main target of Bt corn. "
negative,"Ascovirus P64 Homologs: A Novel Family of Large Cationic Proteins That Condense Viral Genomic DNA for Encapsidation. Eukaryotic dsDNA viruses use small basic protamine-like proteins or histones, typically <15 kDa, to condense and encapsidate their genomic (g)DNAs during virogenesis. Ascoviruses are large dsDNA (~100⁻200 kbp) viruses that are pathogenic to lepidopteran larvae. Little is known about the molecular basis for condensation and encapsidation of their gDNAs. Previous proteomic analysis showed that Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus (SfAV-1a) virions contain a large unique DNA-binding protein (P64; 64 kDa, pI = 12.2) with a novel architecture proposed to condense its gDNA. Here we used physical, biochemical, and transmission electron microscopy techniques to demonstrate that P64's basic C-terminal domain condenses SfAV-1a gDNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that only P64 homologs in other ascovirus virions are unique in stably binding DNA. As similar protein families or subfamilies were not identified in extensive database searches, our collective data suggest that ascovirus P64 homologs comprise a novel family of atypical large viral gDNA condensing proteins.

negative,"Maize plants prime anti-herbivore responses by the memorizing and recalling of airborne information in their genome. Intact maize plants prime for defensive action against herbivory in response to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HI PVs) emitted from caterpillar-infested conspecific plants. The recent research showed that the primed defense in receiver plants that had been exposed to HI PVs was maintained for at least 5 d after exposure. Herbivory triggered the receiver plants to enhance the expression of a defense gene for trypsin inhibitor (TI ). At the upstream sequence of a TI gene, non-methylated cytosine residues were observed in the genome of HI PV-exposed plants more frequently than in that of healthy plant volatile-exposed plants. These findings provide an innovative mechanism for the memory of HI PV-mediated habituation for plant defense. This mechanism and further innovations for priming of defenses via plant communications will contribute to the development of plant volatile-based pest management methods in agriculture and horticulture. "
negative,"Plant-mediated RNAi silences midgut-expressed genes in congeneric lepidopteran insects in nature. BACKGROUND: Plant-mediated RNAi (PMRi) silencing of insect genes has enormous potential for crop protection, but whether it works robustly under field conditions, particularly with lepidopteran pests, remains controversial. Wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and cultivated tobacco (N. tabacum) (Solanaceae) is attacked by two closely related specialist herbivores Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae). When M. sexta larvae attack transgenic N. attenuata plants expressing double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) targeting M. sexta's midgut-expressed genes, the nicotine-ingestion induced cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (invert repeat (ir)CYP6B46-plants) and the lyciumoside-IV-ingestion induced β-glucosidase1 (irBG1-plants), these larval genes which are important for the larvae's response to ingested host toxins, are strongly silenced. RESULTS: Here we show that the PMRi procedure also silences the homologous genes in native M. quinquemaculata larvae feeding on irCYP6B46 and irBG1-transgenic N. attenuata plants in nature. The PMRi lines shared 98 and 96% sequence similarity with M. quinquemaculata homologous coding sequences, and CYP6B46 and BG1 transcripts were reduced by ca. 90 and 80%, without reducing the transcripts of the larvae's most similar, potential off-target genes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the PMRi procedure can robustly and specifically silence genes in native congeneric insects that share sufficient sequence similarity and with the careful selection of targets, might protect crops from attack by congeneric-groups of insect pests. "
positive,"Two functionally distinct CYP4G genes of Anopheles gambiae contribute to cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) biosynthesis is a major pathway of insect physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster the cytochrome P450 CYP4G1 catalyses the insect-specific oxidative decarbonylation step, while in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, two CYP4G paralogues, CYP4G16 and CYP4G17 are present. Analysis of the subcellular localization of CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 in larval and pupal stages revealed that CYP4G16 preserves its PM localization across developmental stages analyzed; however CYPG17 is differentially localized in two distinct types of pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes of larval and adult developmental specificity. Western blot analysis showed the presence of two CYP4G17 forms, potentially associated with each oenocyte type. Both An. gambiae CYP4Gs were expressed in D. melanogaster flies in a Cyp4g1 silenced background in order to functionally characterize them in vivo. CYP4G16, CYP4G17 or their combination rescued the lethal phenotype of Cyp4g1-knock down flies, demonstrating that CYP4G17 is also a functional decarbonylase, albeit of somewhat lower efficiency than CYP4G16 in Drosophila. Flies expressing mosquito CYP4G16 and / or CYP4G17 produced similar CHC profiles to 'wild-type' flies expressing the endogenous CYP4G1, but they also produce very long-chain dimethyl-branched CHCs not detectable in wild type flies, suggesting that the specificity of the CYP4G enzymes contributes to determine the complexity of the CHC blend. In conclusion, both An. gambiae CYP4G enzymes contribute to the unique Anopheles CHC profile, which has been associated to defense, adult desiccation tolerance, insecticide penetration rate and chemical communication. "
negative,"Evidence of two mechanisms involved in Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis decreased toxicity against mosquito larvae: Genome dynamic and toxins stability. Biopesticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis are the most used and most successful around the world. This bacterium is characterized by a dynamic genome able to win or lose genetic materials which leads to a decrease in its effectiveness. The detection of such phenomena is of great importance to monitor the stability of B. thuringiensis strains in industrial production processes of biopesticides. New local B. thuringiensis israelensis isolates were investigated. They present variable levels of delta-endotoxins production and insecticidal activities against Aedes aegypti larvae. Searching on the origin of this variability, molecular and biochemical analyses were performed. The obtained results describe two main reasons of the decrease of B. thuringiensis israelensis insecticidal activity. The first reason was the deletion of cry4Aa and cry10Aa genes from the 128-kb pBtoxis plasmid as evidenced in three strains (BLB124, BLB199 and BLB506) among five. The second was the early degradation of Cry toxins by proteases in larvae midgut mainly due to some amino acids substitutions evidenced in Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa δ-endotoxins detected in BLB356. Before biological treatment based on B. thuringiensis israelensis, the studies of microflore in each ecosystem have a great importance to succeed pest management programs.  "
negative,"Genome-based identification of spliceosomal proteins in the silk moth Bombyx mori. Pre-messenger RNA splicing is a highly conserved eukaryotic cellular function that takes place by way of a large, RNA-protein assembly known as the spliceosome. In the mammalian system, nearly 300 proteins associate with uridine-rich small nuclear (sn)RNAs to form this complex. Some of these splicing factors are ubiquitously present in the spliceosome, whereas others are involved only in the processing of specific transcripts. Several proteomics analyses have delineated the proteins of the spliceosome in several species. In this study, we mine multiple sequence data sets of the silk moth Bombyx mori in an attempt to identify the entire set of known spliceosomal proteins. Five data sets were utilized, including the 3X, 6X, and Build 2.0 genomic contigs as well as the expressed sequence tag and protein libraries. While homologs for 88% of vertebrate splicing factors were delineated in the Bombyx mori genome, there appear to be several spliceosomal polypeptides absent in Bombyx mori and seven additional insect species. This apparent increase in spliceosomal complexity in vertebrates may reflect the tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing requirements in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 eukaryotic taxa using the core splicing factors suggest that the essential functional units of the pre-mRNA processing machinery have remained highly conserved from yeast to humans. The Sm and LSm proteins are the most conserved, whereas proteins of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle are the most divergent. These data highlight both the differential conservation and relative phylogenetic signals of the essential spliceosomal components throughout evolution. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Sasakia funebris (Leech) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and comparison with other Apaturinae insects. Sasakia funebris, a member of the lepidopteran family, Nymphalidae (superfamily Papilionoidea) is a rare species and is found only in some areas of South China. In this study, the 15,233 bp long complete mitochondrial genome of S. funebris was determined, and harbors the gene arrangement identical to all other sequenced lepidopteran insects. The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A+T biased, accounting for 81.2%. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) start with typical ATN codons, except for COI which begins with the CGA codon. All tRNAs have a typical clover-leaf secondary structure, except for tRNASer(AGN), the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of which forms a simple loop. The S. funebris A+T-rich region of 370 bp contains several features common to the Lepidoptera insects, including the motif ATAGA followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, and two tandem repeats consisting of 18 bp repeat units and 14 bp repeat units. The phylogenetic analyses of Apaturinae based on mitogenome sequences showed: (S. funebris+Sasakia charonda)+(Apatura metis+Apatura ilia). This result is consistent with the morphological classification. "
negative,"Genome interdependence in insect-bacterium symbioses. Symbioses between unicellular and multicellular organisms have contributed significantly to the evolution of life on Earth. As exemplified by several studies of bacterium-insect symbioses, modern genomic techniques are providing exciting new information about the molecular basis and the biological roles of these complex relationships, revealing for instance that symbionts have lost many genes for functions that are provided by the host, but that they can provide amino acids that the host cannot synthesize. "
positive,"Characterization of a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene from Spodoptera exigua and its function identification through RNA interference. Trehalose is an important disaccharide and a key regulation factor for the development of many organisms, including plants, bacteria, fungi and insects. In order to study the trehalose synthesis pathway, a cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Spodoptera exigua (SeTPS) was cloned which contained an open reading frame of 2481 nucleotides encoding a protein of 826 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 92.65kDa. The SeTPS genome has 12 exons and 11 introns. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body and in the ovary. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in day 1 S. exigua pupae. The concentrations of trehalose and glucose in the hemolymph were determined by HPLC and showed that they varied at different developmental stages and were negatively correlated to each other. The survival rates of the insects injected with dsRNA corresponding to SeTPS gene reached 53.95%, 49.06%, 34.86% and 33.24% for 36, 48, 60 and 204h post-injection respectively which were significantly lower than those of the insects in three control groups. These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and potential function of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene. "
negative,"Post-integration behavior of a Minos transposon in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Transposable elements represent important tools to perform functional studies in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, the remobilization properties of transposable elements have been utilized for enhancer-trapping and insertional mutagenesis experiments, which have considerably helped in the functional characterization of the fruitfly genome. In Anopheles mosquitoes, the sole vectors of human malaria, as well as in other mosquito vectors of disease, the use of transposons has also been advocated to achieve the spread of anti-parasitic genes throughout field populations. Here we report on the post-integration behavior of the Minos transposon in both the germ-line and somatic tissues of Anopheles mosquitoes. Transgenic An. stephensi lines developed using the piggyBac transposon and expressing the Minos transposase were tested for their ability to remobilize an X-linked Minos element. Germ-line remobilization events were not detected, while somatic excisions and transpositions were consistently recovered. The analysis of these events showed that Minos activity in Anopheles cells is characterized by unconventional functionality of the transposon. In the two cases analyzed, re-integration of the transposon occurred onto the same X chromosome, suggesting a tendency for local hopping of Minos in the mosquito genome. This is the first report of the post-integration behavior of a transposable element in a human malaria vector. "
negative,"Enhanced whitefly resistance in transgenic tobacco plants expressing double stranded RNA of v-ATPase A gene. BACKGROUND: Expression of double strand RNA (dsRNA) designed against important insect genes in transgenic plants have been shown to give protection against pests through RNA interference (RNAi), thus opening the way for a new generation of insect-resistant crops. We have earlier compared the efficacy of dsRNAs / siRNAs, against a number of target genes, for interference in growth of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) upon oral feeding. The v-ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) coding gene was identified as a crucial target. We now report the effectiveness of transgenic tobacco plants expressing siRNA to silence v-ATPaseA gene expression for the control of whitefly infestation. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Transgenic tobacco lines were developed for the expression of long dsRNA precursor to make siRNA and knock down the v-ATPaseA mRNA in whitefly. Molecular analysis and insecticidal properties of the transgenic plants established the formation of siRNA targeting the whitefly v-ATPaseA, in the leaves. The transcript level of v-ATPaseA in whiteflies was reduced up to 62% after feeding on the transgenic plants. Heavy infestation of whiteflies on the control plants caused significant loss of sugar content which led to the drooping of leaves. The transgenic plants did not show drooping effect. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Host plant derived pest resistance was achieved against whiteflies by genetic transformation of tobacco which generated siRNA against the whitefly v-ATPaseA gene. Transgenic tobacco lines expressing dsRNA of v-ATPaseA, delivered sufficient siRNA to whiteflies feeding on them, mounting a significant silencing response, leading to their mortality. The transcript level of the target gene was reduced in whiteflies feeding on transgenic plants. The strategy can be taken up for genetic engineering of plants to control whiteflies in field crops. "
negative,"Experimental RNomics and genomic comparative analysis reveal a large group of species-specific small non-message RNAs in the silkworm Bombyx mori. Accumulating evidences show that small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. The silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of lepidopterous pests. Here, we have performed the first systematic identification and analysis of intermediate size ncRNAs (50-500 nt) in the silkworm. We identified 189 novel ncRNAs, including 141 snoRNAs, six snRNAs, three tRNAs, one SRP and 38 unclassified ncRNAs. Forty ncRNAs showed significantly altered expression during silkworm development or across specific stage transitions. Genomic comparisons revealed that 123 of these ncRNAs are potentially silkworm-specific. Analysis of the genomic organization of the ncRNA loci showed that 32.62% of the novel snoRNA loci are intergenic, and that all the intronic snoRNAs follow the pattern of one-snoRNA-per-intron. Target site analysis predicted a total of 95 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modification sites of rRNAs, snRNAs and tRNAs. Together, these findings provide new clues for future functional study of ncRNA during insect development and evolution. "
negative,"Host-mediated RNA interference targeting a cuticular protein gene impaired fecundity in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests. This study demonstrated the potential of MyCP dsRNA in developing RNAi-based resistance to M. persicae. RNAi-mediated resistance is expected to be more durable compared with other transgenic strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Evolution in the fast lane: rapidly evolving sex-related genes in Drosophila. A large portion of the annotated genes in Drosophila melanogaster show sex-biased expression, indicating that sex and reproduction-related genes (SRR genes) represent an appreciable component of the genome. Previous studies, in which subsets of genes were compared among few Drosophila species, have found that SRR genes exhibit unusual evolutionary patterns. Here, we have used the newly released genome sequences from 12 Drosophila species, coupled to a larger set of SRR genes, to comprehensively test the generality of these patterns. Among 2505 SRR genes examined, including ESTs with biased expression in reproductive tissues and genes characterized as involved in gametogenesis, we find that a relatively high proportion of SRR genes have experienced accelerated divergence throughout the genus Drosophila. Several testis-specific genes, male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs), and spermatogenesis genes show lineage-specific bursts of accelerated evolution and positive selection. SFP genes also show evidence of lineage-specific gene loss and / or gain. These results bring us closer to understanding the details of the evolutionary dynamics of SRR genes with respect to species divergence. "
negative,"A whole genome screening and RNA interference identify a juvenile hormone esterase-like gene of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in preventing precocious metamorphosis and stimulating reproduction. Thus, its hemolymph titer should be under a tight control. As a negative controller, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) performs a rapid breakdown of residual JH in the hemolymph during last instar to induce a larval-to-pupal metamorphosis. A whole genome of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, has been annotated and proposed 11 JHE candidates. Sequence analysis using conserved motifs commonly found in other JHEs proposed a putative JHE (Px004817). Px004817 (64.61 kDa, pI=5.28) exhibited a characteristic JHE expression pattern by showing high peak at the early last instar, at which JHE enzyme activity was also at a maximal level. RNA interference of Px004817 reduced JHE activity and interrupted pupal development with a significant increase of larval period. This study identifies Px004817 as a JHE-like gene of P. xylostella. "
negative,"The genome biology of phytoplasma: modulators of plants and insects. Phytoplasmas are bacterial pathogens of plants that are transmitted by insects. These bacteria uniquely multiply intracellularly in both plants (Plantae) and insects (Animalia). Similarly to bacterial endosymbionts, phytoplasmas have reduced genomes with limited metabolic capabilities. Nonetheless, the chromosomes of many phytoplasmas are rich in repeated DNA consisting of mobile elements. Phytoplasmas produce an arsenal of effectors most of which are encoded on these mobile elements and on plasmids. These effectors target conserved plant transcription factors resulting in witches' broom and leafy flower symptoms and suppression of plant defense to insect vectors that transmit the phytoplasmas. Future studies of these fascinating microbes will generate a wealth of new knowledge about forces that shape genomes and microbial interactions with multicellular hosts. "
negative,"The distribution of microsatellites in the Nasonia parasitoid wasp genome. Microsatellites are important molecular markers used in numerous genetic contexts. Despite this widespread use, the evolutionary processes governing microsatellite distribution and diversity remain controversial. Here, we present results on the distribution of microsatellites of three species in the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia generated by an in silico data-mining approach. Our results show that the overall microsatellite density in Nasonia is comparable to that of the honey bee, but much higher than in eight non-Hymenopteran arthropods. Across the Nasonia vitripennis genome, microsatellite density varied both within and amongst chromosomes. In contrast to other taxa, dinucleotides are the most abundant repeat type in all four species of Hymenoptera studied. Whether the differences between the Hymenoptera and other taxa are of functional significance remains to be determined. "
negative,"Transcriptome analysis in the beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis Fabricius, is a destructive pest on vegetable crops in tropics and subtropics; its main host plant is amaranth. It has become imperative to develop non-chemical methods to control S. recurvalis on amaranth. However, the lack of molecular information about this species has hindered the development of novel pest management strategies. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing covering de novo sequence assemblies, functional annotation of transcripts, gene function classification and enrichment was performed on S. recurvalis. Illumina sequencing generated a total of 120 435 transcript contigs ranging from 201 to 22 729 bases with a mean length of 688 bases. The assembled transcripts were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool-X (BLASTX) to obtain the annotations against non-redundant, Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) protein databases. A subset of 58 225 transcript sequences returned hits from known proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and the majority of the transcript sequences had the highest number of hits for Danaus plexippus (50.43%). A total of 1217 Gene Ontology-level 3 annotations were assigned to 51 805 transcripts, while 39 650 transcripts were predicted as functional protein-coding genes in the COG database and 20 037 transcripts were enriched to KEGG pathways. We identified 40 putative genes related to pheromone production and reception in S. recurvalis, with the expression of one gene between 0.29 and 1141.79 fragments per kilo base per million (FPKM) reads. The transcriptome sequence of S. recurvalis is a first step toward offering a comprehensive genomic resource which would enable better understanding of molecular mechanisms to enable development of effective pest management practices for this species.

negative,"Superinfection of five Wolbachia in the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) (Coleoptera: Curuculionidae). Wolbachia bacteria are among the most common endosymbionts in insects. In Wolbachia research, the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene has been used as a phylogenetic tool, but relationships inferred by single-locus analysis can be unreliable because of the extensive genome recombination among Wolbachia strains. Therefore, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method for Wolbachia, which relies upon a set of five conserved genes, is recommended. In this study, we examined whether the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford), is infected with Wolbachia using wsp and MLST genes. Wolbachia was detected from all tested specimens of X. germanus (n=120) by wsp amplification. Five distinct sequences (i.e. five alleles) for wsp were found, and labeled as wXge1-5. MLST analysis and molecular phylogeny of concatenated sequences of MLST genes identified wXge3 and wXge5 as closely-related strains. The detection rate of wXge4 and wXge1 was 100% and 63.3%, respectively; wXge2, wXge3 and wXge5 were detected from less than 15% of specimens. We performed mitochondrial haplotype analyses that identified three genetic types of X. germanus, i.e. Clades A, B and C. Wsp alleles wXge1, wXge2 and wXge4 were detected in all clade A beetles; wXge2 allele was absent from Clades B and C. We concluded that (i) five wsp alleles were found from X. germanus, (ii) use of MLST genes, rather than the wsp gene, are more suited to construct Wolbachia phylogenies and (iii) wsp alleles wXge2 and wXge3 / wXge5 would infect clade A and clade B / C of X. germanus, respectively.

negative,"Complete Genome Sequence of Bacillus bombysepticus, a Pathogen Leading to Bombyx mori Black Chest Septicemia. Bacillus bombysepticus is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium. Here, we announce the first complete genome sequence of this organism isolated from the cadavers of silkworm larvae that had been sick. The genome contains a single circular chromosome and a circular plasmid. Analyses of the B. bombysepticus genome will provide insights into its pathomechanisms and biology.  "
negative,"The complete mitogenome of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and comparison with other lepidopteran insects. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) was determined to be 15,653bp, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a A+T-rich region. It has the typical gene organization and order of mitogenomes from lepidopteran insects. The AT skew of this mitogenome was slightly positive and the nucleotide composition was also biased toward A+T nucleotides (81.31%). All PCGs were initiated by ATN codons, except for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene which was initiated by CGA. The cox1 and cox2 genes had incomplete stop codons consisting of just a T. All the tRNA genes displayed a typical clover-leaf structure of mitochondrial tRNA. The A+T-rich region of the mitogenome was 495bp in length and consisted of several features common to the lepidopteras. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the B. mori Dazao was close to Bombycidae. "
positive,"Downregulation of dystrophin expression in pupae of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci inhibits the emergence of adults. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a major pest to agriculture. Adults are able to fly for long distances and to colonize staple crops, herbs and ornamentals, and to vector viruses belonging to several important taxonomic groups. During their early development, whiteflies mature from eggs through several nymphal stages (instars I to IV) until adults emerge from pupae. We aim at reducing whitefly populations by inhibiting the emergence of adults from nymphs. Here we targeted dystrophin, a conserved protein essential for the development of the muscle system in humans, other animals and insects. We have exploited the fact that whitefly nymphs developing on tomato leaves feed from the plant phloem via their stylets. Thus, we delivered dystrophin-silencing double-stranded RNA to nymphs developing on leaves of tomato plantlets with their roots bathing in the silencing solution. Downregulation of dystrophin expression occurred mainly in pupae. Dystrophin silencing induced also the downregulation of the dystrophin-associated protein genes actin and tropomyosin, and disrupted F-actin. Most significantly, the treatment inhibited the emergence of adults from pupae, suggesting that targeting dystrophin may help to restrain whitefly populations. This study demonstrates for the first time the important role of dystrophin in the development of a major insect pest to agriculture. "
negative,"Ecdysteroid-mediated expression of hexamerin (arylphorin) in the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The insect development is intricately controlled by morphogenetic hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) through the regulation of gene / protein expression. The role of hexamerins in the metamorphosis of insects and reproduction and their control by 20E at the gene level has been widely reported in insects. In the present study we for the first time report the role of ecdysteroids in the regulation of hexamerin synthesis in a lepidopteran insect Corcyra cephalonica. The hormonal studies were carried out using the normal and the thorax-ligated insects with both 20E and its non-steroidal agonist RH-5992. The in vitro as well as in vivo studies showed a stimulatory effect of 20E and its agonist on the hexamerin synthesis including arylphorin (Hex 2), whereas hormone blockade with azadirachtin caused a time dependent reduction in synthesis. The northern analysis using Hex 2b cDNA as probe too confirmed the above result. This was followed by the cloning of the Hex 2b gene. The full length of the genomic clone was found to be 3.5kb long and has four exons interspersed by three introns. The genome walking analysis revealed the presence of a steroid hormone binding sequence ""Ecdysone response element"" (EcRE) in the 5' untranscribed region (UTR) of the gene. The data presented in this paper clearly suggest that hexamerin synthesis in C. cephalonica is transcriptionally regulated by 20E. "
negative,"Morphological and genomic characterization of the polydnavirus associated with the parasitoid wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Glyptapanteles indiensis polydnavirus (GiPDV) is essential for successful parasitization of the larval stage of the lepidopteran Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) by the endoparasitic wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis. This virus has not been characterized previously. Ultrastructural studies of GiPDV showed that virions had a rod-like or rectangular form and each contained as many as ten nucleocapsids enclosed by a single unit membrane envelope. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) analysis of the virus genomic DNA revealed that GiPDV had a segmented genome composed of 13 dsDNA segments, ranging in size from approximately 11 kb to more than 30 kb. Four genomic segments were present in higher molar concentration than the others. Further characterization of the GiPDV genome yielded several cDNA clones which derived from GiPDV-specific mRNAs, and Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of isolated cDNA clones in the parasitized host. Each was present on more than one GiPDV genomic DNA segment, suggesting the existence of related sequences among DNA segments. It has been proposed previously that in polydnavirus systems, genome segmentation, hypermolar ratio segments and segment nesting may function to increase the copy number of essential genes and to increase the levels of gene expression in the absence of virus replication. The present data support this notion and suggest that GiPDV morphology and genomic organization may be intrinsically linked to the function and evolutionary strategies of the virus. "
negative,"Insect symbionts as valuable grist for the biotechnological mill: an alkaliphilic silkworm gut bacterium for efficient lactic acid production. Insects constitute the most abundant and diverse animal class and act as hosts to an extraordinary variety of symbiotic microorganisms. These microbes living inside the insects play critical roles in host biology and are also valuable bioresources. Enterococcus mundtii EMB156, isolated from the larval gut (gut pH >10) of the model organism Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), efficiently produces lactic acid, an important metabolite for industrial production of bioplastic materials. E. mundtii EMB156 grows well under alkaline conditions and stably converts various carbon sources into lactic acid, offering advantages in downstream fermentative processes. High-yield lactic acid production can be achieved by the strain EMB156 from renewable biomass substrates under alkaline pretreatments. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology revealed its 3.01 Mbp whole genome sequence. A total of 2956 protein-coding sequences, 65 tRNA genes, and 6 rRNA operons were predicted in the EMB156 chromosome. Remarkable genomic features responsible for lactic acid fermentation included key enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate (PP) / glycolytic pathway, and an alpha amylase and xylose isomerase were characterized in EMB156. This genomic information coincides with the phenotype of E. mundtii EMB156, reflecting its metabolic flexibility in efficient lactate fermentation, and established a foundation for future biotechnological application. Interestingly, enzyme activities of amylase were quite stable in high-pH broths, indicating a possible mechanism for strong EMB156 growth in an alkaline environment, thereby facilitating lactic acid production. Together, these findings implied that valuable lactic acid-producing bacteria can be discovered efficiently by screening under the extremely alkaline conditions, as exemplified by gut microbial symbionts of Lepidoptera insects. "
negative,"Midgut and salivary gland transcriptomes of the arbovirus vector Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Numerous Culicoides spp. are important vectors of livestock or human disease pathogens. Transcriptome information from midguts and salivary glands of adult female Culicoides sonorensis provides new insight into vector biology. Of 1719 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from adult serum-fed female midguts harvested within 5 h of feeding, twenty-eight clusters of serine proteases were derived. Four clusters encode putative iron binding proteins (FER1, FERL, PXDL1, PXDL2), and two clusters encode metalloendopeptidases (MDP6C, MDP6D) that probably function in bloodmeal catabolism. In addition, a diverse variety of housekeeping cDNAs were identified. Selected midgut protease transcripts were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR): TRY1_115 and MDP6C mRNAs were induced in adult female midguts upon feeding, whereas TRY1_156 and CHYM1 were abundant in midguts both before and immediately after feeding. Of 708 salivary gland ESTs analysed, clusters representing two new classes of protein families were identified: a new class of D7 proteins and a new class of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. Additional cDNAs representing putative immunomodulatory proteins were also identified: 5' nucleotidases, antigen 5-related proteins, a hyaluronidase, a platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, mucins and several immune response cDNAs. Analysis by q-PCR showed that all D7 and Kunitz domain transcripts tested were highly enriched in female heads compared with other tissues and were generally absent from males. The mRNAs of two additional protease inhibitors, TFPI1 and TFPI2, were detected in salivary glands of paraffin-embedded females by in situ hybridization. "
negative,"Behavioral and genomic characterization of molt-sleep in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. During the transition from feeding to molting, larval insects undergo profound changes in behavior and patterns of gene expression regulated by the neuroendocrine system. For some species, a distinctive characteristic of molting larvae is presence of a quiescent state sometimes referred to as ""molt-sleep"". Here, observations of 4th instar Manduca sexta larvae indicate the molting period involves a predominantly quiescent state that shares behavioral properties of adult insect sleep in that it is rapidly reversible and accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to both mildly arousing and noxious stimuli. When subjected to noxious stimuli, molting larvae exhibit locomotory and avoidance behaviors similar to those of inter-molt larvae. Although less consolidated, inter-molt quiescence shares many of the same behavioral traits with molting quiescence. However, when subjected to deprivation of quiescence, inter-molt larvae display a compensatory rebound behavior that is not detected in molting larvae. This suggests that molting quiescence is a specialized form of inactivity that affords survival advantages to molting larvae. RNA-seq analysis of molting larvae shows general reduction in expression of genes encoding GPCRs and down regulation of genes connected with cyclic nucleotide signaling. On the other hand, certain ion channel genes are up-regulated, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, chloride channels and a voltage-dependent calcium channel. These findings suggest patterns of gene expression consistent with elevation of quiescent state characteristic of the molt in a model holometabolous insect.  "
negative,"An expansion of the dual clip-domain serine proteinase family in Manduca sexta: gene organization, expression, and evolution of prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-2, hemolymph proteinase 12, and other related proteinases. Prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases (PAPs) take part in insect defense responses including melanotic encapsulation and wound healing. To understand their gene structure and regulation, we screened a genomic library and isolated overlapping lambda clones for Manduca sexta PAP-2, hemolymph proteinase 12 (HP12), and HP24. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that all three genes encode polypeptides with two regulatory clip domains at the amino terminus, a linker region, and a catalytic serine proteinase domain at the carboxyl terminus. Each gene contains eight exons, with introns located at equivalent positions. Similar sequences are present in introns as well as exons, indicating that these genes arose from recent gene duplication and sequence divergence. We analyzed their 5' flanking sequences and identified putative immune and hormone responsive elements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions confirmed that PAP-2 and HP12 mRNA levels in the larval fat body and hemocytes increased after a bacterial challenge. However, HP24 expression was barely detected. PAP-2 transcripts in cultured fat body became less abundant after 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. Thus, PAP-2, HP12, and HP24 mRNA levels are differentially regulated by immune and developmental signals. Comparison with HP15, HP23, and PAP-3 sequences suggested an evolutionary pathway of the dual clip-domain serine proteinases in M. sexta. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Ceratitis capitata has been determined. The circular genome is 15 980 bp long and contains a standard gene complement, i.e. the large and small ribosomal RNA subunits, twenty-two transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and thirteen genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. When comparing the sequence to fragments previously sequenced from other isolates it becomes apparent that interstrain polymorphisms are not rare. These differences are potentially useful for the development of diagnostic tools for population analysis applications, such as determining the source of recent introductions. Moreover, they could help obtain a solution to the long-lasting controversy on the possible eradication of the Medfly from certain locations. "
negative,"Stimulation of polydnavirus replication by 20-hydroxyecdysone. During oviposition the endoparasitic wasp Campoletis sonorensis, introduces a polydnavirus into parasitized insects where viral gene expression is required for endoparasite survival. The polydnavirus is integrated into wasp chromosomal DNA and replicates only in the ovary. Ecdysteroids regulate the developmental expression of many insect genes and may regulate polydnavirus replication. Direct verification of viral replication was performed by dot blot hybridization and by amplifying DNA sequences containing the viral integration site; this 'junction' fragment cannot be amplified from integrated virus. Thoracic ligations and in vitro ecdysteroid treatments of wasp ovaries support the hypothesis that polydnavirus DNA replication is regulated by ecdysteroid during parasite development. "
negative,"Insect herbivory elicits genome-wide alternative splicing responses in Nicotiana attenuata. Changes in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) are involved in many responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in eukaryotic organisms. In response to attack and oviposition by insect herbivores, plants elicit rapid changes in gene expression which are essential for the activation of plant defenses; however, the herbivory-induced changes in AS remain unstudied. Using mRNA sequencing, we performed a genome-wide analysis on tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) feeding-induced AS in both leaves and roots of Nicotiana attenuata. Feeding by M. sexta for 5 h reduced total AS events by 7.3% in leaves but increased them in roots by 8.0% and significantly changed AS patterns in leaves and roots of existing AS genes. Feeding by M. sexta also resulted in increased (in roots) and decreased (in leaves) transcript levels of the serine / arginine-rich (SR) proteins that are involved in the AS machinery of plants and induced changes in SR gene expression that were jasmonic acid (JA)-independent in leaves but JA-dependent in roots. Changes in AS and gene expression elicited by M. sexta feeding were regulated independently in both tissues. This study provides genome-wide evidence that insect herbivory induces changes not only in the levels of gene expression but also in their splicing, which might contribute to defense against and / or tolerance of herbivory.  "
negative,"Reliable protocols for whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum: a comprehensive survey and analysis. RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), including chromogenic ISH (CISH) and fluorescent ISH (FISH), has become a powerful tool for revealing the spatial distribution of gene transcripts in model organisms. Previously, we developed a robust protocol for whole-mount RNA CISH in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, an emerging insect genomic model. In order to improve the resolving capacity of gene detection, we comprehensively surveyed current protocols of whole-mount RNA-FISH and developed protocols that allow, using confocal microscopy, clearer visualization of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) - including those subcellularly localized and those with spatially overlapping expression. We find that Fast dye-based substrate fluorescence (SF), tyramide signal amplification (TSA), and TSA Plus all enable identifying gene expression thanks to multiplex amplification of fluorescent signals. By contrast, methods of direct fluorescence (DF) do not allow visualizing signals. Detection of a single gene target was achieved with SF and TSA Plus for most mRNAs, whereas TSA only allowed visualization of abundant transcripts such as Apvas1 and Appiwi2 in the germ cells. For detection of multiple gene targets using double FISH, we recommend: (i) TSA / TSA, rather than TSA Plus / TSA Plus for colocalized mRNAs abundantly expressed in germ cells, as proteinase K treatment can be omitted; and (ii) SF / TSA Plus for other gene targets such as Apen1 and Apen2 as inactivation of enzyme conjugates is not required. SF / SF is not ideal for double FISH experiments due to signal blurring. Based on these new conditions for RNA-FISH, we have obtained a better understanding of germline specification and embryonic segmentation in the pea aphid. We anticipate that the RNA-FISH protocols for the pea aphid may also be used for other aphids and possibly other insect species, thus expanding the range of species from which useful insights into development and evolution may be obtained.  "
negative,"The Bear Giant-Skipper genome suggests genetic adaptations to living inside yucca roots. Giant-Skippers (Megathymini) are unusual thick-bodied, moth-like butterflies whose caterpillars feed inside Yucca roots and Agave leaves. Giant-Skippers are attributed to the subfamily Hesperiinae and they are endemic to southern and mostly desert regions of the North American continent. To shed light on the genotypic determinants of their unusual phenotypic traits, we sequenced and annotated a draft genome of the largest Giant-Skipper species, the Bear (Megathymus ursus violae). The Bear skipper genome is the least heterozygous among sequenced Lepidoptera genomes, possibly due to much smaller population size and extensive inbreeding. Their lower heterozygosity helped us to obtain a high-quality genome with an N50 of 4.2 Mbp. The ~ 430 Mb genome encodes about 14000 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis supports placement of Giant-Skippers with Grass-Skippers (Hesperiinae). We find that proteins involved in odorant and taste sensing as well as in oxidative reactions have diverged significantly in Megathymus as compared to Lerema, another Grass-Skipper. In addition, the Giant-Skipper has lost several odorant and gustatory receptors and possesses many fewer (1 / 3-1 / 2 of other skippers) anti-oxidative enzymes. Such differences may be related to the unusual life style of Giant-Skippers: they do not feed as adults, and their caterpillars feed inside Yuccas and Agaves, which provide a source of antioxidants such as polyphenols. "
positive,"Isolation and expression analysis of a homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon gene in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. A full-length 14-3-3 gene homolog (also referred to as the Px14-3-3 epsilon ""ε"" or Px14-3-3ε gene) was cloned from cDNA of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Px14-3-3 transcript is 789 nucleotides in length, and the predicted polypeptide is 263 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The Px14-3-3 gene contains the typical and predicted 14-3-3 domains and motifs. The amino acid sequence of the diamondback moth 14-3-3 gene is very similar to that of other insect epsilons (ε) but not to other insect zetas (ζ). In particular, the protein sequence of the Px14-3-3 gene shows high identity to the Bombyx mori epsilon (96.2%). Western blot analysis using an antibody against Px14-3-3ε verified the expression of 14-3-3ε in the larval, pupal, and adult stages. The Px14-3-3ε expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth instar larvae. Px14-3-3ε was detected in every tissue examined, including the body fat, hemocytes, brain, gut, and cuticle. "
negative,"A new mapping method for quantitative trait loci of silkworm. BACKGROUND: Silkworm is the basis of sericultural industry and the model organism in insect genetics study. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying economically important traits of silkworm is of high significance for promoting the silkworm molecular breeding and advancing our knowledge on genetic architecture of the Lepidoptera. Yet, the currently used mapping methods are not well suitable for silkworm, because of ignoring the recombination difference in meiosis between two sexes. RESULTS: A mixed linear model including QTL main effects, epistatic effects, and QTL × sex interaction effects was proposed for mapping QTLs in an F2 population of silkworm. The number and positions of QTLs were determined by F-test and model selection. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to estimate and test genetic effects of QTLs and QTL × sex interaction effects. The effectiveness of the model and statistical method was validated by a series of simulations. The results indicate that when markers are distributed sparsely on chromosomes, our method will substantially improve estimation accuracy as compared to the normal chiasmate F2 model. We also found that a sample size of hundreds was sufficiently large to unbiasedly estimate all the four types of epistases (i.e., additive-additive, additive-dominance, dominance-additive, and dominance-dominance) when the paired QTLs reside on different chromosomes in silkworm. CONCLUSION: The proposed method could accurately estimate not only the additive, dominance and digenic epistatic effects but also their interaction effects with sex, correcting the potential bias and precision loss in the current QTL mapping practice of silkworm and thus representing an important addition to the arsenal of QTL mapping tools. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome characteristics of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) and comparation with other Noctuoidea insects. In this study, mitogenome of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) were sequenced and compared with other Noctuoidea species. The mitogenome is 15,410 base pairs in length. All 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) are initiated by ATN codons except cox1 with CGA and all of PCGs terminate with TAA except nad4 with TAG. The codons ACG and CGC are absent. All the tRNA genes could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure except the trnS1 which not only loses dihydrouridine (DHU) arm but also mutates its anticodon into TCT. In the AT-rich region of the mitogenome the motif 'ATAGA' mutates to 'ATATA' and two copies of 161 bp-tandem repeats and two 'TA' short tandem repeats are founded. Phylogenetic analyses showed that S. scintillans is clustered into subfamily Lymatriinae. The phylogenetic relationships within Noctuoidea is (((Nolidae + (Euteliidae + Noctuidae)) + Erebidae) + Notodontidae). "
positive,"Isolation and molecular characterization of Musca domestica delta-9 desaturase sequences. We have isolated fatty acyl-CoA desaturase cDNA (Mdomd9) and genomic sequences from the housefly, Musca domestica. Two approximately 1.66 kb cDNAs were recovered. They had identical coding regions and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but differed in their 5' UTRs. The open reading frame encodes a 380 amino acid (aa) protein with 82% identity to Drosophila melanogaster desat1, and significant (> 50%) identity with other insect delta-9 desaturases. Functional analyses in a yeast expression system confirmed the cDNA encodes a delta9 desaturase. Northern analysis indicated two transcripts of 1.7 and 2.9 kb that hybridized specifically to the open reading frame. PCR amplification of genomic templates revealed three intron sites that are conserved among other insect species. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicated at least two desaturase gene copies per haploid genome. There is a high degree of polymorphism, most of which appears to be due to variable intron sequences; curiously, individual flies had varying morphs of intron II and intron III. Together, the data suggest that there are more delta9 desaturase alleles within the population studied than there are loci within the genome, and support other studies suggesting that insect fatty acyl-CoA desaturases are a dynamically evolving gene family. "
negative,"A molecular and genomic reference system for conifer defence against insects. Insect pests are part of natural forest ecosystems contributing to forest rejuvenation but can also cause ecological disturbance and economic losses that are expected to increase with climate change. The white pine or spruce weevil (Pissodes strobi) is a pest of conifer forests in North America. Weevil-host interactions with various spruce (Picea) species have been explored as a genomic and molecular reference system for conifer defence against insects. Interactions occur in two major phases of the insect life cycle. In the exophase, adult weevils are free-moving and display behaviour of host selection for oviposition that is affected by host traits. In the endophase, insects live within the host where mobility and development from eggs to young adults are affected by a complex system of host defences. Genetic resistance exists in several spruce species and involves synergism of constitutive and induced chemical and physical defences that comprise the conifer defence syndrome. Here, we review conifer defences that disrupt the weevil life cycle and mechanisms by which trees resist weevil attack. We highlight molecular and genomic aspects and a possible role for the weevil microbiome. Knowledge of this conifer defence system is supporting forest health strategies and tree breeding for insect resistance. "
negative,"Characterization of Adult Transcriptomes from the Omnivorous Lady Beetle Coleomegilla maculata Fed Pollen or Insect Egg Diet. Diet, nutrition, and obesity are important topics of current research. While many insect genome and / or transcriptome models are based on dietary specialists, the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata, a common New World species, is highly omnivorous. C. maculata feeds on plants, fungi, insects and other arthropods; its diet frequently includes conspecific cannibalism. This study reports and discusses the first nutritionally based C. maculata transcriptomes. These transcriptomes were prepared from highly inbred specimens provided limited diets, after adult eclosion, of either pollen only or eggs of a soft bodied hemipteran insect only. Selected sequences from the transcriptomes were compared to verify basic genetic similarity of the sampled individuals. Differentially expressed genes associated with these diets were identified to aid with studies of omnivore diet and nutrition. Selected transcriptome sequences described herein are filed with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), GenBank Bioproject PRJNA236444.  "
negative,"Power, resolution and bias: recent advances in insect phylogeny driven by the genomic revolution. Our understanding on the phylogenetic relationships of insects has been revolutionised in the last decade by the proliferation of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS). NGS has allowed insect systematists to assemble very large molecular datasets that include both model and non-model organisms. Such datasets often include a large proportion of the total number of protein coding sequences available for phylogenetic comparison. We review some early entomological phylogenomic studies that employ a range of different data sampling protocols and analyses strategies, illustrating a fundamental renaissance in our understanding of insect evolution all driven by the genomic revolution. The analysis of phylogenomic datasets is challenging because of their size and complexity, and it is obvious that the increasing size alone does not ensure that phylogenetic signal overcomes systematic biases in the data. Biases can be due to various factors such as the method of data generation and assembly, or intrinsic biological feature of the data per se, such as similarities due to saturation or compositional heterogeneity. Such biases often cause violations in the underlying assumptions of phylogenetic models. We review some of the bioinformatics tools available and being developed to detect and minimise systematic biases in phylogenomic datasets. Phylogenomic-scale data coupled with sophisticated analyses will revolutionise our understanding of insect functional genomics. This will illuminate the relationship between the vast range of insect phenotypic diversity and underlying genetic diversity. In combination with rapidly developing methods to estimate divergence times, these analyses will also provide a compelling view of the rates and patterns of lineagenesis (birth of lineages) over the half billion years of insect evolution. "
positive,"Environmental dissemination of mcr-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae by Chrysomya spp. (common blowfly): An increasing public health risk. Until recently, the role of insects, and particularly flies, in disseminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been poorly studied. In this study, we screened blowflies (Chrysomya spp.) from different areas near the city of Phitsanulok, Northern Thailand, for the presence of AMR genes and in particular, mcr-1, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). In total, 48 mcr-1-positive isolates were recovered, consisting of 17 mcr-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (MCRPKP) and 31 mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) strains. The 17 MCRPKP were shown to be clonal (ST43) with few single poly nucleomorphs (SNPs) by WGS analysis. In in-vitro models, the MCRPKP were shown to be highly virulent. In contrast, 31 recovered MCRPEC isolates are varied, belonging to 12 different sequence types shared with those causing human infections. The majority of mcr-1 gene are located on IncX4 plasmids (29 / 48, 60.42%), sharing an identical plasmid backbone. These findings highlight the contribution of flies to the AMR contagion picture in low- and middle-income countries and the challenges of tackling global AMR. "
positive,"The insect ecdysone receptor is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control. RNA interference (RNAi) has great potential for use in insect pest control. However, some significant challenges must be overcome before RNAi-based pest control can become a reality. One challenge is the proper selection of a good target gene for RNAi. Here, we report that the insect ecdysone receptor (EcR) is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a serious insect pest of rice plants. We demonstrated that the use of a 360 bp fragment (NlEcR-c) that is common between NlEcR-A and NlEcR-B for feeding RNAi experiments significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of NlEcR compared with those in the dsGFP control. Feeding RNAi also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of offspring per pair of N. lugens. Consequently, a transgenic rice line expressing NlEcR dsRNA was constructed by Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the total copy number of the target gene in all transgenic rice lines was 2. Northern blot analysis showed that the small RNA of the hairpin dsNlEcR-c was successfully expressed in the transgenic rice lines. After newly hatched nymphs of N. lugens fed on the transgenic rice lines, effective RNAi was observed. The NlEcR expression levels in all lines examined were decreased significantly compared with the control. In all lines, the survival rate of the nymphs was nearly 90%, and the average number of offspring per pair in the treated groups was significantly less than that observed in the control, with a decrease of 44.18-66.27%. These findings support an RNAi-based pest control strategy and are also important for the management of rice insect pests.  "
negative,"Genome-wide patterns of polymorphism in an inbred line of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Anopheles gambiae is a major mosquito vector of malaria in Africa. Although increased use of insecticide-based vector control tools has decreased malaria transmission, elimination is likely to require novel genetic control strategies. It can be argued that the absence of an A. gambiae inbred line has slowed progress toward genetic vector control. In order to empower genetic studies and enable precise and reproducible experimentation, we set out to create an inbred line of this species. We found that amenability to inbreeding varied between populations of A. gambiae. After full-sib inbreeding for ten generations, we genotyped 112 individuals--56 saved prior to inbreeding and 56 collected after inbreeding--at a genome-wide panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although inbreeding dramatically reduced diversity across much of the genome, we discovered numerous, discrete genomic blocks that maintained high heterozygosity. For one large genomic region, we were able to definitively show that high diversity is due to the persistent polymorphism of a chromosomal inversion. Inbred lines in other eukaryotes often exhibit a qualitatively similar retention of polymorphism when typed at a small number of markers. Our whole-genome SNP data provide the first strong, empirical evidence supporting associative overdominance as the mechanism maintaining higher than expected diversity in inbred lines. Although creation of A. gambiae lines devoid of nearly all polymorphism may not be feasible, our results provide critical insights into how more fully isogenic lines can be created. "
positive,"Systemic RNAi of V-ATPase subunit B causes molting defect and developmental abnormalities in Periplaneta fuliginosa. The vacuolar (H+ )-ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven proton pumps with multiple functions in many organisms. In this study, we performed structural and functional analysis of vha55 gene that encodes V-ATPase subunit B in the smokybrown cockroach Periplaneta fuliginosa (Blattodea). We observed a high homology score of the deduced amino acid sequences between 10 species in seven orders. RNAi of the vha55 gene in P. fuliginosa caused nymphal / nymphal molting defects with incomplete shedding of old cuticles, growth inhibition, as well as bent and wrinkled cuticles of thoraxes and abdominal segments. Since growth inhibition caused by vha55 RNAi did not interfere in the commencement of cockroach molting, molting timing and body growth might be controlled by independent mechanism. Our study suggested V-ATPases might be a good candidate molecule for evolutionary and developmental studies of insect molting. "
negative,"First genome analysis and molecular characterization of Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus Egyptian isolate infecting squash. This study aims to identifying and characterizing some molecular properties of geminiviruses co-infection in squash field crop cultivated in Egypt. Squash crops observed to be heavily infected with several insect vectors, also severe chlorosis and stunting was observed. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed geminate capsid particles which indicate the infection of Geminiviruses, especially SqLCV which represent an economic problem to squash filed crop in Egypt. We have investigated possible mixed infections with different plant viruses associated with chlorotic stunt diseases and or other genus groups of geminiviruses. The main objective of this study is to investigate the recombination events, possible recombinants and variants among these genera in the same family differing in vector transmission. This is the first report of the molecular characterization, phylogenetic analysis and putative recombination events of the full length genome of the Chickpea Chlorotic Dwarf Mastrevirus in Egypt. And the first report of co-infection with another begomovirus infecting squash plants. A full length clone of both viruses were isolated and characterized at the molecular level. The complete nucleotide sequence of DNA-A was determined (2,572 bp) and submitted to the genbank under accession no. KF692356. The isolate from Egypt has about 97.8 % homology with the Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV) isolate from Syria DNA-A isolate FR687959, a 83.2 % homology with the Sudan isolate AM933134 and a 82.7 % homology with Pakistan isolate FR687960. To best of our knowledge this is the first report of complete genome of CpCDV that infect squash plants in Egypt and worldwide.  "
positive,"Identification, expression and function of myosin heavy chain family genes in Tribolium castaneum. Functions of myosin heavy chain (myosin) family genes are poorly understood in some insects. To address this, we determined the expression and function of myosin family genes in Tribolium castaneum. TcMyo15 is predominantly expressed in early embryos, late larvae and early adults, but TcMyo7B transcripts significantly increased in late larvae. TcMyo20 transcripts are abundant in pre-adults, whereas TcMhc1 is highly expressed in post-embryonic stages. TcMhc2 shows peak expression in late pupae. TcMyo9 transcripts reached their highest levels in late pupae. TcMyo15, TcMyo7B and TcMhc2 are abundantly expressed in the adult epidermis, gut and testis, respectively. TcMyo9 and TcMyo20 are highly expressed in the epidermis, fat body and ovary, and TcMhc1 exhibits high mRNA levels in the epidermis and accessory gland. TcMyo20 RNAi reduced wing and leg size, fertility and egg hatchability. TcMyo9 knockdown completely inhibited eclosion and fecundity, but TcMyo15 or TcMhc1 silencing only impaired eclosion. TcMhc2 RNAi affected pupation and wing development. This study suggests myosin genes as potential targets of pesticides due to their critical roles in insect development and reproduction. "
negative,"Beet poleroviruses: close friends or distant relatives? UNLABELLED: SUMMARY Taxonomy: There are three members of the genus Polerovirus (family Luteoviridae) that induce yellowing of sugar beet: Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV), Beet chlorosis virus (BChV) and Beet western yellows virus-USA (BWYV-USA, Fig. 1). Non-beet-infecting isolates of BWYV found particularly within Europe have now been re-named Turnip yellows virus (TuYV). Species-specific antibodies are unavailable, but the viruses can be distinguished by RT-PCR using primers specifically designed to the 5' end of their respective genomes. Physical properties: The isometric virus particles are approximately 26 nm in diameter and the genome consists of a single strand of positive sense RNA that utilizes almost all known plant virus gene expression strategies (initiation bypass, translational frameshifting and readthrough, synthesis of subgenomic RNA and proteolytic processing). HOST RANGE: Many members of the Chenopodiaceae are susceptible, including commercial crops of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), red beet and spinach. Experimental hosts include Montia perfoliata, Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. SYMPTOMS: Sugar beet infected with beet poleroviruses show patches of chlorosis on the older leaves 4-6 weeks post-infection; these areas expand until the whole leaf becomes yellow and older leaves then tend to thicken and become brittle. TRANSMISSION: Beet poleroviruses are transmitted in a persistent (circulative, non-propagative) manner by several different aphid species, Myzus persicae being the most important vector. "
negative,"Analysis of ESTs from Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies and their contribution toward understanding the insect-parasite relationship. An expressed sequence tag library has been generated from a sand fly vector of visceral leishmaniasis, Lutzomyia longipalpis. A normalized cDNA library was constructed from whole adults and 16,608 clones were sequenced from both ends and assembled into 10,203 contigs and singlets. Of these 58% showed significant similarity to known genes from other organisms, <4% were identical to described sand fly genes, and 42% had no match to any database sequence. Our analyses revealed putative proteins involved in the barrier function of the gut (peritrophins, microvillar proteins, glutamine synthase), digestive physiology (secreted and membrane-anchored hydrolytic enzymes), and the immune response (gram-negative binding proteins, thioester proteins, scavenger receptors, galectins, signaling pathway factors, caspases, serpins, and peroxidases). Sequence analysis of this transcriptome dataset has provided new insights into genes that might be associated with the response of the vector to the development of Leishmania. "
positive,"An Overview of Embryogenesis: External Morphology and Transcriptome Profiling in the Hemipteran Insect Nilaparvata lugens. During embryogenesis of insects, the morphological and transcriptional changes are important signatures to obtain a better understanding of insect patterning and evolution. The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is a serious insect pest of rice plants, but its embryogenesis has not uncovered. Here, we described embryonic development process of the pest and found it belongs to an intermediate-germ mode. The RNA-seq data from different times (6, 30, 96, and 150 h, after egg laying) of embryogenesis were then analyzed, and a total of 10,895 genes were determined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on pairwise comparisons. Afterward, 1,898 genes, differentially expressed in at least two comparisons of adjacent embryonic stages were divided into 10 clusters using K means cluster analysis (KMCA). Eight-gene modules were established using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression patterns in the different embryonic stages were identified by combining the functional enrichments of the stage-specific clusters and modules, which displayed the expression level and reprogramming of multiple developmental genes during embryogenesis. The ""hub"" genes at each embryonic stage with possible crucial roles were identified. Notably, we found a ""center"" set of genes that were related to overall membrane functions and might play important roles in the embryogenesis process. After parental RNAi of the MSTRG.3372, the hub gene, the embryo was observed as abnormal. Furthermore, some homologous genes in classic embryonic development processes and signaling pathways were also involved in embryogenesis of this insect. An improved comprehensive finding of embryogenesis within the N. lugens reveals better information on genetic and genomic studies of embryonic development and might be a potential target for RNAi-based control of this insect pest. "
positive,"Evaluation of potential RNA-interference-target genes to control cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcuidae). RNA interference (RNAi) of vital insect genes is a potential tool for targeted pest control. However, selection of the right target genes is a challenge because the RNAi efficacy is known to vary among insect species. Cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis, is a phloem-feeding economically important crop pest. We evaluated the RNAi of 2 vital genes, Bursicon (PsBur) and V-ATPase (PsV-ATPase) as potential targets in P. solenopsis for its control. PCR fragments of PsBur and PsV-ATPase were amplified using cDNA synthesized from the total RNA. The PCR amplicons were cloned into Potato virus X (PVX) to develop recombinant PVX for the inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum plants for bioassays with healthy P. solenopsis. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the expression of transgenes in the recombinant-PVX-inoculated plants (treated), and suppression of the target genes in the mealybugs exposed to them. The RT-PCR confirmed the expression of transgenes in the treated plants. Mealybug individuals on treated plants either died or showed physical deformities. Further, the population of mealybug was significantly reduced by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggers against PsBur and PsV-ATPase. The results conclude that RNAi is activated in P. solenopsis by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggering elements of PsBur and PsV-ATPase genes through recombinant PVX vector. Further, V-ATPase and Bursicon genes are potential targets for RNAi-mediated control of P. solenopsis. "
negative,"EST-based gene indices for the cattle fever tick, the horn fly, and the screwworm fly. The southern cattle tick, Rhip,cephalus (Boophilus) microplus, the horn fly, Haematobia irritans, and the New World screwworm, Cochl,omyia hominivorax, are economically important parasites of cattle throughout the world. Understanding the biology and genomics of these pests is critical to developing novel control methods. We developed EST sequence databases for these parasites and used bioinformatic analysis to identify conceptual open reading frames and assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms to those database transcripts that had informative BlasIX hits. Bloinformatic analysis showed that a large fraction of the tick database entries have no clear matches in other sequenced genomes. Several putative tick G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified that mightserve as starting points to develop novel control technologies. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of odorant-binding proteins in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. Olfaction contributes to many crucial behaviors in insects, such as foraging, locating hosts, mating, and avoiding predators. In the first step of the olfaction process in insects, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) bind with the odorants and transport hydrophobic odorants. OBPs are also believed to accelerate the termination of the odorant response. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is one of the most destructive fruit-eating pests, causing enormous economic losses to the fruit and vegetable industry worldwide. However, information relating to the number, diversity, and expression patterns of OBPs still remains fragmented in this insect pest. Here, we attempted to identify the OBPs in B. dorsalis using genomic and transcriptomic information. In this study, we expanded the repository of B. dorsalis OBPs to 49. Phylogenetic analysis of BdorOBPs with other species revealed that these proteins grouped into four subfamilies. Furthermore, we determined the expression profiles in six body parts (namely, the legs, wings, antenna, cuticles of the head, thorax, and abdomen) and five internal tissues (namely, the fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubule, testis, and ovary). The results indicated that 21 BdorOBPs showed high expression levels in the antenna, legs, and head cuticles and may thus perform olfactory functions, which corroborates previous evidence. Two BdorOBPs were specifically expressed in the abdomen cuticles. Nineteen OBPs were highly expressed in the fat body, while four OBPs were highly expressed in the reproductive organs. This indicated that they may have physiological roles other than in chemoreception. In summary, our results contribute to the knowledge base of insect OBPs and provide a foundation for the further study of the molecular mechanisms of chemoreception in B. dorsalis. "
positive,"NlATG1 Gene Participates in Regulating Autophagy and Fission of Mitochondria in the Brown Planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Autophagy plays multiple roles in regulating various physiological processes in cells. However, we currently lack a systematic analysis of autophagy and the autophagy-related gene 1 ATG1 in the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), one of the most destructive of the insect pests of rice. In this study, the full-length cDNA of an autophagy-related gene, NlATG1, was cloned from BPH. Real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that this NlATG1 gene was expressed differently across developmental stages, at higher levels in nymphs but lower levels in adults. RNA interference with dsNlATG1 significantly decreased the mRNA level of the target gene to 14.6% at day 4 compared with that of the dsGFP control group. The survival of the dsNlATG1-treated group decreased significantly from day 4 onward, dropping to 48.3% on day 8. Examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that epithelial cells of the BPH's midgut in the dsNlATG1-treated group had less autophagic vacuoles than did the dsGFP control, and knockdown of NlATG1 clearly inhibited the starvation-induced autophagy response in this insect. RNA interference of NlATG1 upregulated the NlFis1 gene involved in mitochondrial fission, leading to reductions in mitochondrial width and area. Furthermore, knockdown of NlATG1 also decreased the ATP content and accumulation of glycogen. Together, these results demonstrate that the NlATG1 gene participates in regulating autophagy and fission of mitochondria in the brown planthopper, making it a potentially promising target for pest control given its key role in autophagy, including maintaining the normal structure and function of mitochondria. "
negative,"Abundant nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) in the Aedes aegypti genome. A portion of the Aedes aegypti mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene (ND4) was amplified using PCR with a 42 degrees C annealing temperature. Amplified fragments from individual mosquitoes were similar to ND4 but contained multiple segregating sites. We suspected that nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) exist in the Ae. aegypti genome. A BlastN search in VectorBase with the entire Ae. aegypti mitochondrial genome identified 233 NUMTs comprising 110 178 bp in 145 supercontigs. At a density of 0.080 bp / kb, this represents the second highest density of NUMTs in an insect genome and the highest in Diptera. Analyses of flanking sequences suggested that Ae. aegypti NUMTs arise through mtDNA leakage from damaged mitochondria followed by breakage and nonhomologous recombination, rather than through duplicative processes such as transposition or molecular drive. "
negative,"Genomic origins of insect sex chromosomes. Recent efforts to catalog the diversity of sex chromosome systems coupled with genome sequencing projects are adding a new level of resolution to our understanding of insect sex chromosome origins. Y-chromosome degeneration makes sequencing difficult and may erase homology so rapidly that their origins will often remain enigmatic. X-chromosome origins are better understood, but thus far prove to be remarkably labile, often lacking homology even among close relatives. Furthermore, evidence now suggests that differentiated X or Y-chromosomes may both revert to autosomal inheritance. Data for ZW systems is scarcer, but W and Y-chromosomes seem to share many characteristics. Limited evidence suggests that Z-chromosome homology is more conserved than X counterparts, but broader sampling of both sex chromosome systems is needed. "
negative,"Genomic consequences of background effects on scalloped mutant expressivity in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic background effects contribute to the phenotypic consequences of mutations and are pervasive across all domains of life that have been examined, yet little is known about how they modify genetic systems. In part this is due to the lack of tractable model systems that have been explicitly developed to study the genetic and evolutionary consequences of background effects. In this study we demonstrate that phenotypic expressivity of the scalloped(E3) (sd(E3)) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is background dependent and is the result of at least one major modifier segregating between two standard lab wild-type strains. We provide evidence that at least one of the modifiers is linked to the vestigial region and demonstrate that the background effects modify the spatial distribution of known sd target genes in a genotype-dependent manner. In addition, microarrays were used to examine the consequences of genetic background effects on the global transcriptome. Expression differences between wild-type strains were found to be as large as or larger than the effects of mutations with substantial phenotypic effects, and expression differences between wild type and mutant varied significantly between genetic backgrounds. Significantly, we demonstrate that the epistatic interaction between sd(E3) and an optomotor blind mutation is background dependent. The results are discussed within the context of developing a complex but more realistic view of the consequences of genetic background effects with respect to mutational analysis and studies of epistasis and cryptic genetic variation segregating in natural populations. "
positive,"Silencing of CYP6 and APN Genes Affects the Growth and Development of Rice Yellow Stem Borer, Scirpophaga incertulas. RNAi is a powerful tool to target the insect genes involved in host-pest interactions. Key insect genes are the choice for silencing to achieve pest derived resistance where resistance genes are not available in gene pool of host plant. In this study, an attempt was made to determine the effect of dsRNA designed from two genes Cytochrome P450 derivative (CYP6) and Aminopeptidase N (APN) of rice yellow stem borer (YSB) on growth and development of insect. The bioassays involved injection of chemically synthesized 5' FAM labeled 21-nt dsRNA into rice cut stems and allowing the larvae to feed on these stems which resulted in increased mortality and observed growth and development changes in larval length and weight compared with its untreated control at 12-15 days after treatment. These results were further supported by observing the reduction in transcripts expression of these genes in treated larvae. Fluorescence detection in treated larvae also proved that dsRNA was readily taken by larvae when fed on dsRNA treated stems. These results from the present study clearly show that YSB larvae fed on dsRNA designed from Cytochrome P450 and Aminopeptidase N has detrimental effect on larval growth and development. These genes can be deployed to develop YSB resistance in rice using RNAi approach.  "
negative,"Investigation of the contribution of RyR target-site mutations in diamide resistance by CRISPR / Cas9 genome modification in Drosophila. Diamide insecticides are used widely against lepidopteran pests, acting as potent activators of insect Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) and thus inducing muscle contraction and eventually death. However, resistant phenotypes have recently evolved in the field, associated with the emergence of target site resistance mutations (G4946E / V and I4790M). We investigated the frequency of the mutations found in a resistant population of Tuta absoluta from Greece (G4946V ~79% and I4790M ~21%) and the associated diamide resistance profile: there are very high levels of resistance against chlorantraniliprole (9329-fold) and flubendiamide (4969-fold), but moderate levels against cyantraniliprole (191-fold). To further investigate functionally the contribution of each mutation in the resistant phenotype, we used CRISPR / Cas9 to generate genome modified Drosophila carrying alternative allele combinations, and performed toxicity bioassays against all three diamides. Genome modified flies bearing the G4946V mutation exhibited high resistance ratios to flubendiamide (91.3-fold) and chlorantraniliprole (194.7-fold) when compared to cyantraniliprole (5.4-fold). Flies naturally wildtype for the I4790M mutation were moderately resistant to flubendiamide (15.3-fold) but significantly less resistant to chlorantraniliprole (7.5-fold), and cyantraniliprole (2.3-fold). These findings provide in vivo functional genetic confirmation for the role and relative contribution of RyR mutations in diamide resistance and suggest that the mutations confer subtle differences on the relative binding affinities of the three diamides at an overlapping binding site on the RyR protein. "
positive,"Genomic organization and regulation of three cecropin genes in Anopheles gambiae. Three cecropin genes (AgCecA-C) were identified from Anopheles gambiae, a major vector for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. These genes form a cluster with AgCecA and AgCecB positioned in opposite orientation, while AgCecC is downstream of AgCecA in the same direction. One intron is present in each of these three genes. Motif searches of promoter regions revealed elements that could be regulated by the NF-kappaB family of transcriptional regulators. The divergent promoter (1186 nucleotides in length) between CecA and CecB and the promoter for CecC were analysed by transfection in An. gambiae cell lines. Results showed that these promoters were up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide. The activity was further elevated when heat-inactivated microbes were used to challenge the cell line. At least one NF-kappaB site was required for inducible expression of both CecA and CecB. "
positive,"Cloning and characterization of a 70 kDa heat shock cognate gene (HSC70) from two species of Chironomus. In the present study we carried out the isolation and characterization of an HSC70 gene from two midges, Chironomus tentans and C. yoshimatsui. The HSC70 cDNAs are approximately 2424 (C. tentans) and 2464 bp (C. yoshimatsui) long, and contain 1950 and 1956 bp open reading frames, respectively. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of two introns in these genes. The 5' untranslated regions of the HSC70 genes are adenosine-rich, a feature found in inducible HSP70 genes. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences exhibit high identity with cytosolic HSC70s from other Dipterans. Northern hybridization indicated that HSC70 is expressed at all developmental stages, from embryo to adult, and Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of multiple HSP70 genes in Chironomus. "
negative,"Inheritance of resistance to acrinathrin in Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). BACKGROUND: The western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is an economically important pest. The genetic basis of acrinathrin resistance was investigated in WFT. RESULTS: The resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for acrinathrin resistance from a pool of thrips populations collected in Almeria (south-eastern Spain), showed a high resistance to acrinathrin (43-fold based on LC(50) values) compared with the laboratory susceptible strain. Mortality data from reciprocal crosses of resistant and susceptible thrips indicated that resistance was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects. Analysis of probit lines from the parental strains and reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was expressed as a codominant trait. To determine the number of genes involved, a direct test of monogenic inheritance based on the backcrosses suggested that resistance to acrinathrin was probably controlled by one locus. Another approach, which was based on phenotypic variances, showed n(E), or the minimum number of freely segregating genetic factors for the resistant strain, to be 0.79. CONCLUSION: The results showed that acrinathrin resistance in WFT was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects, and was expressed as a codominant trait, probably controlled by one locus. "
negative,"Molecular and genomic basis of volatile-mediated indirect defense against insects in rice. Rice plants fed on by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) caterpillars emit a blend of volatiles dominated by terpenoids. These volatiles were highly attractive to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Microarray analysis identified 196 rice genes whose expression was significantly upregulated by FAW feeding, 18 of which encode metabolic enzymes potentially involved in volatile biosynthesis. Significant induction of expression of seven of the 11 terpene synthase (TPS) genes identified through the microarray experiments was confirmd using real-time RT-PCR. Enzymes encoded by three TPS genes, Os02g02930, Os08g07100 and Os08g04500, were biochemically characterized. Os02g02930 was found to encode a monoterpene synthase producing the single product S-linalool, which is the most abundant volatile emitted from FAW-damaged rice plants. Both Os08g07100 and Os08g04500 were found to encode sesquiterpene synthases, each producing multiple products. These three enzymes are responsible for production of the majority of the terpenes released from FAW-damaged rice plants. In addition to TPS genes, several key genes in the upstream terpenoid pathways were also found to be upregulated by FAW feeding. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of FAW-induced volatiles and the corresponding volatile biosynthetic genes potentially involved in indirect defense in rice. Evolution of the genetic basis governing volatile terpenoid biosynthesis for indirect defense is discussed. "
positive,"Characterisation, analysis of expression and localisation of the opsin gene repertoire from the perspective of photoperiodism in the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Organisms exhibit a wide range of seasonal responses as adaptions to predictable annual changes in their environment. These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth's cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include floration, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain. Clear differences in expression patterns were found, thus relating opsin expression with the photoperiodic response. "
negative,"Identification of insect genes involved in baculovirus AcMNPV entry into insect cells. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is a model enveloped DNA virus that infects and replicates in lepidopteran insect cells, and can efficiently enter a wide variety of non-host cells. Budded virions of AcMNPV enter cells by endocytosis and traffic to the nucleus where the virus initiates gene expression and genome replication. While trafficking of nucleocapsids by actin propulsion has been studied in detail, other important components of trafficking during entry remain poorly understood. We used a recombinant AcMNPV virus expressing an EGFP reporter in combination with an RNAi screen in Drosophila DL1 cells, to identify host proteins involved in AcMNPV entry. The RNAi screen targeted 86 genes involved in vesicular trafficking, including genes coding for VPS and ESCRT proteins, Rab GTPases, Exocyst proteins, and Clathrin adaptor proteins. We identified 24 genes required for efficient virus entry and reporter expression, and 4 genes that appear to restrict virus entry. "
positive,"Metabolism of selected model substrates and insecticides by recombinant CYP6FD encoded by its gene predominately expressed in the brain of Locusta migratoria. The migratory locust, Locusta migartoria, is a major agricultural insect pest and its resistance to insecticides is becoming more prevalent. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are important enzymes for biotransformations of various endogenous and xenobiotic substances. These enzymes play a major role in developing insecticide resistance in many insect species. In this study, we heterologously co-expressed a CYP enzyme (CYP6FD1) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from L. migartoria in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for metabolic activity towards six selected model substrates (luciferin-H, luciferin-Me, luciferin-Be, luciferin-PFBE, luciferin-CEE and 7-ethoxycoumarin), and four selected insecticides (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and methoprene). Recombinant CYP6FD1 showed activity towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and luciferin-Me, but no detectable activity towards the other luciferin derivatives. Furthermore, the enzyme efficiently oxidized deltamethrin to hydroxydeltamethrin through an aromatic hydroxylation in a time-dependent manner. However, the enzyme did not show any detectable activity towards the other three insecticides. Our results provide direct evidence that CYP6FD1 is capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. This work is a step towards a more complete characterization of the catalytic capabilities of CYP6FD1 and other xenobiotic metabolizing CYP enzymes in L. migratoria. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis HS18-1. Bacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium that is a type of insect pathogen used in the field of microbial insect control. B. thuringiensis HS18-1 has effective toxicity for Lepidoptera and Diptera insects. It contains different types of parasporal crystal genes, including cry4Cb1, cry50Aa1, cry69Ab1, cry30Ga, cry30Ea, cry70Aa, cry71Aa, cry72Aa, cry56Aa and cry54Ba. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of B. thuringiensis HS18-1, which contains one circular gapless chromosome and nine circular plasmids.  "
negative,"Transcriptomics and functional genomics of plant defence induction by phloem-feeding insects. The relationship between phloem-feeding insects (PFIs) and plants offers an intriguing example of a highly specialized biotic interaction. These insects have evolved to survive on a nutritionally imbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to minimize wound responses in their host plants. As a consequence, plant perception of and responses to PFIs differ from plant interactions with other insect-feeding guilds. Transcriptome-wide analyses of gene expression are currently being applied to characterize plant responses to PFIs in crop plants with race-specific innate resistance, as well as in compatible interactions with susceptible hosts. Recent studies indicate that PFIs induce transcriptional reprogramming in their host plants, and that plant responses to PFIs appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from responses to other insects or pathogens. Transcript profiling studies also suggest that PFIs induce cell wall modifications, reduce photosynthetic activity, manipulate source-sink relations, and modify secondary metabolism in their hosts, and many of these responses appear to occur within the phloem tissue. Plant responses to these insects appear to be regulated in part by the salicylate, jasmonate, and ethylene signalling pathways. As additional transcript profiling data become available, forward and reverse genetic approaches will be necessary to determine which changes in gene expression influence resistance or susceptibility to PFIs. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). The entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule was 15,314 bp long. The C. raphaelis genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely sequenced mitogenomes of other lepidopteran species, except for the presence of an extra copy of tRNA(Ser)(AGN). High similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between the two tandemly located copies of the tRNA(Ser)(AGN) suggest a recent duplication of an original single tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The DHU arm of the two copies of tRNA(Ser)(AGN) formed a simple loop as seen in many other metazoan mt tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The putative initiation codon for the C. raphaelis COI gene appears to be a tetranucleotide, TTAG, found commonly in the sequenced lepidopterans. ATPase8, ATPase6, ND4L and ND6 genes, which are next to another protein-coding gene at their 3' end all had the sequences potential to form a hairpin structure, suggesting the importance of such a structure for precise cleavage of the mature protein-coding genes. "
positive,"Functional characterization of ultraspiracle in Leptinotarsa decemlineata using RNA interference assay. A heterodimer of ultraspiracle (USP) and ecdysone receptor (EcR) mediates 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling cascade to regulate insect moulting and metamorphosis. However, at least two questions remain to be addressed in terms of the molecular importance of USP in insect species. First, is USP involved in both regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis and mediation of 20E signalling in non-drosophilid insects, as in Drosophila melanogaster? Second, does USP play any role in larval metamorphosis except as the partner of heterodimeric receptor to activate the downstream 20E signalling genes? In this paper, we found that RNA interference (RNAi) of LdUSP in the final (fourth) instar larvae reduced the messenger RNA levels of four ecdysteroidogenesis genes (Ldspo, Ldphm, Lddib and Ldsad) and 20E titre, and repressed the expression of five 20E signal genes (EcRA, HR3, HR4, E74 and E75) in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The LdUSP RNAi larvae remained as prepupae, with developing antennae, legs and discs of forewings and hindwings. Dietary supplement with 20E restored the expression of the five 20E signal genes, but only partially alleviated the decreased pupation rate in LdUSP RNAi beetles. Knockdown of LdUSP at the penultimate (third) instar larvae did not affect third-fourth instar moulting. However, silencing LdUSP caused similar but less severe impairments on pupation. Accordingly, we propose that USP is undoubtedly necessary for ecdysteroidogenesis, for mediation of 20E signalling and for initiation of metamorphosis in L. decemlineata. "
negative,"A genome-scale protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 uncovers additional nodes of the human p53 network. The genome of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a single p53-like protein, phylogenetically related to the ancestor of the mammalian p53 family of tumor suppressors. We reasoned that a comprehensive map of the protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) might help identify conserved interactions of the entire p53 family in man. Using a genome-scale in vitro expression cloning approach, we identified 91 previously unreported Dmp53 interactors, considerably expanding the current Drosophila p53 interactome. Looking for evolutionary conservation of these interactions, we tested 41 mammalian orthologs and found that 37 bound to one or more p53-family members when overexpressed in human cells. An RNAi-based functional assay for modulation of the p53 pathway returned five positive hits, validating the biological relevance of these interactions. One p53 interactor is GTPBP4, a nucleolar protein involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that GTPBP4 knockdown induces p53 accumulation and activation in the absence of nucleolar disruption. In breast tumors with wild-type p53, increased expression of GTPBP4 correlates with reduced patient survival, emphasizing a potential relevance of this regulatory axis in cancer. "
negative,"Evolutionary and functional genetics of insect diapause: a call for greater integration. Diapause in response to seasonality is an important model for rapid evolutionary adaptation that is highly genetically variable, and experiences strong natural selection. Forward genetic methods using various genomic and transcriptomic approaches have begun to characterize the genetic architecture and candidate genes underlying diapause evolution. Largely in parallel, reverse genetic studies have identified functional roles for candidate genes that may or may not be genetically variable. We illustrate the disconnect between the evolutionary and physiological literature using a suite of studies of the role of the circadian clock in diapause regulation. These extensive studies in two different disciplines provide excellent opportunities for integration, which should facilitate rapid progress in understanding both the regulation and evolution of diapause. "
negative,"The evolution of novel host use is unlikely to be constrained by trade-offs or a lack of genetic variation. The genetic and ecological factors that shape the evolution of animal diets remain poorly understood. For herbivorous insects, the expectation has been that trade-offs exist, such that adaptation to one host plant reduces performance on other potential hosts. We investigated the genetic architecture of alternative host use by rearing individual Lycaeides melissa butterflies from two wild populations in a crossed design on two hosts (one native and one introduced) and analysing the genetic basis of differences in performance using genomic approaches. Survival during the experiment was highest when butterfly larvae were reared on their natal host plant, consistent with local adaptation. However, cross-host correlations in performance among families (within populations) were not different from zero. We found that L. melissa populations possess genetic variation for larval performance and variation in performance had a polygenic basis. We documented very few genetic variants with trade-offs that would inherently constrain diet breadth by preventing the optimization of performance across hosts. Instead, most genetic variants that affected performance on one host had little to no effect on the other host. In total, these results suggest that genetic trade-offs are not the primary cause of dietary specialization in L. melissa butterflies.  "
negative,"Studying the organization of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes in Chrysomela tremula provides insights into a leaf beetle genome. The ability of herbivorous beetles from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides has only recently begun to be appreciated. The presence of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in the beetle's digestive tract makes this degradation possible. Sequences encoding these beetle-derived PCWDEs were originally identified from transcriptomes and strikingly resemble those of saprophytic and phytopathogenic microorganisms, raising questions about their origin; e.g. are they insect- or microorganism-derived? To demonstrate unambiguously that the genes encoding PCWDEs found in beetle transcriptomes are indeed of insect origin, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the genome of the leaf beetle Chrysomela tremula, containing 18 432 clones with an average size of 143 kb. After hybridizing this library with probes derived from 12 C. tremula PCWDE-encoding genes and sequencing the positive clones, we demonstrated that the latter genes are encoded by the insect's genome and are surrounded by genes possessing orthologues in the genome of Tribolium castaneum as well as in three other beetle genomes. Our analyses showed that although the level of overall synteny between C. tremula and T. castaneum seems high, the degree of microsynteny between both species is relatively low, in contrast to the more closely related Colorado potato beetle.  "
negative,"An Anopheles stephensi Promoter-Trap: Augmenting Genome Annotation and Functional Genomics. The piggyBac transposon was modified to generate gene trap constructs, which were then incorporated into the genome of the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi and remobilized through genetic crosses using a piggyBac transposase expressing line. A total of 620 remobilization events were documented, and 73 were further characterized at the DNA level to identify patterns in insertion site preferences, remobilization frequencies, and remobilization patterns. Overall, the use of the tetameric AmCyan reporter as the fusion peptide displayed a preference for insertion into the 5'-end of transcripts. Notably 183 - 44882 bp upstream of the An. stephensi v1.0 ab initio gene models, which demonstrated that the promoter regions for the genes of An. stephensi are further upstream of the 5'-proximal regions of the genes in the ab inito models than may be otherwise predicted. RNA-Seq transcript coverage supported the insertion of the splice acceptor gene trap element into 5'-UTR introns for nearly half of all insertions identified. The use of a gene trap element that prefers insertion into the 5'-end of genes supports the use of this technology for the random generation of knock-out mutants, as well as the experimental confirmation of 5'-UTR introns in An. stephensi. "
positive,"Odorant reception in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor (AgOr) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets for controlling the transmission of malaria. "
negative,"Where the baculoviruses lead, the caterpillars follow: baculovirus-induced alterations in caterpillar behaviour. Baculoviruses are well-known for altering the behaviour of their caterpillar hosts by inducing hyperactivity (enhanced locomotion) and / or tree-top disease (climbing to elevated positions before death). These features, along with the genomic small size of baculoviruses compared to non-viral parasites and the at hand techniques for producing mutants, imply that baculoviruses are excellent tools for unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying parasitic alteration of host behaviour. Baculoviruses can be easily mutated, allowing an optimal experimental setup in comparative studies, where for instance host gene expression can be compared between insects infected with wild-type viruses or with mutant viruses lacking genes involved in behavioural manipulation. Recent studies have revealed the first insight into the underlying molecular pathways that lead to the typical behaviour of baculovirus-infected caterpillars and into the role of light therein. Since host behaviour in general is mediated through the host's central nervous system (CNS), a promising future step will be to study how baculoviruses regulate the neuronal activity of the host. "
positive,"Hh signaling from de novo organizers drive lgl neoplasia in Drosophila epithelium. The Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen regulates growth and patterning. Since Hh signaling is also implicated in carcinogenesis, it is conceivable that de novo Hh-secreting organizers, if formed in association with oncogenic hit could be tumor-cooperative. Here we validate this hypothesis using the Drosophila model of cooperative epithelial carcinogenesis. We generate somatic clones with simultaneous loss of tumor suppressor, Lgl, and gain of the posterior compartment selector, Engrailed (En), known to induce synthesis of Hh. We show that lgl UAS-en clones in the anterior wing compartment trigger Hh signaling cascade via cross-talk with their Ci-expressing wild type cell neighbors. Hh-Dpp signaling from clone boundaries of such ectopically formed de novo organizers in turn drive lgl carcinogenesis. By contrast, Ci-expressing lgl clones transform by autocrine and / or juxtracine activation of Hh signaling in only the posterior compartment. We further show that sequestration of the Hh ligand or loss of Dpp receptor, Tkv, in these Hh-sending or -receiving lgl clones arrested their carcinogenesis. Our results therefore reveal a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of tumor cooperation by developmental organizers, which are induced fortuitously by oncogenic hits. "
negative,"Identification of ion channel genes in the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome. Aphids are major pests of crops, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage annually. Ion channel proteins are often the targets of modern insecticides and mutations in ion channel genes can lead to resistance to many leading classes of insecticides. The sequencing of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, genome has now allowed detailed in silico analysis of the aphid ion channels. The study has revealed significant differences in the composition of the ion channel families between the aphid and other insects. For example A. pisum does not appear to contain a homologue of the nACh receptor alpha 5 gene whilst the calcium channel beta subunit has been duplicated. These variations could result in differences in function or sensitivity to insecticides. The genome sequence will allow the study of aphid ion channels to be accelerated, leading to a better understanding of the function of these economically important channels. The potential for identifying novel insecticide targets within the aphid is now a step closer. "
positive,"Comparative analysis of C-type lectin domain proteins in the ghost moth, Thitarodes xiaojinensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae). Insects have a large family of C-type lectins involved in cell adhesion, pathogen recognition and activation of immune responses. In this study, 32 transcripts encoding C-type lectin domain proteins (CTLDPs) were identified from the Thitarodes xiaojinensis transcriptome. According to their domain structures, six CTLDPs with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) were classified into the CTL-S subfamily. The other 23 CTLDPs with two CRDs were grouped into the immulectin (IML) subfamily. The remaining three with extra regulatory domains were sorted into the CTL-X subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CTL-S and CTL-X members from different insects could form orthologous groups. In contrast, no T. xiaojinensis IML orthologues were found in other insects. Remarkable lineage-specific expansion in this subfamily was observed reflecting that these CTLDPs, as important receptors, have evolved diversified members in response to a variety of microbes. Prediction of binding ligands revealed that T. xiaojinensis, a cold-adapted species, conserved the ability of CRDs to combine with Ca2+ to keep its receptors from freezing. Comparative analysis of induction of CTLDP genes after different immune challenges indicated that IMLs might play critical roles in immune defenses. This study examined T. xiaojinensis CTLDPs and provides a basis for further studies of their characteristics. "
negative,"Transcriptomic study of the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus embryogenesis. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an invasive, concealed and destructive tissue borer, and it becomes a lethal pest of the palm family of plants and has been reported to attack 20 palm species around the globe. Here we report a systematic transcriptomic study on embryogenesis of RPW, where we analyze the transcriptomes across five developmental stages of RPW embryogenesis, involving four embryonic stages (E1, E2, E3 and E4) and one larval stage (L1). Using the RNA-seq and next-generation platforms, we generated 80 to 91 million reads for each library and assemble 22 532 genes that are expressed at different embryonic stages. Among the total transcripts from the five embryonic development stages, we found that 30.45 % are differentially expressed, 10.10 % show stage-specificity and even a larger fraction, 62.88 %, exhibit constitutive expression in all the stages. We also analyzes the expression dynamics of several conserved signaling pathways (such as Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, Notch, TGF-β, Ras / MAPK and Wnt), as well as key developmental genes, including those related to apoptosis, axis formation, Hox complex, neurogenesis and segmentation. The datasets provide an essential resource for gene annotation and RPW functional genomics, including studies by using tools and concepts from multiple disciplines, such as development, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics.  "
negative,"A genome-wide survey of small interfering RNA and microRNA pathway genes in a galling insect. Deployment of resistance (R) genes is the most effective control for Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say); however, deployment of R genes results in an increased frequency of pest genotypes that display virulence to them. RNA interference (RNAi) is a useful reverse genetics tool for studying such insect virulence pathways, but requires a systemic phenotype, which is not found in all species. In an effort to correlate our observed weak RNAi phenotype in M. destructor with a genetic basis, we have aggregated and compared RNAi related genes across M. destructor, three other insect species, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here the annotation of the core genes in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways in M. destructor. While most of the miRNA pathway genes were highly conserved across the species studied, the siRNA pathway genes showed increased relative variability in comparison to the miRNA pathway. In particular, the Piwi / Argonaute / Zwille (PAZ) domain of Dicer-2 (DCR-2) had the least amount of sequence similarity of any domain among species surveyed, with a trend of increased conservation in those species with amenable systemic RNAi. A homolog of the systemic interference defective-1 (Sid-1) gene of C. elegans was also not annotated in the M. destructor genome. Indeed, it is of interest that a Sid-1 homolog has not been detected in any dipteran species to date. We hypothesize the sequence architecture of the PAZ domain in the M. destructor DCR-2 protein is related to reduced efficacy of this enzyme and this taken together with the lack of a Sid-1 homolog may account for the weak RNAi response observed to date in this species as well as other dipteran species. "
negative,"BmiGI: a database of cDNAs expressed in Boophilus microplus, the tropical / southern cattle tick. We used an expressed sequence tag approach to initiate a study of the genome of the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. A normalized cDNA library was synthesized from pooled RNA purified from tick larvae which had been subjected to different treatments, including acaricide exposure, heat shock, cold shock, host odor, and infection with Babesia bovis. For the acaricide exposure experiments, we used several strains of ticks, which varied in their levels of susceptibility to pyrethroid, organophosphate and amitraz. We also included RNA purified from samples of eggs, nymphs and adult ticks and dissected tick organs. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 11,520 cDNA clones and both 5' and 3' sequencing performed on each clone. The sequence data was used to search public protein databases and a B. microplus gene index was constructed, consisting of 8270 unique sequences whose associated putative functional assignments, when available, can be viewed at the TIGR website (http: /  / www.tigr.org / tdb / tgi). A number of novel sequences were identified which possessed significant sequence similarity to genes, which might be involved in resistance to acaricides. "
positive,"Egf-like gene is essential for cuticle metabolism in the brown planthopper. Using the mass spectrometry analysis of cuticle casts of brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and transcriptome analysis of BPH tissues, we identified a gigantic gene (50,922 bp, 16,973 aa) tentatively called Nlegf-like. Multiple transcripts were found. Nlegf-like encodes an integral membrane protein of 16,973 amino acid residues with 260 EGF-like repeats and 16 Ca2+-binding EGF repeats type (cbEGFs) in the extracellular portion. Nlegf-like was highly expressed in the integument and tended to peak at the middle stage or late stage of each nymph instar. Phylogenetic analysis showed this gene is conserved in many other insects. Different double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting eight different regions of the Nlegf-like gene resulted in abnormal cuticle formation or molting and lethal phenotypes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the newly formed endocuticle was significantly thinner for RNAi-treated BPHs with phenotype of contracted abdomen, or the old cuticle could not be digested sufficiently for those with phenotype of slender body shape or died with molting difficulty when compared with the control group. We suggest that the Nlegf-like is crucial for metabolism of the cuticle in BPH molting. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was determined as a circular molecular of 15,273 bp in size. The mitogenome composition (37 genes) and gene order are the same as the other lepidopterans. Nucleotide composition of the C. cephalonica mitogenome is highly A+T biased (80.43%) like other insects. Twelve protein-coding genes start with a typical ATN codon, with the exception of coxl gene, which uses CGA as the initial codon. Nine protein-coding genes have the common stop codon TAA, and the nad2, cox1, cox2, and nad4 have single T as the incomplete stop codon. 22 tRNA genes demonstrated cloverleaf secondary structure. The mitogenome has several large intergenic spacer regions, the spacer1 between trnQ gene and nad2 gene, which is common in Lepidoptera. The spacer 3 between trnE and trnF includes microsatellite-like repeat regions (AT)18 and (TTAT)(3). The spacer 4 (16 bp) between trnS2 gene and nad1 gene has a motif ATACTAT; another species, Sesamia inferens encodes ATCATAT at the same position, while other lepidopteran insects encode a similar ATACTAA motif. The spacer 6 is A+T rich region, include motif ATAGA and a 20-bp poly(T) stretch and two microsatellite (AT)(9), (AT)(8) elements. "
negative,"Genomic analysis of ""Elusimicrobium minutum,"" the first cultivated representative of the phylum ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly termite group 1). Organisms of the candidate phylum termite group 1 (TG1) are regularly encountered in termite hindguts but are present also in many other habitats. Here, we report the complete genome sequence (1.64 Mbp) of ""Elusimicrobium minutum"" strain Pei191(T), the first cultured representative of the TG1 phylum. We reconstructed the metabolism of this strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from a beetle larva gut, and we discuss the findings in light of physiological data. E. minutum has all genes required for uptake and fermentation of sugars via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, including several hydrogenases, and an unusual peptide degradation pathway comprising transamination reactions and leading to the formation of alanine, which is excreted in substantial amounts. The presence of genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the presence of a pathway for peptidoglycan formation are consistent with ultrastructural evidence of a gram-negative cell envelope. Even though electron micrographs showed no cell appendages, the genome encodes many genes putatively involved in pilus assembly. We assigned some to a type II secretion system, but the function of 60 pilE-like genes remains unknown. Numerous genes with hypothetical functions, e.g., polyketide synthesis, nonribosomal peptide synthesis, antibiotic transport, and oxygen stress protection, indicate the presence of hitherto undiscovered physiological traits. Comparative analysis of 22 concatenated single-copy marker genes corroborated the status of ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly TG1) as a separate phylum in the bacterial domain, which was so far based only on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. "
negative,"Functional consequences of mutations in the Drosophila histamine receptor HCLB. The gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in hclB lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of hclB in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two D. melanogaster mutants, hclB(T1) (P293S) and hclB(T2) (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41 degrees C, the hclB(T2) flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the hclB(T1) flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in hclB(T1) after anaesthesia with halothane. Enhanced synaptic signalling at low-intensity light stimuli was registered on electroretinograms recorded from the two mutant strains. Our results suggest that HCLB may play an essential and conserved role in insect neurophysiology. "
negative,"Applications of genome editing in insects. Insect genome editing was first reported 1991 in Drosophila melanogaster but the technology used was not portable to other species. Not until the recent development of facile, engineered DNA endonuclease systems has gene editing become widely available to insect scientists. Most applications in insects to date have been technical in nature but this is rapidly changing. Functional genomics and genetics-based insect control efforts will be major beneficiaries of the application of contemporary gene editing technologies. Engineered endonucleases like Cas9 make it possible to create powerful and effective gene drive systems that could be used to reduce or even eradicate specific insect populations. 'Best practices' for using Cas9-based editing are beginning to emerge making it easier and more effective to design and use but gene editing technologies still require traditional means of delivery in order to introduce them into somatic and germ cells of insects-microinjection of developing embryos. This constrains the use of these technologies by insect scientists. Insects created using editing technologies challenge existing governmental regulatory structures designed to manage genetically modified organisms. "
negative,"Comparative analysis of serine protease-related genes in the honey bee genome: possible involvement in embryonic development and innate immunity. We have identified 44 serine protease (SP) and 13 serine protease homolog (SPH) genes in the genome of Apis mellifera. Most of these genes encode putative secreted proteins, but four SPs and three SPHs may associate with the plasma membrane via a transmembrane region. Clip domains represent the most abundant non-catalytic structural units in these SP-like proteins -12 SPs and six SPHs contain at least one clip domain. Some of the family members contain other modules for protein-protein interactions, including disulphide-stabilized structures (LDL(r)A, SRCR, frizzled, kringle, Sushi, Wonton and Pan / apple), carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type lectin and chitin-binding), and other modules (such as zinc finger, CUB, coiled coil and Sina). Comparison of the sequences with those from Drosophila led to a proposed SP pathway for establishing the dorsoventral axis of honey bee embryos. Multiple sequence alignments revealed evolutionary relationships of honey bee SPs and SPHs with those in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Manduca sexta. We identified homologs of D. melanogaster persephone, M. sexta HP14, PAP-1 and SPH-1. A. mellifera genome includes at least five genes for potential SP inhibitors (serpin-1 through -5) and three genes of SP putative substrates (prophenoloxidase, spätzle-1 and spätzle-2). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed an elevation in the mRNA levels of SP2, SP3, SP9, SP10, SPH41, SPH42, SP49, serpin-2, serpin-4, serpin-5, and spätzle-2 in adults after a microbial challenge. The SP41 and SP6 transcripts significantly increased after an injection of Paenibacillus larva, but there was no such increase after injection of saline or Escherichia coli. mRNA levels of most SPs and serpins significantly increased by 48 h after the pathogen infection in 1st instar larvae. On the contrary, SP1, SP3, SP19 and serpin-5 transcript levels reduced. These results, taken together, provide a framework for designing experimental studies of the roles of SPs and related proteins in embryonic development and immune responses of A. mellifera. "
negative,"Whole transcriptome responses among females of the filariasis and arbovirus vector mosquito Culex pipiens implicate TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification as key drivers of diapause induction. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are important disease vectors inhabiting temperate zones, worldwide. The seasonal reduction in temperature and photoperiod accompanying late summer and early fall prompts female mosquitoes to enter diapause, a stage of developmental arrest and physiological conditioning that enhances survival during the winter months. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying diapause induction, we used custom whole transcriptome microarrays to identify differences in gene expression following exposure to nondiapause (long days, 25 °C) and diapause-inducing (short days, 18 °C) environmental conditions. Using a two-way ANOVA, we identified 1130 genes that were differentially expressed. We used the expression of these genes across three time points to construct a gene co-expression network comprising five modules. Genes in modules 1, 2, and 3 were largely up-regulated, while genes in modules 4 and 5 were down-regulated when compared to nondiapause conditions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the network modules revealed some potential regulatory mechanisms driving diapause induction. Module 1 was enriched for genes in the TGF-ß and Wnt signaling pathways; module 2 was enriched for genes involved in insect hormone biosynthesis, specifically, ecdysone synthesis; module 3 was enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification; and module 5 was enriched for genes in the circadian rhythm pathway. Our results suggest that TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification are key drivers for the integration of environmental signals into the diapause induction phase in C. pipiens mosquitoes. "
negative,"Complete DNA sequence of Kuraishia capsulata illustrates novel genomic features among budding yeasts (Saccharomycotina). The numerous yeast genome sequences presently available provide a rich source of information for functional as well as evolutionary genomics but unequally cover the large phylogenetic diversity of extant yeasts. We present here the complete sequence of the nuclear genome of the haploid-type strain of Kuraishia capsulata (CBS1993(T)), a nitrate-assimilating Saccharomycetales of uncertain taxonomy, isolated from tunnels of insect larvae underneath coniferous barks and characterized by its copious production of extracellular polysaccharides. The sequence is composed of seven scaffolds, one per chromosome, totaling 11.4 Mb and containing 6,029 protein-coding genes, ~13.5% of which being interrupted by introns. This GC-rich yeast genome (45.7%) appears phylogenetically related with the few other nitrate-assimilating yeasts sequenced so far, Ogataea polymorpha, O. parapolymorpha, and Dekkera bruxellensis, with which it shares a very reduced number of tRNA genes, a novel tRNA sparing strategy, and a common nitrate assimilation cluster, three specific features to this group of yeasts. Centromeres were recognized in GC-poor troughs of each scaffold. The strain bears MAT alpha genes at a single MAT locus and presents a significant degree of conservation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, suggesting that it can perform sexual cycles in nature, although genes involved in meiosis were not all recognized. The complete absence of conservation of synteny between K. capsulata and any other yeast genome described so far, including the three other nitrate-assimilating species, validates the interest of this species for long-range evolutionary genomic studies among Saccharomycotina yeasts. "
negative,"Gene expression changes governing extreme dehydration tolerance in an Antarctic insect. Among terrestrial organisms, arthropods are especially susceptible to dehydration, given their small body size and high surface area to volume ratio. This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable for much of the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to quantify transcriptional mechanisms of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world's southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70% of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and ATP production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct transcriptional mechanisms to cope with similar desiccating conditions. "
positive,"Structure and evolution of the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE) gene from the firefly Photinus pyralis. To study the structural features of genes for the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE), the entire gene along with 524 bp of upstream sequence was determined from Photinus pyralis (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). The LRE gene revealed an open reading frame composed of five exons divided by four introns ranging in size from 47 to 904 bp. The deduced LRE amino acid sequence showed identity to senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) from a number of insects and mammals including four putative SMP30 sequences from Anopheles gambiae. Gene structure comparisons showed some intron / exon site conservation with A. gambiae and mammalian SMP30 proteins but not Drosophila. LRE and luciferase sequence comparisons revealed two conserved putative luciferin-binding sites. The evolution of LRE was discussed in relation to its function. "
positive,"Translational and transcriptional control elements in the untranslated leader of the heat-shock gene hsp22. Downstream of the transcription start site in the Drosophila heat-shock gene hsp22, we have identified a region that is necessary for efficient transcription, and also for selective translation during heat shock. We assayed the expression of mutated genes after P-factor-mediated insertion into the genome. Deletions within the first 26 nucleotides block the preferential translation of hsp22 mRNA at high temperature. The rate of transcription is also decreased, though transcription is still heat-inducible. Leaving this region intact, up to 86% of the leader can be deleted without affecting translation or transcription. The functional region coincides with a region of sequence homology between the heat-shock genes. Only partial homology is found to a conserved sequence, ATCAGTTCT, found at the very 5' end of other insect genes. "
positive,"Hunchback knockdown induces supernumerary segment formation in Bombyx. Insect segment number within species appears to be fixed irrespective of germ types: long vs. short / intermediate. The present study showed induction of supernumerary segment formation by the knockdown of Bombyx hunchback (Bm-hb), presumably by terminal segment addition, a short / intermediate-like-segmentation mode that is not observed in normal Bombyx embryogenesis. This suggests that Bm-hb suppresses segmentation. The results obtained also suggest that the gap gene Bm-Kr (Bombyx Krüppel) provides a permissive environment for the progression of segmentation by suppressing the expression Bm-hb, which terminates segmentation. This indicates a novel mechanism by which the gap gene is involved in segmentation. It appears that Bm-Kr and Bm-hb are involved in segment counting and their interplay contributes to the correct number of segments being formed in Bombyx. Similar mechanisms may be operating in insects that employ the non-Drosophilan mode of segmentation such as in short / intermediate-germ insects. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73. Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive bacterium that produces intracellular protein crystals toxic to a wide variety of insect larvae. We report the complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73 from the Centre OILB (Institut Pasteur, France), which belongs to serotype 3ab and is toxic to lepidopteran larvae. "
negative,"Reovirus genomes from plant-feeding insects represent a newly discovered lineage within the family Reoviridae. A complex set of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) was isolated from threecornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus), a plant-feeding hemipteran pest. A subset of these dsRNAs constitute the genome of a new reovirus, provisionally designated Spissistilus festinus reovirus (SpFRV). SpFRV was present in threecornered alfalfa hopper populations in the San Joaquin Valley of California, with incidence ranging from 10% to 60% in 24 of 25 sample sets analyzed. The 10 dsRNA segments of SpFRV were completely sequenced and shown to share conserved terminal sequences (5'-AGAGA and CGAUGUUGU-3') of the positive-sense strand that are distinct from known species of the family Reoviridae. Comparisons of the RNA directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) indicated SpFRV is most closely related (39.1% amino acid identity) to another new reovirus infecting the angulate leafhopper (Acinopterus angulatus) and provisionally designated Acinopterus angulatus reovirus (AcARV). The RdRp of both viruses was distantly related to Raspberry latent virus RdRp at 27.0% (SpFRV) and 30.0% (AcARV) or Rice ragged stunt virus RdRp at 26.2% (SpFRV) and 29.0% (AcARV) amino acid identity. RdRp phylogeny confirmed that SpFRV and AcARV are sister taxa sharing a most recent common ancestor. SpFRV segment 6 encodes a protein containing two NTP binding motifs that are conserved in homologs of reoviruses in the subfamily Spinareovirinae. The protein encoded by SpFRV segment 4 was identified as a guanylyltransferase homolog. SpFRV segments 1, 3, and 10 encode homologs of reovirus structural proteins. No homologs were identified for proteins encoded by SpFRV segments 5, 7, 8, and 9. Collectively, the low level of sequence identity with other reoviruses, similar segment terminal sequences, RdRp phylogeny, and host taxa indicate that SpFRV and AcARV may be considered members of a proposed new genus of the family Reoviridae (subfamily Spinareovirinae), with SpFRV assigned as the type species.

positive,"Molecular characterization of glutamate-gated chloride channel and its possible roles in development and abamectin susceptibility in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in invertebrate nervous systems, and are of considerable interest in insecticide discovery. The full length cDNA encoding CsGluCl was cloned from the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker). Multiple cDNA sequence alignment revealed three variants of CsGluCl generated by alternative splicing of exon 3 and exon 9. While all the transcripts were predominantly expressed in both nerve cord and brain, the expression patterns of these three variants differed among other tissues and developmental stages. Specifically, the expression level of CsGluCl C in cuticle was similar to that in nerve cord and brain, and was the predominant variant in late pupae and early adult stages. Both injection and oral delivery of dsGluCl significantly reduced the mRNA level of CsGluCl. Increased susceptibility to abamectin and reduced larvae growth and pupation rate were observed in dsGluCl-treated larvae. Thus, our results provide the evidence that in addition to act as the target of abamectin, GluCls also play important physiological roles in the development of insects. "
negative,"Functional Immunomics of the Squash Bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer) (Heteroptera: Coreidae). The Squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a major piercing / sucking pest of cucurbits, causing extensive damage to plants and fruits, and transmitting phytopathogens. No genomic resources to facilitate field and laboratory studies of this pest were available; therefore the first de novo exome for this destructive pest was assembled. RNA was extracted from insects challenged with bacterial and fungal immunoelicitors, insects fed on different cucurbit species, and insects from all life stages from egg to adult. All treatments and replicates were separately barcoded for subsequent analyses, then pooled for sequencing in a single lane using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Over 211 million 100-base tags generated in this manner were trimmed, filtered, and cleaned, then assembled into a de novo reference transcriptome using the Broad Institute Trinity assembly algorithm. The assembly was annotated using NCBIx NR, BLAST2GO, KEGG and other databases. Of the >130,000 total assemblies 37,327 were annotated identifying the sequences of candidate gene silencing targets from immune, endocrine, reproductive, cuticle, and other physiological systems. Expression profiling of the adult immune response was accomplished by aligning the 100-base tags from each biological replicate from each treatment and controls to the annotated reference assembly of the A. tristis transcriptome.

negative,"Genome sequence of Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420T, a symbiotic bacterium from entomopathogenic nematode. Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) (=CGMCC 1.6853(T), DZ0503SBS1(T)), isolated from the intestine of Heterorhabditidoides chongmingensis, has been known to have symbiotic-pathogenic life cycle, on the multilateral relationships with entomopathogenic nematode and insect pest. In order to better understanding of this rare feature in Serratia species, we present here the genome sequence of S. nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) with the significance of first genome sequence in this species.  "
negative,"Large diversity of the piggyBac-like elements in the genome of Tribolium castaneum. The piggyBac transposable element (TE), originally discovered in the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, has been widely used in insect transgenesis including the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We surveyed piggyBac-like (PLE) sequences in the genome of T. castaneum by homology searches using as queries the diverse PLE sequences that have been described previously. The search yielded a total of 32 piggyBac-like elements (TcPLEs) which were classified into 14 distinct groups. Most of the TcPLEs contain defective functional motifs in that they are lacking inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) or have disrupted open reading frames. Only one single copy of TcPLE1 appears to be intact with imperfect 16bp ITRs flanking an open reading frame encoding a transposase of 571 amino acid residues. Many copies of TcPLEs were found to be inserted into or close to other transposon-like sequences. This large diversity of TcPLEs with generally low copy numbers suggests multiple invasions of the TcPLEs over a long evolutionary time without extensive multiplications or occurrence of rapid loss of TcPLEs copies. "
positive,"RNAi of ace1 and ace2 in Blattella germanica reveals their differential contribution to acetylcholinesterase activity and sensitivity to insecticides. Cyclorrhapha insect genomes contain a single acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene while other insects contain at least two ace genes (ace1 and ace2). In this study we tested the hypothesis that the two ace paralogous from Blattella germanica have different contributions to AChE activity, using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown each one individually. Paralogous-specific depletion of Bgace transcripts was evident in ganglia of injected cockroaches, although the effects at the protein level were less pronounced. Using spectrophotometric and zymogram measurements, we obtained evidence that BgAChE1 represents 65-75% of the total AChE activity in nerve tissue demonstrating that ace1 encodes a predominant AChE. A significant increase in sensitivity of Bgace1-interfered cockroaches was observed after 48 h of exposure to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, Bgace2 knockdown had a negligible effect on mortality to this organophosphate. These results point out a key role, qualitative and / or quantitative, of AChE1 as target of organophosphate insecticides in this species. Silencing the expression of Bgace1 but not Bgace2 also produced an increased mortality in insects when synergized with lambda-cyhalothrin, a situation which resembles the synergistic effects observed between organophosphates and pyrethroids. Gene silencing of ace genes by RNAi offers an exciting approach for examining a possible functional differentiation in ace paralogous. "
negative,The promise of insect genomics. Insects are the largest animal group in the world and are ecologically and economically extremely important. This importance of insects is reflected by the existence of currently 24 insect genome projects. Our perspective discusses the state-of-the-art of these genome projects and the impacts that they have on basic insect science and pest control. 
negative,"Delivery of dsRNA for RNAi in insects: an overview and future directions. RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the process of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing the complementary endogenous messenger RNA. RNAi has been widely used in entomological research for functional genomics in a variety of insects and its potential for RNAi-based pest control has been increasingly emphasized mainly because of its high specificity. This review focuses on the approaches of introducing dsRNA into insect cells or insect bodies to induce effective RNAi. The three most common delivery methods, namely, microinjection, ingestion, and soaking, are illustrated in details and their advantages and limitations are summarized for purpose of feasible RNAi research. In this review, we also briefly introduce the two possible dsRNA uptake machineries, other dsRNA delivery methods and the history of RNAi in entomology. Factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of RNAi such as transfection reagents, selection of dsRNA region, length, and stability of dsRNA in RNAi research are discussed for further studies. "
negative,"Genome-wide association study of insect bite hypersensitivity in two horse populations in the Netherlands. BACKGROUND: Insect bite hypersensitivity is a common allergic disease in horse populations worldwide. Insect bite hypersensitivity is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. However, little is known about genes contributing to the genetic variance associated with insect bite hypersensitivity. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify and quantify genomic associations with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses in the Netherlands. METHODS: Data on 200 Shetland pony mares and 146 Icelandic horses were collected according to a matched case-control design. Cases and controls were matched on various factors (e.g. region, sire) to minimize effects of population stratification. Breed-specific genome-wide association studies were performed using 70 k single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes. Bayesian variable selection method Bayes-C with a threshold model implemented in GenSel software was applied. A 1 Mb non-overlapping window approach that accumulated contributions of adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to identify associated genomic regions. RESULTS: The percentage of variance explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms was 13% in Shetland pony mares and 28% in Icelandic horses. The 20 non-overlapping windows explaining the largest percentages of genetic variance were found on nine chromosomes in Shetland pony mares and on 14 chromosomes in Icelandic horses. Overlap in identified associated genomic regions between breeds would suggest interesting candidate regions to follow-up on. Such regions common to both breeds (within 15 Mb) were found on chromosomes 3, 7, 11, 20 and 23. Positional candidate genes within 2 Mb from the associated windows were identified on chromosome 20 in both breeds. Candidate genes are within the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region, which evokes an immune response by recognizing many foreign molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The genome-wide association study identified several genomic regions associated with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses. On chromosome 20, associated genomic regions in both breeds were within 2 Mb from the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region. Increased knowledge on insect bite hypersensitivity associated genes will contribute to our understanding of its biology, enabling more efficient selection, therapy and prevention to decrease insect bite hypersensitivity prevalence. "
negative,"Knockdown of midgut genes by dsRNA-transgenic plant-mediated RNA interference in the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technique for functional genomics research in insects. Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been reported for lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, showing potential for field-level control of insect pests, but this has not been reported for other insect orders. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Hemipteran insect brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a typical phloem sap feeder specific to rice (Oryza sativa L.). To analyze the potential of exploiting RNAi-mediated effects in this insect, we identified genes (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) encoding proteins that might be involved in the RNAi pathway in N. lugens. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously in nymphs and adult insects. Three genes (the hexose transporter gene NlHT1, the carboxypeptidase gene Nlcar and the trypsin-like serine protease gene Nltry) that are highly expressed in the N. lugens midgut were isolated and used to develop dsRNA constructs for transforming rice. RNA blot analysis showed that the dsRNAs were transcribed and some of them were processed to siRNAs in the transgenic lines. When nymphs were fed on rice plants expressing dsRNA, levels of transcripts of the targeted genes in the midgut were reduced; however, lethal phenotypic effects after dsRNA feeding were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that genes for the RNAi pathway (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) are present in N. lugens. When insects were fed on rice plant materials expressing dsRNAs, RNA interference was triggered and the target genes transcript levels were suppressed. The gene knockdown technique described here may prove to be a valuable tool for further investigations in N. lugens. The results demonstrate the potential of dsRNA-mediated RNAi for field-level control of planthoppers, but appropriate target genes must be selected when designing the dsRNA-transgenic plants. "
negative,"Metabolic pools differ among ecologically diverse Drosophila species. Studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying metabolic storage have focused on a few model organisms. Although very fruitful, these studies have not allowed for the examination of mechanisms across a phylogenetic spectrum. The exploration of natural patterns of metabolic pool size variation across species will help us to better understand the genetics of metabolic adaptation. We examined the metabolic pools size (triglyceride, glycogen and protein) at two ages in 12 Drosophila species with distinctly different ecologies for which complete genome sequences (for 11 of the 12 species) are known. Overall, there were significant differences across species for all three pools, while age and sex appear to affect some metabolic pools more than others. After correcting for the phylogenetic relatedness of the species used, we observed no association between triglyceride and glycogen content. Although within species these two pools sometimes are correlated, at a larger phylogenetic scale control of triglyceride and glycogen contents may have been shaped independently by natural selection. "
negative,"RNA interference in the termite Reticulitermes flavipes through ingestion of double-stranded RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) represents a breakthrough technology for conducting functional genomics research in non-model organisms and for the highly targeted control of insect pests. This study investigated RNAi via voluntary feeding in the economically important pest termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We used a high-dose double-stranded (ds) RNA feeding approach to silence two termite genes: one encoding an endogenous digestive cellulase enzyme and the other a caste-regulatory hexamerin storage protein. Contrary to results from previous low-dose studies that examined injection-based RNAi, high-dose silencing of either gene through dsRNA feeding led to significantly reduced group fitness and mortality. Hexamerin silencing in combination with ectopic juvenile hormone treatments additionally led to lethal molting impacts and increased differentiation of presoldier caste phenotypes (a phenotype that is not capable of feeding). These results provide the first examples of insecticidal effects from dsRNA feeding in a termite. Additionally, these results validate a high-throughput bioassay approach for use in (i) termite functional genomics research, and (ii) characterizing target sites of conventional and novel RNAi-based termiticides. "
negative,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and comparative analysis with five additional insects. Glutathione S-transferases are important detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide resistance. Sequencing the Tribolium castaneum genome provides an opportunity to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of GSTs on a genome-wide scale. Thirty-six putative cytosolic GSTs and 5 microsomal GSTs have been identified in T. castaneum. Furthermore, 40, 35, 13, 23, and 32 GSTs have been discovered the other insects, Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Acyrthosiphon, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that insect-specific GSTs, Epsilon and Delta, are the largest species-specific expanded GSTs. In T. castaneum, most GSTs are tandemly arranged in three chromosomes. Particularly, Epsilon GSTs have an inverted long-fragment duplication in the genome. Other four widely distributed classes are highly conserved in all species. Given that GSTs specially expanded in Tribolium castaneum, these genes might help to resist poisonous chemical environments and produce resistance to kinds of different insecticides. "
positive,"Cloning of a putative Bombyx mori TFIIB-related factor (BRF). To identify the protein domains responsible for its conserved and specialized functions, putative TFIIB-Related Factor (BRF) from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) was compared with BRFs from other organisms. The Bombyx BRF coding region was assembled from three separate and overlapping cDNA fragments. Fragments encoding the middle portion and the 3' end were discovered in the Bombyx mori Genome Project ""Silkbase"" collection through sequence homology with human BRF1, and the fragment encoding the N-terminus was isolated in our laboratory using the 5' RACE method. Southern analysis showed that silkworm BRF is encoded by a single-copy gene. Bombyx BRF contains the following domains that have been noted in all other BRFs, and that are likely, therefore, to provide highly conserved functions: a zinc finger domain, an imperfect repeat, three ""BRF Homology"" domains, and an acidic domain at the C-terminus. As expected from the evolutionary relationships among insects and mammals, Bombyx BRF is more similar overall to Drosophila BRF (55% identical) than to human BRF1 (42% identical). Detailed examination of individual domains reveals a remarkable exception, however. Domain II of Bombyx BRF is more similar to its human counterpart than to Drosophila Domain II. This result indicates that Domain II has undergone unusual divergence in Drosophila, and suggests a structural basis for Drosophila BRF's unique pattern of interaction with other transcription factors. "
positive,"Domain structure and expression along the midgut and carcass of peritrophins and cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins in insects with and without peritrophic membrane. Most insects have a peritrophic membrane (matrix) (PM) surrounding the food bolus. This structure, similarly to the cuticle, is mainly composed of chitin and proteins. The main proteins forming PM are known as peritrophins (PMP), whereas some of the cuticle proteins are the cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins (CPAP). Both proteins are composed of one or more chitin binding peritrophin-A domain (CBD) and no other recognized domain. Furthermore, insects containing PM usually have two chitin synthase (CS) genes, one mainly expressed in carcass and the other in midgut. In this work we identified PMP, CPAP and CS genes in the genome of insects from the Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera and Holometabola cohorts and analyzed their expression profile in different species from each group. In agreement with the absence of PM, we observed less CBD-containing proteins and only one CS gene in the genome of Paraneoptera species, except for the Phthiraptera Pediculus humanus. The lack of PM in Paraneoptera species was also confirmed by the micrographs of the midgut of two Hemiptera species, Dysdercus peruvianus and Mahanarva fimbriolata which agreed with the RNA-seq data of both species. Our analyses also highlighted a higher number of CBD-containing proteins in Holometabola in relation to the earlier divergent Polyneoptera group, especially regarding the genes composed of more than three CBDs, which are usually associated to PM formation. Finally, we observed a high number of CBD-containing proteins being expressed in both midgut and carcass tissues of several species, which we named as ubiquitous-CBD-containing proteins (UCBP), as their function is unclear. We hypothesized that these proteins can be involved in both cuticle and PM formation or that they can be involved in immune response and / or tracheolae formation. "
positive,"Multiple functions of CREB-binding protein during postembryonic development: identification of target genes. BACKGROUND: Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect. RESULTS: CBP is ubiquitously expressed in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of CBP resulted in a decrease in JH induction of Kr-h1 gene expression in Tribolium larvae and led to a block in their development. Moreover, the injection of CBP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed lethal phenotypes within 8 days of injection. RNA-seq and subsequent differential gene expression analysis identified CBP target genes in Tribolium. Knockdown of CBP caused a decrease in the expression of 1306 genes coding for transcription factors and other proteins associated with growth and development. Depletion of CBP impaired the expression of several JH response genes (e.g., Kr-h1, Hairy, early trypsin) and ecdysone response genes (EcR, E74, E75, and broad complex). Further, GO enrichment analyses of the downregulated genes showed enrichment in different functions including developmental processes, pigmentation, anatomical structure development, regulation of biological and cellular processes, etc. CONCLUSION: These data suggest diverse but crucial roles for CBP during postembryonic development in the coleopteran model insect, Tribolium. It can serve as a target for RNAi mediated pest management of this stored product pest. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of phenobarbital-inducible genes in Drosophila melanogaster. An oligoarray analysis was conducted to determine the differential expression of genes due to phenobarbital exposure in Drosophila melanogaster (w(1118) strain) third instar larvae. Seventeen genes were observed to be induced with increased expression by a statistical analysis of microarrays approach with a q < or = 0.05. At q < or = 0.12, four more genes (Cyp12d1, DmGstd4, and two genes with unknown function) were found to be up-regulated, and 11 genes with unknown function were found to be down-regulated. Fifteen of these genes, Cyp4d14, Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp12d1, Cyp6d5, Cyp6w1, CG2065, DmGstd6, DmGstd7, Amy-p / Amy-d, Ugt86Dd, GC5724, Jheh1, Jheh2 and CG11893, were verified using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Some of these genes have been shown to be over-transcribed in metabolically DDT-resistant Drosophila strains. "
negative,"Phylogeny and evolution of the cholesterol transporter NPC1 in insects. Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b. "
negative,"Extensive genetic diversity among populations of the malaria mosquito Anopheles moucheti revealed by population genomics. Malaria vectors are exposed to intense selective pressures due to large-scale intervention programs that are underway in most African countries. One of the current priorities is therefore to clearly assess the adaptive potential of Anopheline populations, which is critical to understand and anticipate the response mosquitoes can elicit against such adaptive challenges. The development of genomic resources that will empower robust examinations of evolutionary changes in all vectors including currently understudied species is an inevitable step toward this goal. Here we constructed double-digest Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries and generated 6461 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that we used to explore the population structure and demographic history of wild-caught Anopheles moucheti from Cameroon. The genome-wide distribution of allelic frequencies among samples best fitted that of an old population at equilibrium, characterized by a weak genetic structure and extensive genetic diversity, presumably due to a large long term effective population size. Estimates of FST and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs reveal a very low genetic differentiation throughout the genome and the absence of segregating LD blocks among populations, suggesting an overall lack of local adaptation. Our study provides the first investigation of the genetic structure and diversity in An. moucheti at the genomic scale. We conclude that, despite a weak genetic structure, this species has the potential to challenge current vector control measures and other rapid anthropogenic and environmental changes thanks to its great genetic diversity. "
negative,"Discovery, adaptation and transcriptional activity of two tick promoters: Construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for optimization of RNA interference in rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus cell lines. Dual luciferase reporter systems are valuable tools for functional genomic studies, but have not previously been developed for use in tick cell culture. We evaluated expression of available luciferase constructs in tick cell cultures derived from Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, an important vector of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Commercial promoters were evaluated for transcriptional activity driving luciferase expression in the tick cell lines. The human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter resulted in detectable firefly luciferase activity within 2 days post-transfection of the R. microplus cell line BME26, with maximal activity at 5 days post-transfection. Several other promoters were weaker or inactive in the tick cells, prompting identification and assessment of transcriptional activity of the homologous ribosomal protein L4 (rpL4, GenBank accession no.: KM516205) and elongation factor 1α (EF-1α, GenBank accession no.: KM516204) promoters cloned from R. microplus. Evaluation of luciferase expression driven by various promoters in tick cell culture resulted in selection of the R. microplus rpL4 promoter and the human PGK promoter driving transcription of sequences encoding modified firefly and NanoLuc® luciferases for construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for use in tick cell culture.  "
negative,"Engineering the genomes of wild insect populations: challenges, and opportunities provided by synthetic Medea selfish genetic elements. Advances in insect transgenesis and our knowledge of insect physiology and genomics are making it possible to create transgenic populations of beneficial or pest insects that express novel traits. There are contexts in which we may want the transgenes responsible for these traits to spread so that all individuals within a wild population carry them, a process known as population replacement. Transgenes of interest are unlikely to confer an overall fitness benefit on those who carry them. Therefore, an essential component of any population replacement strategy is the presence of a drive mechanism that will ensure the spread of linked transgenes. We discuss contexts in which population replacement might be desirable and the requirements a drive system must satisfy to be both effective and safe. We then describe the creation of synthetic Medea elements, the first selfish genetic elements synthesized de novo, with the capability of driving population replacement, in this case in Drosophila. The strategy used to create Drosophila Medea is applicable to a number of other insect species and the Medea system satisfies key requirements for scientific and social acceptance. Finally, we highlight several challenges to implementing population replacement in the wild. "
positive,"The limpet transcription factors of Triatoma infestans regulate the response to fungal infection and modulate the expression pattern of defensin genes. As part of the innate humoral response to microbial attack, insects activate the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this response in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans is important since biological control strategies against pyrethroid-resistant insect populations were recently addressed by using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. By bioinformatics, gene expression, and silencing techniques in T. infestans nymphs, we achieved sequence and functional characterization of two variants of the limpet transcription factor (Tilimpet) and studied their role as regulators of the AMP expression, particularly defensins, in fungus-infected insects. We found that Tilimpet variants may act differentially since they have divergent sequences and different relative expression ratios, suggesting that Tilimpet-2 could be the main regulator of the higher expressed defensins and Tilimpet-1 might play a complementary or more general role. Also, the six defensins (Tidef-1 to Tidef-6) exhibited different expression levels in fungus-infected nymphs, consistent with their phylogenetic clustering. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of T. infestans immune response in which limpet is involved, after challenge by B. bassiana infection. "
negative,"Genetic regions that interact with loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes of deltex implicate novel genes in Drosophila Notch signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates many cell fate decisions. The deltex (dx) gene encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that binds to the intracellular domain of the Notch protein and regulates Notch signaling in a positive manner. However, it is still not clear how Dx does this. We generated a transgenic line, GMR-dx, which overexpresses dx in the developing Drosophila eye disc. The GMR-dx line showed a rough-eye phenotype, specific transformation of a photoreceptor cell (R3 to R4), and a rotation defect in the ommatidia. This phenotype was suppressed in combination with a dx loss-of-function mutant, indicating that it was due to a dx gain-of-function. We previously reported that overexpression of Dx results in the stabilization of Notch in late endosomes. Here, we found that three motifs in Dx, a region that binds to Notch, a proline-rich motif and a RING-H2 finger, were required for this stabilization, although the relative activity of these variants in this assay did not always correspond to the severity of the rough-eye phenotype. In an attempt to identify novel genes of the Notch pathway, we tested a large collection of chromosomal deficiencies for the ability to modify the eye phenotypes of the GMR-dx line. Twelve genomic segments that enhanced the rough-eye phenotype of GMR-dx were identified. To evaluate the specificity of these interactions, we then determined whether the deletions also interacted with the wing phenotypes associated with a loss-of-function mutation of dx, dx24. Analyses based on whole-genome information allowed us to conclude that we have identified two novel loci that probably include uncharacterized genes involved in Dx-mediated Notch signaling. "
positive,"Genome-wide gene expression profiling reveals that cuticle alterations and P450 detoxification are associated with deltamethrin and DDT resistance in Anopheles arabiensis populations from Ethiopia. BACKGROUND: Vector control is the main intervention in malaria control and elimination strategies. However, the development of insecticide resistance is one of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although an L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations - Asendabo, Chewaka and Tolay - and two susceptible strains - Sekoru and Mozambique. RESULTS: Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4, were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance. Although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle, a higher cuticular hydrocarbon content was observed in a resistant population. CONCLUSION: Our transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance mechanisms and paves the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle composition in insecticide resistance of malaria vectors. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Dysfunction of LSD-1 induces JNK signaling pathway-dependent abnormal development of thorax and apoptosis cell death in Drosophila melanogaster. Perilipins are evolutionarily conserved from insects to mammals. Lipid storage droplet-1 (LSD-1) is a member of the lipid droplet's surface-binding protein family and counterpart to mammalian perilipin 1. The role of LSD-1 has already been reported in lipid metabolism of Drosophila. However, the function of this gene during specific tissue development is still under investigation. Here, we found that LSD-1 is expressed in the notum of the wing imaginal disc, and notum-specific knockdown of Lsd-1 by pannir-GAL4 driver leads to split thorax phenotype in adults, suggesting an essential role of LSD-1 in development of Drosophila thorax. As overexpression of JNK homolog, bsk (basket) suppresses Lsd-1 knockdown phenotype, the role of LSD-1 in thorax development was proved to be dependent on the activity of the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The puckered (puc) expression led to significant decrease in the JNK activity in wing discs of Lsd-1 knockdown flies. In addition, we also detected that depletion of Lsd-1 enhances apoptotic cell death in the wing notum area. Taken together, these data demonstrated that LSD-1 functions in Drosophila thorax development by regulating JNK pathway. "
positive,"Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus modulates innate immune suppression through the eIF4E-eIF4A axis in the insect Spodoptera litura. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is regulated during the innate immune response. However, its translational regulation under innate immune suppression remains largely unexplored. Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV), a symbiotic virus harbored by the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus, suppresses innate immunity in parasitized Spodoptera litura. Here, we generated eIF4E dsRNA and used it to silence the eIF4E gene of S. litura, resulting in a hallmark immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased apoptosis of hemocytes and retardation of head capsule width development. In response to natural parasitism, loss of eIF4E function was associated with similar immunosuppression, and we detected no significant differences between the response to parasitism and treatment with eIF4E RNAi. Under MbBV infection, eIF4E overexpression significantly suppressed MbBV-induced increase in apoptosis and suppressed apoptosis to the same extent as co-expression of both eIF4E and eIF4A. There were no significant differences between MbBV-infected and uninfected larvae in which eIF4E was overexpressed. More importantly, in the eIF4E RNAi strain, eIF4A RNAi did not increase apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicate that eIF4E plays a nodal role in the MbBV-suppressed innate immune response via the eIF4E-eIF4A axis. "
positive,"In situ hybridization to the Rdl locus on polytene chromosome 3L of Anopheles stephensi. We are interested in generating a Y-autosome translocation of the Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) locus in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae), for use in sterile insect release. To ensure stability of the system, a recombination suppressing inversion can also be induced which encompasses the Rdl locus. As a first step, here we report the cloning of fragments of the Rdl gene from both An. stephensi and An. gambiae Giles using degenerate primers in the polymerase chain reaction. These fragments encode the second membrane-spanning region of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor and show high levels of both nucleotide and predicted amino acid identity to other Rdl-like receptors. They confirm that, as in all other arthropod species examined, dieldrin resistance in An. stephensi is associated with replacement of alanine302, in this case with a serine. In situ hybridization of the Rdl probe to polytene chromosomes of An. stephensi localizes the gene to the left arm of chromosome 3 (3L) in region 45C. Rdl localization will enable us to identify chromosomal rearrangements encompassing the Rdl locus and help anchor the genome sequence of An. gambiae to the polytene map. "
negative,"Beetle genomes in the 21st century: prospects, progress and priorities. The order Coleoptera (beetles) is arguably the most species-rich lineage of animals. Beetles exhibit an extraordinary variety of life histories and occupy most terrestrial environments. Whole genome sequences are available for 11 beetle species, only six of which have been published. Studies of beetle genomes have revealed remarkable new insights into the genomic basis and evolution of beetle life histories and other aspects of beetle biodiversity, including the genes underlying chemoperception, detoxification, and specialized plant feeding, as well as the role of horizontal gene transfer in elaboration of the beetle trophic repertoire. Nonetheless, such studies are in their infancy. The study of beetle genomes has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of beetle biodiversity, but genomic studies of beetles remain seriously limited in scope and resolution by the very few genomes that are currently available for study. "
positive,"Identification and RNAi-based function analysis of chitinase family genes in diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. BACKGROUND: Insect chitinases play a vital part in chitin degradation in exoskeletons and gut linings during the molting process, and therefore are considered potential targets for new insecticide designs or RNA interference (RNAi)-based pest management. Systematic functional analysis of chitinase genes has already been conducted in several insect pests, but not Plutella xylostella. RESULTS: In this study, 13 full-length chitinase transcripts were obtained in P. xylostella. Developmental and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis revealed that seven chitinase transcripts were periodically expressed during molting stage and mainly expressed in the integument or midgut, including PxCht3, PxCht5, PxCht6-2, PxCht7, PxCht8, PxCht10 and PxCht-h. RNAi-mediated knockdown of these specific expressed genes revealed that PxCht5 and PxCht10 were essential in larval molting, pupation and eclosion, and PxCht7 was indispensable only in eclosion. No significant effects were observed on insect survival or normal development when the rest chitinase transcripts were suppressed by RNAi. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated the function of P. xylostella chitinase family genes during the molting process, and may provide potential targets for RNAi-based management of P. xylostella. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"The genome of the stick insect Medauroidea extradentata is strongly methylated within genes and repetitive DNA. BACKGROUND: Cytosine DNA methylation has been detected in many eukaryotic organisms and has been shown to play an important role in development and disease of vertebrates including humans. Molecularly, DNA methylation appears to be involved in the suppression of initiation or of elongation of transcription. Resulting organismal functions are suggested to be the regulation of gene silencing, the suppression of transposon activity and the suppression of initiation of transcription within genes. However, some data concerning the distribution of methylcytosine in insect species appear to contradict such roles. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By comparison of MspI and HpaII restriction patterns in genomic DNA of several insects we show that stick insects (Phasmatodea) have highly methylated genomes. We isolated methylated DNA fragments from the Vietnamese Walking Stick Medauroidea extradentata (formerly known as Baculum extradentatum) and demonstrated that most of the corresponding sequences are repetitive. Bisulfite sequencing of one of these fragments and of parts of conserved protein-coding genes revealed a methylcytosine content of 12.6%, mostly found at CpG, but also at CpT and CpA dinucleotides. Corresponding depletions of CpG and enrichments of TpG and CpA dinucleotides in some highly conserved protein-coding genes of Medauroidea reach a similar degree as in vertebrates and show that CpG methylation has occurred in the germline of these insects. CONCLUSIONS: Using four different methods, we demonstrate that the genome of Medauroidea extradentata is strongly methylated. Both repetitive DNA and coding genes appear to contain high levels of methylcytosines. These results argue for similar functions of DNA methylation in stick insects as those already known for vertebrates. "
negative,"Simplify, simplify: Lifestyle and compact genome of the body louse provide a unique functional genomics opportunity. The body louse, with its recently sequenced genome, is now primed to serve as a powerful model organism for addressing fundamental questions relating to how insects interact with their environment. One characteristic of the body louse that facilitates this research is the size of its genome-the smallest insect genome sequenced to date. This diminutive genome must nonetheless control an organism that senses and responds to its environment, reacting to threats of corporal and genomic integrity. Additionally, the body louse transmits several important human diseases compared to its very close relative, the head louse, which does not. Therefore, these two organisms comprise an excellent model system for studying molecular mechanisms associated with vector competence. To understand more fully the development of vector / pathogen interactions, we have developed an in vitro bioassay system and determined that the body louse genome appears to contain the genes necessary for RNAi. The body louse will therefore be useful for determining the set of conditions permissive to the evolution of vector competence. "
positive,"Physiological functions of a methuselah-like G protein coupled receptor in Lymantria dispar Linnaeus. Insect G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified as a highly attractive target for new generation insecticides discovery due to their critical physiological functions. However, few insect GPCRs have been functionally characterized. Here, we cloned the full length of a methuselah-like GPCR gene (Ldmthl1) from the Asian gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. We then characterized the secondary and tertiary structures of Ldmthl1. We also predicted the global structure of this insect GPCR protein which is composed of three major domains. RNA interference of Ldmthl1 resulted in a reduction of gypsy moths' resistance to deltamethrin and suppressed expression of downstream stress-associated genes, such as P450s, glutathione S transferases, and heat shock proteins. The function of Ldmthl1 was further investigated using transgenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila with overexpression of Ldmthl1 showed significantly longer lifespan than control flies. Taken together, our studies revealed that the physiological functions of Ldmthl1 in L. dispar are associated with longevity and resistance to insecticide stresses. Potentially, Ldmthl1 can be used as a target for new insecticide discovery in order to manage this notorious forest pest. "
negative,"Genomic evidence of genetic variation with pleiotropic effects on caterpillar fitness and plant traits in a model legume. Plant-insect interactions are ubiquitous, and have been studied intensely because of their relevance to damage and pollination in agricultural plants, and to the ecology and evolution of biodiversity. Variation within species can affect the outcome of these interactions. Specific genes and chemicals that mediate these interactions have been identified, but genome- or metabolome-scale studies might be necessary to better understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of intraspecific variation for plant-insect interactions. Here, we present such a study. Specifically, we assess the consequences of genome-wide genetic variation in the model plant Medicago truncatula for Lycaeides melissa caterpillar growth and survival (larval performance). Using a rearing experiment and a whole-genome SNP data set (>5 million SNPs), we found that polygenic variation in M. truncatula explains 9%-41% of the observed variation in caterpillar growth and survival. Genetic correlations among caterpillar performance and other plant traits, including structural defences and some anonymous chemical features, suggest that multiple M. truncatula alleles have pleiotropic effects on plant traits and caterpillar performance (or that substantial linkage disequilibrium exists among distinct loci affecting subsets of these traits). A moderate proportion of the genetic effect of M. truncatula alleles on L. melissa performance can be explained by the effect of these alleles on the plant traits we measured, especially leaf toughness. Taken together, our results show that intraspecific genetic variation in M. truncatula has a substantial effect on the successful development of L. melissa caterpillars (i.e., on a plant-insect interaction), and further point toward traits potentially mediating this genetic effect. "
negative,"Application of a dense genetic map for assessment of genomic responses to selection and inbreeding in Heliothis virescens. Adaptation of pest species to laboratory conditions and selection for resistance to toxins in the laboratory are expected to cause inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Heliothis virescens, a major cotton pest, has been colonized in the laboratory many times, and a few laboratory colonies have been selected for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) resistance. We developed 350-bp double-digest restriction-site associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) molecular markers to examine and compare changes in genetic variation associated with laboratory adaptation, artificial selection and inbreeding in this nonmodel insect species. We found that allelic and nucleotide diversity declined dramatically in laboratory-reared H. virescens as compared with field-collected populations. The declines were primarily a result of the loss of low frequency alleles present in field-collected H. virescens. A further, albeit modest decline in genetic diversity was observed in a Bt-selected population. The greatest decline was seen in H. virescens that were sib-mated for 10 generations, in which more than 80% of loci were fixed for a single allele. To determine which regions of the genome were resistant to fixation in our sib-mated line, we generated a dense intraspecific linkage map containing three PCR-based and 659 ddRAD-seq markers. Markers that retained polymorphism were observed in small clusters spread over multiple linkage groups, but this clustering was not statistically significant. Overall, we have confirmed and extended the general expectations for reduced genetic diversity in laboratory colonies, provided tools for further genomic analyses and produced highly homozygous genomic DNA for future whole genome sequencing of H. virescens. "
positive,"Characterization of a broad-based mosquito yeast interfering RNA larvicide with a conserved target site in mosquito semaphorin-1a genes. BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi), which has facilitated functional characterization of mosquito neural development genes such as the axon guidance regulator semaphorin-1a (sema1a), could one day be applied as a new means of vector control. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) may represent an effective interfering RNA expression system that could be used directly for delivery of RNA pesticides to mosquito larvae. Here we describe characterization of a yeast larvicide developed through bioengineering of S. cerevisiae to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a conserved site in mosquito sema1a genes. RESULTS: Experiments conducted on Aedes aegypti larvae demonstrated that the yeast larvicide effectively silences sema1a expression, generates severe neural defects, and induces high levels of larval mortality in laboratory, simulated-field, and semi-field experiments. The larvicide was also found to induce high levels of Aedes albopictus, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies indicate that use of yeast interfering RNA larvicides targeting mosquito sema1a genes may represent a new biorational tool for mosquito control. "
negative,"Evolutionary analysis of herbivorous insects in natural and agricultural environments. Herbivorous insects offer a remarkable example of the biological diversity that formed the foundation for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The ability of insects to evolve resistance rapidly to insecticides and host-plant resistance present a continual challenge for pest management. This paper considers the manner in which genetic constraints, host-plant availability and trade-offs affect the evolution of herbivorous insects in natural and agricultural environments, and the extent to which lessons learned from studying natural systems may be applied to improve insect resistance management in agricultural systems. Studies on the genetic architecture of adaptation by herbivores to host plants and to insecticides are reviewed. The genetic basis of resistance is an important component of simulation models that predict the evolution of resistance. These models often assume monogenic resistance, but available data suggest that this assumption may be overly narrow and that modeling of resistance as oligogenic or polygenic may be more appropriate. As omics (e.g. genomics and proteomics) technologies become more accessible, a better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance will be possible. Trade-offs often accompany adaptations by herbivores. Trade-offs arise when the benefit of a trait, such as the ability to feed on a novel host plant or to survive in the presence of an insecticide, is counterbalanced by fitness costs that decrease fitness in the absence of the selective agent. For resistance to insecticides, and resistance to insecticidal transgenic crops in particular, fitness costs may act as an evolutionary constraint and delay or prevent the evolution of resistance. An important observation is that certain ecological factors such as host plants and entomopathogens can magnify fitness costs, which is termed ecological negative cross-resistance. The application of omics technologies may allow for more efficient identification of factors that will impose ecological negative cross-resistance, thereby bolstering insect resistance management. "
negative,"The PKA-CREB system encoded by the honeybee genome. The cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) plays a crucial part in long-term memory formation in the honeybee (Apis mellifera). One of the putative substrates of the PKA activity is the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor in the bZIP protein family. We searched the honeybee genome to characterize genes from the CREB / CREM and the PKA families. We identified two genes that encode regulatory subunits and three genes encode catalytic subunits of PKA. Eight genes code for bZIP proteins, but only one gene was found that encodes a member of the CREB / CREM family. The phylogenetic relationship of these genes was analysed with their Drosophila and human counterparts. "
negative,"Construction and application of an HSP70 promoter-inducible genome editing system in transgenic silkworm to induce resistance to Nosema bombycis. The microsporidian Nosema bombycis is an obligate intracellular parasitic fungus that causes devastating disease in sericulture. To date, no efficient biotechnological method to inhibit the proliferation of microspores has been established. Here, we developed a powerful genetic engineering technique involving microsporidia-inducible genome editing in transgenic silkworm that confers resistance to N. bombycis. This system includes an HSP70 promoter-induced expression of the Cas9 protein line and a target BmATAD3A gene line. The double-positive HSP70-Cas9(+)×sgATAD3A(+) lines were obtained by hybridization and activation of the CRISPR / Cas9 system under the condition of microsporidia infection, although it is silenced in uninfected individuals. Genome editing analysis showed that the system could efficiently edit the BmATAD3A gene and induce large deletions. It is notable that the HSP70-induced system could effectively improve the survival rate of transgenic silkworm after microsporidia infection and inhibit the expression of key microsporidia genes. Moreover, no significant developmental differences between the transgenic silkworms infected with microsporidia and normal individuals were observed. In this study, we effectively inhibited microsporidia proliferation in transgenic individuals through disruptive techniques, thereby providing a method for microsporidia treatment and prevention, paving the way for economically advantageous insect breeding. "
positive,"Bombyxin / Akt signaling in relation to the embryonic diapause process of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Our previous study showed that phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β is related to the embryonic diapause process in Bombyx. However, the upstream signaling pathway was not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined bombyxin / Akt signaling in relation to the embryonic diapause process of B. mori. Results showed that GSK-3β phosphorylation stimulated by dechorionation was blocked by LY294002, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, indicating involvement of PI3K in GSK-3β phosphorylation in dechorionated eggs. Direct determination of Akt phosphorylation showed that dechorionation stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The Akt phosphorylation was blocked by LY294002. Temporal changes in Akt phosphorylation showed that different changing patterns exist between diapause and developing eggs. Relatively higher phosphorylation levels of Akt were detected between days 3 and 5 after oviposition in non-diapause eggs compared to those at the same stages in diapause eggs. Upon treatment with HCl, which prevents diapause initiation, Akt phosphorylation levels exhibited a later and much broader peak compared to diapause eggs. Examination of expression levels of the bombyxin-Z1 gene showed that in diapause eggs, a major peak occurred 1 day after oviposition, and its level then sharply decreased on day 2. However, in both non-diapause and HCl-treated eggs, a major broad peak was detected between days 1 and 4 after oviposition. These temporal changes in bombyxin-Z1 gene expression levels during embryonic stages coincided with changes in Akt phosphorylation, indicating that bombyxin-Z1 is likely an upstream signaling component for Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicated that PI3K / Akt is an upstream signaling pathway for GSK-3β phosphorylation and is associated with the diapause process of B. mori eggs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential correlation between bombyxin / Akt signaling and the embryonic diapause process. "
negative,"Construction and long term preservation of clonal transgenic silkworms using a parthenogenetic strain. For the functional analysis of insect genes as well as for the production of recombinant proteins for biomedical use, clonal transgenic silkworms are very useful. We examined if they could be produced in the parthenogenetic strain that had been maintained for more than 40years as a female line in which embryogenesis is induced with nearly 100% efficiency by a heat shock treatment of unfertilized eggs. All individuals have identical female genotype. Silkworm transgenesis requires injection of the DNA constructs into the non-diapausing eggs at the preblastodermal stage of embryogenesis. Since our parthenogenetic silkworms produce diapausing eggs, diapause programing was eliminated by incubating ovaries of the parthenogenetic strain in standard male larvae. Chorionated eggs were dissected from the implants, activated by the heat shock treatment and injected with the transgene construct. Several transgenic individuals occurred in the daughter generation. Southern blotting analysis of two randomly chosen transgenic lines VTG1 and VTG14 revealed multiple transgene insertions. Insertions found in the parental females were transferred to the next generation without any changes in their sites and copy numbers, suggesting that transgenic silkworms can be maintained as clonal strains with homozygous transgenes. Cryopreservation was developed for the storage of precious genotypes. As shown for the VTG1 and VTG14 lines, larval ovaries can be stored in DMSO at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, transferred to Grace's medium during defrosting, and then implanted into larvae of either sex of the standard silkworm strains C146 and w1-pnd. Chorionated eggs, which developed in the implants, were dissected and activated by the heat shock to obtain females (nearly 100% efficiency) or by a cold shock to induce development to both sexes in 4% of the eggs. It was then possible to establish bisexual lines homozygous for the transgene.  "
negative,"Genomic evidence for complementary purine metabolism in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. The purine salvage pathway recycles purines to nucleotides, promoting efficient utilization of purine nucleotides. Exceptionally among animals with completely sequenced genomes, the pea aphid lacks key purine recycling genes that code for purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase, indicating that the aphid can neither metabolize nucleosides to the corresponding purines, nor adenosine to inosine. Purine metabolism genes in the symbiotic bacterium Buchnera complement aphid genes, and Buchnera can meet its nucleotide requirement from aphid-derived guanosine. Buchnera demand for nucleosides may have relaxed the selection for purine recycling in the aphid, leading to the loss of key aphid purine salvage genes. Further, the coupled purine metabolism of aphid and Buchnera could contribute to the dependence of the pea aphid on this symbiosis. "
positive,"Primary structure of apolipophorin-III from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Potential amphipathic structures and molecular evolution of an insect apolipoprotein. The amino acid sequence of an insect apolipoprotein, apolipophorin-III from Locusta migratoria, has been deduced from the sequence of its cloned cDNA. The mature hemolymph protein consists of 161 amino acids. Optimized alignments of this protein with apolipophorin-III from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, disclosed an overall sequence identity of only 29%, even though the two proteins are functionally equivalent. The L. migratoria sequence is composed of 12 repeating peptides that are variable in length. Six amphipathic helical segments of varying length were identified in each protein using a newly described algorithm for detecting such secondary structures. The degree of sequence identity between the two insect apoproteins is considerably less than that observed among orthologous mammalian apolipoproteins. However, calculation of the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions indicates that the insect genes may be evolving at rates similar to the mammalian apolipoprotein genes. Further comparative analyses of insect and mammalian apolipoproteins should provide insights about the limits of sequence diversity tolerated by their predicted amphipathic helical domains. "
positive,"Brownie, a gene involved in building complex respiratory devices in insect eggshells. BACKGROUND: Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for respiration and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the follicle cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicate that the novel gene Brownie plays a pivotal role in building up the sponge-like body. Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures. "
positive,"The expression of cockroach insulin-like peptides is differentially regulated by physiological conditions and affected by compensatory regulation. In insects, the insulin receptor (InR) pathway is involved in regulating key physiological processes, including juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis, vitellogenin production, and oocyte growth. This raises the question about which ligand (or ligands) binds to InR to trigger the above effects. We have cloned seven insulin-like peptides (BgILP1 to 7) from female Blattella germanica cockroaches and found that the brain expresses BgILP1 to 6, the fat body BgILP7, and the ovary BgILP2. Starvation induces the reduction of BgILP3, 5, and 6 mRNA levels in the brain, and the various BgILPs are differentially expressed during the gonadotrophic cycle. In addition, by knocking down the BgILPs we were able to identify compensatory regulation at transcriptional level between the different BgILPs, although none of the BgILP knockdown assays, including the knockdown of the seven BgILPs, produced the same phenotypes that we achieved by depleting InR. Taken together, the results indicate that B. germanica ILPs are differentially expressed in tissues and in response to physiological conditions, and that they are affected by compensatory regulation. "
negative,"Copy number variations among silkworms. BACKGROUND: Copy number variations (CNVs), which are important source for genetic and phenotypic variation, have been shown to be associated with disease as well as important QTLs, especially in domesticated animals. However, little is known about the CNVs in silkworm. RESULTS: In this study, we have constructed the first CNVs map based on genome-wide analysis of CNVs in domesticated silkworm. Using next-generation sequencing as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR), we identified ~319 CNVs in total and almost half of them (~ 49%) were distributed on uncharacterized chromosome. The CNVs covered 10.8 Mb, which is about 2.3% of the entire silkworm genome. Furthermore, approximately 61% of CNVs directly overlapped with SDs in silkworm. The genes in CNVs are mainly related to reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition, which is consistent with the observations in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: An initial CNVs map for silkworm has been described in this study. And this map provides new information for genetic variations in silkworm. Furthermore, the silkworm CNVs may play important roles in reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition. This study provided insight into the evolution of the silkworm genome and an invaluable resource for insect genomics research. "
negative,"Baculovirus diversity and molecular biology. With the identification and characterization of a number of structural and nonstructural protein genes, advances have been made in our understanding of baculovirus structure, regulation of gene expression, and replication. Since less than 30% of the AcMNPV genome has been sequenced and characterized, the continued identification and assignment of function to baculovirus genes is perhaps the most crucial of enterprises now facing baculovirologists and is critical to the development of our understanding of the baculovirus genome and its replication. The size and diversity of baculovirus genomes appears to be strongly influenced by mobile DNA from the insect host. Also, transposon-mediated mutations of baculoviruses provide examples of functional inactivation of viral genes (FP phenotype mutations) and transcriptional activation (TE-D insertion). Another role transposable elements may play is the introduction of insect promoters and enhancers to the baculovirus genome. Since early baculovirus genes are likely transcribed in a way similar to normal insect genes, transposons that insert strong constitutive promoters or cellular enhancers near early baculovirus genes may cause mutations that are subsequently selected for. If this does occur, baculovirus early gene promoters may exhibit a great deal of variability in sequence and may resemble host promoters. Given the overall similarity between the genomes of OpMNPV and AcMNPV and the apparent absence of a region, similar to the AcMNPV HindIII-K / EcoR1-S in OpMNPV, it is intriguing to speculate that this region which contains two ORFs and the hr5 enhancer, may have been inserted into the AcMNPV genome by transposition, possibly delivering several helpful genes (35k and 94k) and a powerful enhancer. The highly repeated enhancer may have been subsequently amplified by recombination. In such a model, the acquisition of general or species-specific enhancers might influence both virulence and host range. Acquisition of general enhancers could increase the level of early gene expression, thus accelerating the cellular infection cycle and making the virus more virulent. Similarly, the acquisition of species-specific enhancers might affect host range by accelerating the infection cycle, but only in a specific host or cell type. One might therefore postulate that diversity in baculoviruses may reflect not only different selection pressures but also the diversity of mobile DNA within host insect species. Although our understanding of baculovirus diversity and molecular biology is rapidly advancing, many of the fundamental characteristics that define the unique nature of baculoviruses remain poorly understood. One fundamental feature of baculoviruses is the production of the two virion phenotypes, PDV and BV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
positive,"DDC plays vital roles in the wing spot formation, egg production, and chorion tanning in the brown planthopper. The gene dopa decarboxylase (Nlddc) of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) was identified in the genome and transcriptome of the insect. The open reading frame of Nlddc is 1,434 bp in length and, it has the potential to encode a protein of 477 amino acid with a conserved pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain and a typical motif, NFNPHKW. Real-time quantification polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that this gene was highly expressed in the integument and brain, and transcript level peaked in the late stages of egg period and each nymph instar with periodicity. RNA interference results revealed that Nlddc played essential roles in pigment synthesis, formation of wing spot, egg production, and tanning of the chorion. A rapid accumulation of Nlddc transcripts was detected, and it coincided with the injection of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), suggesting that Nlddc transcription was regulated by 20E. "
positive,"Identification of chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome of Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella. Olfaction plays an indispensable role in mediating insect behavior, such as locating host plants, mating partners, and avoidance of toxins and predators. Olfactory-related proteins are required for olfactory perception of insects. However, very few olfactory-related genes have been reported in Plodia interpunctella up to now. In the present study, we sequenced the antennae transcriptome of P. interpunctella using the next-generation sequencing technology, and identified 117 candidate olfactory-related genes, including 29 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), three sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 47 odorant receptors (ORs), 14 ionotropic receptors (IRs) and nine gustatory receptors (GRs). Further analysis of qRT-PCR revealed that nine OBPs, three CSPs, two SNMPs, nine ORs and two GRs were specifically expressed in the male antennae, whereas eight OBPs, six CSPs, one SNMP, 16 ORs, two GRs and seven IRs significantly expressed in the female antennae. Taken together, our results provided useful information for further functional studies on insect genes related to recognition of pheromone and odorant, which might be meaningful targets for pest management. "
negative,"piggyBac-based insertional mutagenesis and enhancer detection as a tool for functional insect genomics. Transposon mutagenesis provides a fundamental tool for functional genomics. Here we present a non-species-specific, combined enhancer detection and binary expression system based on the transposable element piggyBac: For the different components of this insertional mutagenesis system, we used widely applicable transposons and distinguishable broad-range transformation markers, which should enable this system to be operational in nonmodel arthropods. In a pilot screen in Drosophila melanogaster, piggyBac mutator elements on the X chromosome were mobilized in males by a Hermes-based jumpstarter element providing piggyBac transposase activity under control of the alpha1-tubulin promoter. As primary reporters in the piggyBac mutator elements, we employed the heterologous transactivators GAL4delta or tTA. To identify larval and adult enhancer detectors, strains carrying UASp-EYFP or TRE-EYFP as secondary reporter elements were used. Tissue-specific enhancer activities were readily observed in the GAL4delta / UASp-based systems, but only rarely in the tTA / TRE system. Novel autosomal insertions were recovered with an average jumping rate of 80%. Of these novel insertions, 3.8% showed homozygous lethality, which was reversible by piggyBac excision. Insertions were found in both coding and noncoding regions of characterized genes and also in noncharacterized and non-P-targeted CG-number genes. This indicates that piggyBac will greatly facilitate the intended saturation mutagenesis in Drosophila. "
negative,"Complete sequences of mitochondria genomes of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus and comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA fragments inserted in the nuclear genomes. We present complete sequences of the mitochondrial genomes for two important mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, that are major vectors of dengue virus and lymphatic filariasis, respectively. The A. aegypti mitochondrial genome is 16,655 bp in length and that of C. quinquefasciatus is 15,587 bp, yet both contain 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, one 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, one 16S rRNA gene and a control region (CR) in the same order. The difference in the genome size is due to the difference in the length of the control region. We also analyzed insertions of nuclear copies of mtDNA-like sequences (NUMTs) in a comparative manner between the two mosquitoes. The NUMT sequences occupy ~0.008% of the A. aegypti genome and ~0.001% of the C. quinquefasciatus genome. Several NUMTs were found localized in the introns of predicted protein coding genes in both genomes (32 genes in A. aegypti but only four in C. quinquefasciatus). None of these NUMT-containing genes had an ortholog between the two species or had paralogous copies within a genome that was also NUMT-containing. It was further observed that the NUMT-containing genes were relatively longer but had lower GC content compared to the NUMT-less paralogous copies. Moreover, stretches of homologies are present among the genic and non-genic NUMTs that may play important roles in genomic rearrangement of NUMTs in these genomes. Our study provides new insights on understanding the roles of nuclear mtDNA sequences in genome complexities of these mosquitoes. "
negative,"Large-scale recoding of an arbovirus genome to rebalance its insect versus mammalian preference. The protein synthesis machineries of two distinct phyla of the Animal kingdom, insects of Arthropoda and mammals of Chordata, have different preferences for how to best encode proteins. Nevertheless, arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are capable of infecting both mammals and insects just like arboviruses that use insect vectors to infect plants. These organisms have evolved carefully balanced genomes that can efficiently use the translational machineries of different phyla, even if the phyla belong to different kingdoms. Using dengue virus as an example, we have undone the genome encoding balance and specifically shifted the encoding preference away from mammals. These mammalian-attenuated viruses grow to high titers in insect cells but low titers in mammalian cells, have dramatically increased LD50s in newborn mice, and induce high levels of protective antibodies. Recoded arboviruses with a bias toward phylum-specific expression could form the basis of a new generation of live attenuated vaccine candidates.  "
positive,"karmoisin and cardinal ortholog genes participate in the ommochrome synthesis of Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Ommochrome is the major source for eye coloration of all insect species so far examined. Phenoxazinone synthetase (PHS) has always been regarded as the terminal step enzyme for ommochrome formation, which is encoded by cardinal or karmoisin genes. Our previous study indicated that the karmoisin ortholog gene (Nl-karmoisin) product in the brown planthopper (BPH) was a monocarboxylate transporter, while not a PHS. Here, based on full-length complementary DNA, the cardinal ortholog gene in BPH (Nl-cardinal) product was predicted to be a haem peroxidase rather than a PHS. We suggest for the first time that neither karmoisin nor cardinal encodes the PHS, but whether PHS participates in BPH eye pigmentation needs further research. Nymphal RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that knockdown Nl-cardinal transcript led the BPH ocelli and compound eye to color change from brown to red, while knockdown Nl-karmoisin only made the ocelli present the red phenotype. Notably, not only the Nl-cardinal transcript, dscd injection (Nl-cardinal targeting double-stranded DNA (dsRNA)) also significantly reduced the Nl-karmoisin transcript by 33.7%, while dska (Nl-karmoisin targeting dsRNA) injection did not significantly change the Nl-cardinal transcript. Considering the above RNAi and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results, we propose that Nl-cardinal plays a more important role in ommochrome synthesis than Nl-karmoisin, and it may be an upstream gene of Nl-karmoisin. The present study suggested that both karmoisin and cardinal ortholog genes play a role in ommochrome synthesis in a hemimetabolous insect. "
negative,"Identification of a cDNA encoding a retinoid X receptor homologue from Schistosoma mansoni. Evidence for a role in female-specific gene expression. Schistosoma mansoni, a multicelluar eukaryotic blood fluke, is a major cause of morbidity worldwide in humans. The study of female parasite growth, development, and gene regulation is important because the eggs produced are responsible for the pathogenesis observed in schistosomiasis. p14, an eggshell precursor gene expressed only in sexually mature females in response to a male stimulus, is a model for female-specific gene regulation. The upstream region of the p14 gene shares sequences present in insect genes known to be regulated in a sex-, temporal-, and tissue-specific manner by members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a cDNA that encodes the S. mansoni (Sm) RXR homologue. Sequence analysis predicts and Western blot analysis confirms the synthesis of a 74-kDa protein, the largest member of the RXR family reported to date. We show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis that SmRXR binds to cis-elements of the p14 gene including a direct repeat that follows the ""3-4-5"" rule of binding elements recognized by members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SmRXR can act as a transcription activator in the yeast one-hybrid system. Through quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show that the SmRXR gene is constitutively expressed and thus must play multiple roles throughout the schistosome life cycle. "
negative,"Influence of host plant, geography and pheromone strain on genomic differentiation in sympatric populations of Ostrinia nubilalis. Patterns of mating for the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) moth depend in part on variation in sex-pheromone blend. The ratio of (E)-11- and (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11- and Z11-14:OAc) in the pheromone blend that females produce and males respond to differs between strains of O. nubilalis. Populations also vary in female oviposition preference for and larval performance on maize (C4) and nonmaize (C3) host plants. The relative contributions of sexual and ecological trait variation to the genetic structure of O. nubilalis remains unknown. Host-plant use (13 C / 14 C ratios) and genetic differentiation were estimated among sympatric E and Z pheromone strain O. nubilalis males collected in sex-pheromone baited traps at 12 locations in Pennsylvania and New York between 2007 and 2010. Among genotypes at 65 single nucleotide polymorphism marker loci, variance at a position in the pheromone gland fatty acyl-reductase (pgfar) gene at the locus responsible for determining female pheromone ratio (Pher) explained 64% of the total genetic differentiation between males attracted to different pheromones (male response, Resp), providing evidence of sexual inter-selection at these unlinked loci. Principal coordinate, Bayesian clustering, and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) demonstrate that host plant history or geography does not significantly contribute to population variation or differentiation among males. In contrast, these analyses indicate that pheromone response and pgfar-defined strain contribute significantly to population genetic differentiation. This study suggests that behavioural divergence probably plays a larger role in driving genetic variation compared to host plant-defined ecological adaptation. "
negative,"Evidence for involvement of a transformer paralogue in sex determination of the wasp Leptopilina clavipes. Transformer (tra) is the central gear in many insect sex determination pathways and transduces a wide range of primary signals. Mediated by transformer-2 (tra2) it directs sexual development into the female or male mode. Duplications of tra have been detected in numerous Hymenoptera, but a function in sex determination has been confirmed only in Apis mellifera. We identified a tra2 orthologue (Lc-tra2), a tra orthologue (Lc-tra) and a tra paralogue (Lc-traB) in the genome of Leptopilina clavipes (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae). We compared the sequence and structural conservation of these genes between sexual (arrhenotokous) and asexual all-female producing (thelytokous) individuals. Lc-tra is sex-specifically spliced in adults consistent with its orthologous function. The male-specific regions of Lc-tra are conserved in both reproductive modes. The paralogue Lc-traB lacks the genomic region coding for male-specific exons and can only be translated into a full-length TRA-like peptide sequence. Furthermore, unlike LC-TRA, the LC-TRAB interstrain sequence variation is not differentiated into a sexual and an asexual haplotype. The LC-TRAB protein interacts with LC-TRA as well as LC-TRA2. This suggests that Lc-traB functions as a conserved element in sex determination of sexual and asexual individuals. "
positive,"Functional analysis by RNAi of an glutaredoxin gene in Helicoverpa armigera. Glutaredoxins play crucial roles in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis via scavenging of excess reactive oxygen species. In this study, a glutaredoxin domain-containing cysteine-rich gene from Helicoverpa armigera, named HaGdccr, was characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that it contains a glutaredoxin domain and a conserved cysteine and shares high sequence identity with other insect genes. HaGdccr mRNA expression was highest in molting larvae of the 3rd instar and was mainly detected in the central nervous system of larvae and the wings of adults. Quantitative real-time PCR results revealed that the expression of HaGdccr was suppressed at 1 and 6 h and increased at 24 h after the larvae were treated with 4 °C and hydrogen peroxide. When the larvae were exposed to 20 °C, HaGdccr decreased at 1 h and was induced at 12 and 24 h. HaGdccr transcription level was downregulated at 2 and 12 h and upregulated at 24 h after the adults were exposed to 0 °C. However, transcript levels were increased by high temperature in both larvae and adults. After knockdown of HaGdccr by RNA interference, the expression of antioxidant genes, including thioredoxin-like (Trx-like), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin (Trx), was increased, whereas that of thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) was decreased. In addition, we found that HaGdccr knockdown enhanced the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and the contents of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate. Taken together, these results indicate that HaGdccr may play significant roles in protecting organisms against oxidative damage. "
negative,"Peripheral olfactory signaling in insects. Olfactory signaling is a crucial component in the life history of insects. The development of precise and parallel mechanisms to analyze the tremendous amount of chemical information from the environment and other sources has been essential to their evolutionary success. Considerable progress has been made in the study of insect olfaction fueled by bioinformatics- based utilization of genomics along with rapid advances in functional analyses. Here we review recent progress in our rapidly emerging understanding of insect peripheral sensory reception and signal transduction. These studies reveal that the nearly unlimited chemical space insects encounter is covered by distinct chemosensory receptor repertoires that are generally derived by species-specific, rapid gene gain and loss, reflecting the evolutionary consequences of adaptation to meet their specific biological needs. While diverse molecular mechanisms have been put forth, often in the context of controversial models, the characterization of the ubiquitous, highly conserved and insect-specific Orco odorant receptor co-receptor has opened the door to the design and development of novel insect control methods to target agricultural pests, disease vectors and even nuisance insects. "
positive,"The NompC channel regulates Nilaparvata lugens proprioception and gentle-touch response. NompC channel is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily. It can regulate gentle-touch, locomotion, hearing and food texture detection in Drosophila. We cloned the NompC gene of Nilaparvata lugens (NlNompC). The full length NlNompC possessed similar structure as DmNompC, which belongs to TRPN subfamily. The expression pattern analysis of different developmental stages and body parts showed that the transcription of NlNompC was more abundant in adult stage and in the abdomen. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of NlNompC in the third-instar nymphs successfully knocked down the target gene with 75% suppression. At nine days after injection, the survival rate of dsRNA injected nymphs was as low as 9.84%. Behavioral observation revealed that the locomotion of the dsRNA injected nymphs was defective with much less movement compared to the negative control. Feeding and honeydew excretion of the dsRNA injected insects also decreased significantly. These results suggested that NlNompC is a classical mechanotransduction channel that plays important roles in proprioception and locomotion, and is essential for the survival of N. lugens. The results also contribute to the understanding of how TRP channels regulate proprioception. "
positive,"Disruption of sex-specific doublesex exons results in male- and female-specific defects in the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. BACKGROUND: Doublesex (dsx), the downstream gene in the insect sex-determination pathway, is a key regulator of sexually dimorphic development and behavior across a variety of insects. Manipulating expression of dsx could be useful in the genetic control of insects. However, information on the sex-specific function of dsx in non-model insects is lacking. RESULTS: In this work, we isolated a dsx homolog, which is alternatively spliced into six female-specific and one male-specific isoforms, from an important agricultural pest, the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon. Studies on the expression of sex-specific Aidsx mRNA during embryonic development showed that the sixth hour post oviposition is the key stage for sex determination in A. ipsilon. Functional analysis of Aidsx was conducted using a CRISPR / Cas9 system targeting female- and male-specific Aidsx exons. Disruptions of sex-specific Aidsx exons resulted in sex-specific, sexually dimorphic defects in external genitals, gonads and antennae, and expression of sex-specific genes as well as production of offspring in both sexes. CONCLUSION: Our results not only demonstrate that dsx is a key player determining A. ipsilon sexually dimorphic traits, but also provide a potential method for the genetic control of this pest. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

positive,"Over expression of bmo-miR-2819 suppresses BmNPV replication by regulating the BmNPV ie-1 gene in Bombyx mori. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a major pathogen that threatens the growth and sustainability of the sericulture industry. Accumulating studies in recent years suggest that insect viruses infection can change the host microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profile and both cellular and viral miRNAs play roles in host-pathogen interactions. Until now, the functional analysis of miRNA encoded by silkworm for host-virus interaction is limited. In this study, we validate the down-regulation of bmo-miR-2819 upon BmNPV infection by qRT-PCR and confirm the BmNPV immediately early 1 gene, ie-1 is one of the targets for bmo-miR-2819 based on the results of dual luciferase report assay. Overexpression of bmo-miR-2819 can significantly decline the abundance of IE-1 protein level in BmNPV-infected silkworm larvae. Further, the expression level of polyhedrin gene and VP39 protein of BmNPV in the infected larvae after applying bmo-miR-2819 mimics was significantly decreased comparing with that of larvae with mimic control. Our results suggest that overexpression of bmo-miR-2819 could suppress BmNPV replication by down-regulating the expression of BmNPV ie-1 gene, which demonstrate that cellular miRNAs could affect virus infection by regulating the expression of virus genes. "
negative,"Complete genome sequences of two insect-specific flaviviruses. We determined the complete genomic sequences of two previously discovered insect-specific flaviviruses, Marisma mosquito virus (MMV) and Nanay virus (NANV), using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and Sanger sequencing. Complete polyprotein amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the closest known relatives of MMV and NANV are Donggang virus (89% identity, 95% similarity) and Nounané virus (53% identity, 70% similarity), respectively. Phylogenetic inference is in agreement with these findings. Potential programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting sites were bioinformatically identified in the genomes of both viruses. "
negative,"The 19 genomes of Drosophila: a BAC library resource for genus-wide and genome-scale comparative evolutionary research. The genus Drosophila has been the subject of intense comparative phylogenomics characterization to provide insights into genome evolution under diverse biological and ecological contexts and to functionally annotate the Drosophila melanogaster genome, a model system for animal and insect genetics. Recent sequencing of 11 additional Drosophila species from various divergence points of the genus is a first step in this direction. However, to fully reap the benefits of this resource, the Drosophila community is faced with two critical needs: i.e., the expansion of genomic resources from a much broader range of phylogenetic diversity and the development of additional resources to aid in finishing the existing draft genomes. To address these needs, we report the first synthesis of a comprehensive set of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) resources for 19 Drosophila species from all three subgenera. Ten libraries were derived from the exact source used to generate 10 of the 12 draft genomes, while the rest were generated from a strategically selected set of species on the basis of salient ecological and life history features and their phylogenetic positions. The majority of the new species have at least one sequenced reference genome for immediate comparative benefit. This 19-BAC library set was rigorously characterized and shown to have large insert sizes (125-168 kb), low nonrecombinant clone content (0.3-5.3%), and deep coverage (9.1-42.9×). Further, we demonstrated the utility of this BAC resource for generating physical maps of targeted loci, refining draft sequence assemblies and identifying potential genomic rearrangements across the phylogeny. "
negative,"Targeting symbiosis-related insect genes by RNAi in the pea aphid-Buchnera symbiosis. The growth and reproduction of phloem sap-feeding insects requires the sustained function of intracellular bacteria localized in specialized cells known as bacteriocytes, giving the potential to target the bacterial symbiosis as a novel strategy for controlling sap-feeding insect pests. We focused on two genes in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, amiD and ldcA1, which were acquired horizontally from bacteria and have the annotated function to degrade immunogenic bacterial peptidoglycan. We hypothesized that AmiD and LdcA1 function to eliminate peptidoglycan fragments released by the bacterial symbiont Buchnera inhabiting the bacteriocytes, thereby protecting the Buchnera from host attack. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of amiD and ldcA1 was enriched in bacteriocytes and varied significantly with aphid age, conforming to an inverse curvilinear relationship for amiD and negative linear relationship for ldcA1. RNAi against amiD and ldcA1 administered orally to larval pea aphids caused a significant reduction in Buchnera abundance and activity, accompanied by depressed aphid growth rates. For RNAi experiments, the aphids were co-administered with dsRNA against an aphid nuclease nuc1, protecting the dsRNA against non-specific degradation. These experiments demonstrate that selective suppression of insect symbiosis-related gene function can reduce the performance of an insect pest. Phylogenetic analysis identified amiD and ldcA1 in sequenced genomes of other aphid species, and amiD in related groups of phloem-feeding insects, offering the opportunity for specific controls against a range of insect pests. "
negative,"Constitutive activation of the midgut response to Bacillus thuringiensis in Bt-resistant Spodoptera exigua. Bacillus thuringiensis is the most effective microbial control agent for controlling numerous species from different insect orders. The main threat for the long term use of B. thuringiensis in pest control is the ability of insects to develop resistance. Thus, the identification of insect genes involved in conferring resistance is of paramount importance. A colony of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected for 15 years in the laboratory for resistance to Xentari™, a B. thuringiensis-based insecticide, reaching a final resistance level of greater than 1,000-fold. Around 600 midgut ESTs were analyzed by DNA-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. Among the differentially expressed genes, repat and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with B. thuringiensis resistance. We also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to Xentari™, suggesting a permanent activation of the response to Xentari™ in resistant insects. Increased aminopeptidase activity in the lumen of resistant insects in the absence of exposure to Xentari™ corroborated the hypothesis of permanent activation of response genes. Increase in midgut proliferation has been proposed as a mechanism of response to pathogens in the adult from several insect species. Analysis of S. exigua larvae revealed that midgut proliferation was neither increased in resistant insects nor induced by exposure of susceptible larvae to Xentari™, suggesting that mechanisms other than midgut proliferation are involved in the response to B. thuringiensis by S. exigua larvae. "
negative,"Genome-wide and expression-profiling analyses suggest the main cytochrome P450 genes related to pyrethroid resistance in the malaria vector, Anopheles sinensis (Diptera Culicidae). BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is one of the major malaria vectors. However, pyrethroid resistance in An. sinensis is threatening malaria control. Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification is an important pyrethroid resistance mechanism that has been unexplored in An. sinensis. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the An. sinensis P450 gene superfamily with special attention to their role in pyrethroid resistance using bioinformatics and molecular approaches. RESULTS: Our data revealed the presence of 112 individual P450 genes in An. sinensis, which were classified into four major clans (mitochondrial, CYP2, CYP3 and CYP4), 18 families and 50 subfamilies. Sixty-seven genes formed nine gene clusters, and genes within the same cluster and the same gene family had a similar gene structure. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of An. sinensis P450s (82 / 112) had very close 1: 1 orthology with Anopheles gambiae P450s. Five genes (AsCYP6Z2, AsCYP6P3v1, AsCYP6P3v2, AsCYP9J5 and AsCYP306A1) were significantly upregulated in three pyrethroid-resistant populations in both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses, suggesting that they could be the most important P450 genes involved in pyrethroid resistance in An. sinensis. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight on the diversity of An. sinensis P450 superfamily and basis for further elucidating pyrethroid resistance mechanism in this mosquito species. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"cDNA cloning, heat shock regulation and developmental expression of the hsp83 gene in the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. This report presents the cDNA cloning, heat shock regulation and developmental expression of the hsp90 gene homologue of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). The isolated cDNA contained the coding region, the 3'UTR and most of the 5'UTR of the medfly hsp90 homologue, which was named Cchsp83. The deduced CcHSP83 polypeptide contained all the highly conserved amino acid segments that characterize the cytosolic members of the HSP90 family. Genomic analysis showed that the Cchsp83 gene is unique and was mapped at the 94C division of the sixth polytene chromosome. The size of the Cchsp83 mRNA was found to be approximately 2.7 kb. The predicted molecular mass of the CcHSP83 protein was 81.4 kDa, while the apparent molecular weight estimated by SDS-PAGE was approximately 90 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis based on 14 insect HSP90 amino acid sequences was consistent with the known phylogeny at low taxonomic level. The Cchsp83 gene is constitutively expressed in all stages of medfly development and is induced from a low level to several-fold by heat, depending on the developmental stage. Heat shock induction begins at 30 degrees C, reaching a maximum between 35 and 41 degrees C. Cchsp83 RNA expression is highly regulated during embryonic development; however, the temporal fluctuations in RNA levels during embryogenesis were not followed by similar fluctuations in the levels of the protein.

negative,"InSatDb: a genomic tool for insect geneticists. Microsatellites show tremendous variation between genomes in terms of their occurrence and composition. Availability of whole genome sequences allows us to study microsatellite characteristics of fully sequenced insect genomes to understand the evolution and biological significance of microsatellites. InSatDb is an insect microsatellite database that provides an interactive interface to query information on microsatellites annotated with size (in base pairs and repeat units), genomic location (exon, intron, up-stream or transposon), nature (perfect or imperfect), and sequence composition (repeat motif and GC%). Here we present a snapshot of the distribution and composition of microsatellites in introns and exons of insect genomes. The data present interesting observations regarding the microsatellite life-cycle and genome flux. "
negative,"A new positive-strand RNA virus with unique genome characteristics from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. We report the discovery of a new virus with unique genome characteristics from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. This virus represents the second identified from this ant species. It is provisionally named Solenopsis invicta virus 2 (SINV-2). The SINV-2 genome was constructed by compiling sequences from successive 5' RACE reactions, a 3' RACE reaction, and expressed sequence tag, c246 (accession number EH413675), from a fire ant expression library. The SINV-2 genome structure was monopartite, polycistronic and RNA-based. The genome consensus sequence (EF428566) was 11,303 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail present on the 3' end. Analysis of the genome revealed 4 major open reading frames (ORFs; comprised of > or =100 codons) and 5 minor ORFs (comprised of 50-99 codons) in the sense orientation. No large ORFs were found in the inverse orientation suggesting that the SINV-2 genome was from a positive-strand RNA virus. Further evidence for this conclusion includes abolished RT-PCR amplification by RNase treatment of SINV-2 nucleic acid template, and failure to amplify without first conducting cDNA synthesis. Blastp analysis indicated that ORF 4 contained conserved domains of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease, characteristic of positive-strand RNA viruses. However, the protease domain and putative structural proteins (ORFs 1, 2, and 3) were less well conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp, helicase, and ORF 1 indicate unique placement of SINV-2 exclusive from the Dicistroviridae, iflaviruses, Picornaviridae, and plant small RNA viruses. "
negative,"Genome-wide survey for baculoviral host homologs using the Bombyx genome sequence. The Baculoviridae is a large family of pathogens that are infectious for arthropods, particularly insects of the Lepidoptera. Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), a genus of Baculoviridae, have a large circular, supercoiled, and double-stranded DNA genome packaged into rod-shaped virions. The Bombyx mori NPV (BmNPV), an NPV pathogenic for B. mori, is known to potentially encode 136 proteins. Using the B. mori genome information, we found that 15 of 136 BmNPV proteins (11%) show significant similarity to the B. mori proteins. Among them, genes encoding nine proteins can be deleted in B. mori cultured cell line BmN by homologous recombination, indicating that these genes are dispensable for normal virus production. Interestingly, most of non-essential auxiliary genes encode proteins controlling host physiology at cellular and / or organismal levels: ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase inactivates an insect molting hormone ecdysone, protein tyrosine phosphatase is involved in wandering behavior at the late stage of infection, fibroblast growth factor induces host cell chemotaxis, and chitinase and cathepsin are required for postmortem host liquefaction. Deletion analysis of other non-essential genes also showed that three of them are viral pathogenicity factors for B. mori. These findings suggest that the modern lepidopteran baculovirus may have acquired auxiliary genes from an ancestral host insect to control host physiology and to increase the efficiency of virus transmission in nature. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification of chitin-binding proteins and characterization of BmCBP1 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting. "
negative,"Anopheles gambiae genome reannotation through synthesis of ab initio and comparative gene prediction algorithms. BACKGROUND: Complete genome annotation is a necessary tool as Anopheles gambiae researchers probe the biology of this potent malaria vector. RESULTS: We reannotate the A. gambiae genome by synthesizing comparative and ab initio sets of predicted coding sequences (CDSs) into a single set using an exon-gene-union algorithm followed by an open-reading-frame-selection algorithm. The reannotation predicts 20,970 CDSs supported by at least two lines of evidence, and it lowers the proportion of CDSs lacking start and / or stop codons to only approximately 4%. The reannotated CDS set includes a set of 4,681 novel CDSs not represented in the Ensembl annotation but with EST support, and another set of 4,031 Ensembl-supported genes that undergo major structural and, therefore, probably functional changes in the reannotated set. The quality and accuracy of the reannotation was assessed by comparison with end sequences from 20,249 full-length cDNA clones, and evaluation of mass spectrometry peptide hit rates from an A. gambiae shotgun proteomic dataset confirms that the reannotated CDSs offer a high quality protein database for proteomics. We provide a functional proteomics annotation, ReAnoXcel, obtained by analysis of the new CDSs through the AnoXcel pipeline, which allows functional comparisons of the CDS sets within the same bioinformatic platform. CDS data are available for download. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive A. gambiae genome reannotation is achieved through a combination of comparative and ab initio gene prediction algorithms. "
negative,"A genomewide survey of homeobox genes and identification of novel structure of the Hox cluster in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Homeobox genes encode transcriptional factors that play crucial roles in a variety of developmental pathways from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes. We have identified 102 homeobox genes in the typical insect of Lepidoptera, Bombyx mori, based on the newly assembled genome sequence with 9X coverage. These identified homeobox genes were categorized into nine classes including at least 74 families. The available ESTs and microarray data at present confirmed that more than half of them were expressed during silkworm developmental processes. Orthologs of pb, zen and ftz were newly identified in the Bombyx Hox cluster on chromosome 6. Interestingly, a special group of 12 tandemly duplicated homeobox genes was found located between Bmpb and Bmzen in the Bombyx Hox cluster, suggesting that Hox cluster might have experienced a lineage-specific expansion in the silkworm. A detailed analysis on genome data reveals that a split exists between Bmlab and Bmpb. Our data provide valuable information for future research on the development and evolution of silkworm. "

"
negative,"Variation in genome size of argasid and ixodid ticks. The suborder Ixodida includes many tick species of medical and veterinary importance, but little is known about the genomic characteristics of these ticks. We report the first study to determine genome size in two species of Argasidae (soft ticks) and seven species of Ixodidae (hard ticks) using flow cytometry analysis of fluorescent stained nuclei. Our results indicate a large haploid genome size (1C>1000 Mbp) for all Ixodida with a mean of 1281 Mbp (1.31+ / -0.07 pg) for the Argasidae and 2671 Mbp (2.73+ / -0.04 pg) for the Ixodidae. The haploid genome size of Ixodes scapularis was determined to be 2262 Mbp. We observed inter- and intra-familial variation in genome size as well as variation between strains of the same species. We explore the implications of these results for tick genome evolution and tick genomics research. "
negative,"Application of Genomics for Understanding Plant Virus-Insect Vector Interactions and Insect Vector Control. The relationships between plant viruses and their vectors have evolved over the millennia, and yet, studies on viruses began <150 years ago and investigations into the virus and vector interactions even more recently. The advent of next generation sequencing, including rapid genome and transcriptome analysis, methods for evaluation of small RNAs, and the related disciplines of proteomics and metabolomics offer a significant shift in the ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in virus infection and transmission by insect vectors. Genomic technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to examine the response of insect vectors to the presence of ingested viruses through gene expression changes and altered biochemical pathways. This review focuses on the interactions between viruses and their whitefly or thrips vectors and on potential applications of genomics-driven control of the insect vectors. Recent studies have evaluated gene expression in vectors during feeding on plants infected with begomoviruses, criniviruses, and tospoviruses, which exhibit very different types of virus-vector interactions. These studies demonstrate the advantages of genomics and the potential complementary studies that rapidly advance our understanding of the biology of virus transmission by insect vectors and offer additional opportunities to design novel genetic strategies to manage insect vectors and the viruses they transmit. "
positive,"Evolution of the Torso activation cassette, a pathway required for terminal patterning and moulting. Embryonic terminal patterning and moulting are critical developmental processes in insects. In Drosophila and Tribolium both of these processes are regulated by the Torso-activation cassette (TAC). The TAC consists of a common receptor, Torso, ligands Trunk and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and the spatially restricted protein Torso-like, with combinations of these elements acting mechanistically to activate the receptor in different developmental contexts. In order to trace the evolutionary history of the TAC we determined the presence or absence of TAC components in the genomes of arthropods. Our analyses reveal that Torso, Trunk and PTTH are evolutionarily labile components of the TAC with multiple individual or combined losses occurring in the arthropod lineages leading to and within the insects. These losses are often correlated, with both ligands and receptor missing from the genome of the same species. We determine that the PTTH gene evolved in the common ancestor of Hemiptera and Holometabola, and is missing from the genomes of a number of species with experimentally demonstrated PTTH activity, implying another molecule may be involved in ecdysis in these species. In contrast, the torso-like gene is a common component of pancrustacean genomes. "
negative,"Transfers of mitochondrial DNA to the nuclear genome in the wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Many organisms carry nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs). We have identified 76 NUMTs in 25 genomic locations in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. The total amount of NUMTs in Nasonia is 42 972 bp exceeding over four-fold that found in Tribolium castaneum and almost fifty-fold that found in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Apis mellifera has an even larger number of NUMTs in its genome (over 230 kb). The Nasonia NUMTs were inserted by multiple independent events and frequently involved large fragments spanning multiple mitochondrial genes. Most of the NUMTs are recent transfers that occurred less than one million years ago after the speciation of N. vitripennis. Duplications and rearrangements in the nucleus have also occurred. Data suggest that NUMTs may be more common in hymenoptera than in other insect genomes. "
negative,"An expansion of the genome size dataset for the insect order Hymenoptera, with a first test of parasitism and eusociality as possible constraints. Although the Hymenoptera represent a remarkably diverse and socioeconomically important group that is of considerable interest in genome biology, they remain understudied in terms of genome size. This study reports new genome size estimates for 89 species of ants, bees and wasps, representing 17 families and four superfamilies. These are used in a test of the hypothesis that genome sizes are constrained by traits associated with parasitism or eusociality. Not all parasitoid wasps exhibit small genomes, though a relationship based on specific types of parasitism may still occur; by contrast, there was no convincing evidence of a constraint relating to eusociality. The data provided here can be used to guide future research aimed at understanding the evolution of large-scale genomic properties in this order. "
negative,"Lepidoptera genomes: current knowledge, gaps and future directions. Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the most ecologically diverse and speciose insect orders. With recent advances in genomics, new Lepidoptera genomes are regularly being sequenced, and many of them are playing principal roles in genomics studies, particularly in the fields of phylo-genomics and functional genomics. Thus far, assembled genomes are only available for <10 of the 43 Lepidoptera superfamilies. Nearly all are model species, found in the speciose clade Ditrysia. Community support for Lepidoptera genomics is growing with successful management and dissemination of data and analytical tools in centralized databases. With genomic studies quickly becoming integrated with ecological and evolutionary research, the Lepidoptera community will unquestionably benefit from new high-quality reference genomes that are more evenly distributed throughout the order. "
negative,"Sex loss in insects: causes of asexuality and consequences for genomes. Boasting a staggering diversity of reproductive strategies, insects provide attractive models for the comparative study of the causes and consequences of transitions to asexuality. We provide an overview of some contemporary studies of reproductive systems in insects and compile an initial database of asexual insect genome resources. Insect systems have already yielded some important insights into various mechanisms by which sex is lost, including genetic, endosymbiont-mediated, and hybridization. Studies of mutation and substitution after loss of sex provide the strongest empirical support for hypothesized effects of asexuality, whereas there is mixed evidence for ecological hypotheses such as increased parasite load and altered niche breadth in asexuals. Most hypotheses have been explored in a select few taxa (e.g. stick insects, aphids), such that much of the great taxonomic breadth of insects remain understudied. Given the variation in the proximate causes of asexuality in insects, we argue for expanding the taxonomic breadth of study systems. Despite some challenges for investigating sex in insects, the increasing cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing makes data generation for closely-related asexual and sexual lineages increasingly feasible. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of mutualistic viruses of Glyptapanteles parasitic wasps. BACKGROUND: Polydnaviruses, double-stranded DNA viruses with segmented genomes, have evolved as obligate endosymbionts of parasitoid wasps. Virus particles are replication deficient and produced by female wasps from proviral sequences integrated into the wasp genome. These particles are co-injected with eggs into caterpillar hosts, where viral gene expression facilitates parasitoid survival and, thereby, survival of proviral DNA. Here we characterize and compare the encapsidated viral genome sequences of bracoviruses in the family Polydnaviridae associated with Glyptapanteles gypsy moth parasitoids, along with near complete proviral sequences from which both viral genomes are derived. RESULTS: The encapsidated Glyptapanteles indiensis and Glyptapanteles flavicoxis bracoviral genomes, each composed of 29 different size segments, total approximately 517 and 594 kbp, respectively. They are generated from a minimum of seven distinct loci in the wasp genome. Annotation of these sequences revealed numerous novel features for polydnaviruses, including insect-like sugar transporter genes and transposable elements. Evolutionary analyses suggest that positive selection is widespread among bracoviral genes. CONCLUSIONS: The structure and organization of G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis bracovirus proviral segments as multiple loci containing one to many viral segments, flanked and separated by wasp gene-encoding DNA, is confirmed. Rapid evolution of bracovirus genes supports the hypothesis of bracovirus genes in an 'arms race' between bracovirus and caterpillar. Phylogenetic analyses of the bracoviral genes encoding sugar transporters provides the first robust evidence of a wasp origin for some polydnavirus genes. We hypothesize transposable elements, such as those described here, could facilitate transfer of genes between proviral segments and host DNA. "
negative,"Genomics at the evolving species boundary. Molecular studies on hybridization date back to Dobzhansky who compared chromosomal banding patterns to determine if interspecific gene flow occurred in nature [1]. Now, the advent of high-throughput sequencing provides increasingly fine insights into genomic differentiation between incipient taxa that are changing our view of adaptation and speciation and the links between the two. Empirical data from hybridizing taxa demonstrate highly heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation. Although underlining reasons for this heterogeneity are complex, studies of hybridizing taxa offers some of the best insights into the regions of the genome under divergent selection and the role these regions play in species boundaries. The challenge moving forward is to develop a better theoretical framework that fully leverages these powerful natural experiments. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of insect juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of insect juvenile hormone (JH) and its neuroendocrine control are attractive targets for chemical control of insect pests and vectors of disease. To facilitate the molecular study of JH biosynthesis, we analyzed ESTs from the glands producing JH, the corpora allata (CA) in the cockroach Diploptera punctata, an insect long used as a physiological model species and compared them with ESTs from the CA of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles albimanus. The predicted genes were analyzed according to their probable functions with the Gene Ontology classification, and compared to Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae genes. A large number of reciprocal matches in the cDNA libraries of cockroach and mosquito CA were found. These matches defined known and suspected enzymes of the JH biosynthetic pathway, but also several proteins associated with signal transduction that might play a role in the modulation of JH synthesis by neuropeptides. The identification in both cockroach and mosquito CA of homologs of the small ligand binding proteins from insects, Takeout / JH binding protein and retinol-binding protein highlights a hitherto unsuspected complexity of metabolite trafficking, perhaps JH precursor trafficking, in these endocrine glands. Furthermore, many reciprocal matches for genes of unknown function may provide a fertile ground for an in-depth study of allatal-specific cell physiology. ESTs are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers DV 017592-DV 018447 (Diploptera punctata); DR 746432-DV 747949 (Aedes aegypti); and DR 747950-DR 748310 (Anopheles albimanus). "
negative,"Genomic variations in the 3'-termini of Rice stripe virus in the rotation between vector insect and host plant. A large number of plant RNA viruses circulate between plants and insects. For RNA viruses, host alternations may impose a differential selective pressure on viral populations and induce variations in viral genomes. Here, we report the variations in the 3'-terminal regions of the multiple-segment RNA virus Rice stripe virus (RSV) that were discovered through de novo assembly of the genome using RNA sequencing data from infected host plants and vector insects. The newly assembled RSV genome contained 16- and 15-nt extensions at the 3'-termini of two genome segments compared with the published reference RSV genome. Our study demonstrated that these extensional sequences were consistently observed in two RSV isolates belonging to distinct genetic subtypes in RSV-infected rice, wheat and tobacco. Moreover, the de novo assembled genome of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus also contained 3'-terminal extensions in five RNA segments compared with the reference genome. Time course experiments confirmed that the 3'-terminal extensions of RSV were enriched in the vector insects, were gradually eliminated in the host plant and potentially affected viral replication. These findings indicate that variations in the 3'-termini of viral genomes may be different adaptive strategies for plant RNA viruses in insects and plants. "
negative,"Identification, genomic organization and expression profiles of four heat shock protein genes in the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, is an important invasive pest with a strong tolerance for extreme temperatures; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate thermotolerance in this insect remain unclear. In this study, four heat shock protein genes were cloned from F. occidentalis and named Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60. These four Hsps exhibited typical characteristics of heat shock proteins. Subcellular localization signals and phylogenetic analysis indicated that FoHsp90 and FoHsc701 localize to the cytosol, whereas FoHsc702 and FoHsp60 were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. Analysis of genomic sequences revealed the presence of introns in the four genes (three, four, seven, and five introns for Fohsp90, Fohsc701, Fohsc702 and Fohsp60, respectively). Both the number and position of introns in these four genes were quite different from analogous genes in other species. qRT-PCR indicated that the four Fohsps were detected in second-stage larvae, one-day-old pupae, and one-day-old adults, and mRNA expression levels were lowest in larvae and highest in pupae. Fohsc701 and Fohsc702 possessed similar expression patterns and were not induced by cold or heat stress. Expression of Fohsp60 was significantly elevated by heat, and Fohsp90 was rapidly up-regulated after exposure to both cold and heat stress. Exposure to -8°C had no effect on expression of the four Fohsps; however, expression of Fohsp90 and Fohsp60 was highest after a 2-h incubation at 39°C. Furthermore, cold and heat hardening led to significant up-regulation of the four Fohsps compared to their respective controls. Collectively, our results indicate that the four FoHsps contribute to insect development and also function in rapid cold or heat hardening; furthermore, FoHsp90 and FoHsp60 contribute to thermotolerance in F. occidentalis.  "
negative,"A dicistronic gene pair within a cluster of ""EF-hand"" protein genes in the genomes of Drosophila species. Androcam is a Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin-related protein that functions specifically in the testis. We show that the Acam gene is part of a cluster of three intronless genes arranged in a head-to-tail manner. The additional genes also encode calmodulin-related proteins with testis-specific transcription. Acam and the 5'-most gene (gene1) generate monocistronic transcripts. Surprisingly, the central gene (gene2) is transcribed only as a dicistronic transcript with Acam. A similar cluster is found in D. yakuba. In D. pseudoobscura, the cluster contains four genes: two Acam-type genes downstream of a single gene related to both gene1 and gene2 and a fourth weakly related gene. Nevertheless, the D. pseudoobscura cluster also generates a dicistronic transcript from a gene pair analogous to the gene2-Acam pair. A cotranscribed gene1 / 2-Acam gene pair may be the founding feature of this locus. Although Acam protein is present in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura testes, cognate proteins for the gene1 / 2-type ORFs are not detectable by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry techniques. "
positive,"Functional characterization of cis-acting elements mediating flavone-inducible expression of CYP321A1. How plant allelochemicals elicit herbivore counterdefense genes remains largely unknown. To define the cis-acting elements for flavone inducibility of the allelochemical-metabolizing CYP321A1 from Helicoverpa zea, functions of varying length of CYP321A1 promoter are examined in H. zea fatbody cells. Progressive 3' deletions reveal presence of positive elements in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Progressive 5' deletions map out regions of one essential element, four enhancers, and two silencers. Further progressive 5'deletions localize the essential element to a 36-bp region from -109 to -74. This essential element, designated as xenobiotic response element to flavone (XRE-Fla), contains a 5' AT-only TAAT inverted repeat, a GCT mirror repeat and a 3' antioxidant response element-like element. Internal deletions and substitution mutations show that the TAAT repeat is only necessary for the maximal flavone inducibility, whereas the other two components are necessary for the basal and flavone-induced expression of CYP321A1. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that XRE-Fla specifically binds to H. zea fatbody cell nuclear extracts and flavone treatment increases the nuclear concentrations of the yet-to-be characterized transcription factors binding to XRE-Fla. Taken together, CYP321A1 expression is regulated primarily by XRE-Fla and secondarily by other cis elements scattered in its promoter and 5' UTR. "
negative,"Metarhizium alvesii sp. nov.: A new member of the Metarhizium anisopliae species complex. A strain within the Metarhizium anisopliae species complex was isolated in 2009 from a soil sample in a banana plantation in the municipality of Quixeré, Northeastern region of Brazil. Previous studies showed that this insect-pathogenic strain does not fit with any current taxon within the M. anisopliae species complex, as determined by both genomic and by mass spectrometric analyses. In the present study, CG1123 (=ARSEF 13308) is shown to be morphologically indistinguishable from most species in this cosmopolitan species complex, whereas multilocus phylogeny confirmed its uniqueness and supports its recognition as a new species, Metarhizium alvesii, in honor of Sérgio Batista Alves, one of the founders of insect pathology in Brazil. "
negative,"Identification of glutathione S-transferases in Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and evidence that GSTd7 helps explain the difference in insecticide susceptibility between B. tabaci Middle East-Minor Asia 1 and Mediterranean. The Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera:Aleyrodidae) species complex includes invasive and destructive pests of field crops, and the sibling species MEAM1 and MED are its two most damaging members. Previous research indicated that the replacement of Middle East-Minor Asia 1 (MEAM1) by Mediterranean (MED) as the dominant B. tabaci species in China can be mainly attributed to MED's greater tolerance to insecticides. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play important roles in the detoxification of hydrophobic toxic compounds. To increase our understanding of differences in insecticide resistance between B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED, we searched the genomic and transcriptomic databases and identified 23 putative GSTs in both B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED. Through measuring mRNA levels of 18 of the GSTs after B. tabaci MEAM1 and MED adults were exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid, we found that the expression levels were increased more in B. tabaci MED than in MEAM1 (in particular, the expression level of GST-d7 was increased by 4.39-fold relative to the control). Knockdown of GST-d7 in B. tabaci MED but not in B. tabaci MEAM1 resulted in a substantial increase in the mortality of imidacloprid-treated adults. These results indicate that differences in GST-d7 may help explain why insecticide tolerance is greater in B. tabaci MED than in B. tabaci MEAM1. "
negative,"Characterization of the Complete Mitochondrial Genome of Harpalus sinicus and Its Implications for Phylogenetic Analyses. In this study, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of Harpalus sinicus (occasionally named as the Chinese ground beetle) which is the first mitochondrial genome for Harpalus. The mitogenome is 16,521 bp in length, comprising 37 genes, and a control region. The A + T content of the mitogenome is as high as 80.6%. A mitochondrial origins of light-strand replication (OL)-like region is found firstly in the insect mitogenome, which can form a stem-loop hairpin structure. Thirteen protein-coding genes (PCGs) share high homology, and all of them are under purifying selection. All tRNA genes (tRNAs) can be folded into the classic cloverleaf secondary structures except tRNA-Ser (GCU), which lacks a dihydrouridine (DHU) stem. The secondary structure of two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) is predicted based on previous insect models. Twelve types of tandem repeats and two stem-loop structures are detected in the control region, and two stem-loop structures may be involved in the initiation of replication and transcription. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses based on mitogenomes suggest that Harpalus is an independent lineage in Carabidae, and is closely related to four genera (Abax, Amara, Stomis, and Pterostichus). In general, this study provides meaningful genetic information for Harpalus sinicus and new insights into the phylogenetic relationships within the Carabidae. "
negative,"Complete Genome of Bacillus thuringiensis Myophage BigBertha. BigBertha is a myophage of Bacillus thuringiensis, a widely used biocontrol agent that is active against many insect pests of plants. Here, we present the complete annotated genome of BigBertha. The genome shares 85.9% sequence identity with Bacillus cereus phage B4.  "
negative,"Genome-wide transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of bollworm-infested developing cotton bolls revealed the genes and pathways involved in the insect pest defence mechanism. Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a major insect pest that feeds on cotton bolls causing extensive damage leading to crop and productivity loss. In spite of such a major impact, cotton plant response to bollworm infection is yet to be witnessed. In this context, we have studied the genome-wide response of cotton bolls infested with bollworm using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Further, we have validated this data using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. Comparative analyses have revealed that 39% of the transcriptome and 35% of the proteome were differentially regulated during bollworm infestation. Around 36% of significantly regulated transcripts and 45% of differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in signalling followed by redox regulation. Further analysis showed that defence-related stress hormones and their lipid precursors, transcription factors, signalling molecules, etc. were stimulated, whereas the growth-related counterparts were suppressed during bollworm infestation. Around 26% of the significantly up-regulated proteins were defence molecules, while >50% of the significantly down-regulated were related to photosynthesis and growth. Interestingly, the biosynthesis genes for synergistically regulated jasmonate, ethylene and suppressors of the antagonistic factor salicylate were found to be up-regulated, suggesting a choice among stress-responsive phytohormone regulation. Manual curation of the enzymes and TFs highlighted the components of retrograde signalling pathways. Our data suggest that a selective regulatory mechanism directs the reallocation of metabolic resources favouring defence over growth under bollworm infestation and these insights could be exploited to develop bollworm-resistant cotton varieties. "
positive,"The midgut V-ATPase subunit A gene is associated with toxicity to crystal 2Aa and crystal 1Ca-expressing transgenic rice in Chilo suppressalis. Insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are toxic to a diverse range of insects. Transgenic rice expressing Cry1A, Cry2A and Cry1C toxins have been developed that are lethal to Chilo suppressalis, a devastating insect pest of rice in China. Identifying the mechanisms underlying the interactions of Cry toxins with susceptible hosts will improve both our understanding of Cry protein toxicology and long-term efficacy of Bt crops. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that V-ATPase subunit A contributes to the action of Cry1Ab / 1Ac, Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxins in C. suppressalis. The full-length V-ATPase subunit A transcript was initially cloned from the C. suppressalis larval midgut and then used to generate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-producing bacteria. Toxicity assays using transgenic rice lines TT51 (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac fusion genes), T2A-1 (Cry2Aa), and T1C-19 (Cry1Ca) in conjunction with V-ATPase subunit A dsRNA-treated C. suppressalis larvae revealed significantly reduced larval susceptibility to T2A-1 and T1C-19 transgenic rice, but not to TT51 rice. These results suggest that the V-ATPase subunit A plays a crucial role in mediating Cry2Aa and Cry1Ca toxicity in C. suppressalis. These findings will have significant implications on the development of future resistance management tools. "
negative,"RNAi technology: a new platform for crop pest control. The insect pests are big threat in meeting the food demands for future generation. The present pest control strategies, including the existing transgenic approaches show certain limitations and are not completely successful in limiting the insect pests. However, the sequence-specific gene silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) holds a great promise for effective management of agricultural pests. RNAi is naturally occurring conserved process responsible for gene regulation and defense against pathogens. The efficacy of RNAi varies among different insect orders and also depends upon various factors, including the target gene selection, method of dsRNAs delivery, expression of dsRNAs and presence of off-target effects. RNAi-mediated silencing of different insect genes involved in various physiological processes was found to be detrimental to insects growth, development and survival. In this article, we have reviewed the potential of RNAi-based strategies for effective management of insect pests. We have also discussed the various parameters, which are to be considered for host-induced RNAi-mediated control of insect pests without producing any effect on non-target organisms and environment. "
negative,"Transcriptome Analysis and Screening for Potential Target Genes for RNAi-Mediated Pest Control of the Beet Armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner), is a serious pest worldwide that causes significant losses in crops. Unfortunately, genetic resources for the beet armyworm is extremely scarce. To improve these resources we sequenced the transcriptome of S. exigua representing all stages including eggs, 1(st) to 5(th) instar larvae, pupae, male and female adults using the Illumina Solexa platform. We assembled the transcriptome with Trinity that yielded 31,414 contigs. Of these contigs, 18,592 were annotated as protein coding genes by Blast searches against the NCBI nr database. It has been shown that knockdown of important insect genes by dsRNAs or siRNAs is a feasible mechanism to control insect pests. The first key step towards developing an efficient RNAi-mediated pest control technique is to find suitable target genes. To screen for effective target genes in the beet armyworm, we selected nine candidate genes. The sequences of these genes were amplified using the RACE strategy. Then, siRNAs were designed and chemically synthesized. We injected 2 µl siRNA (2 µg / µl) into the 4(th) instar larvae to knock down the respective target genes. The mRNA abundance of target genes decreased to different levels (∼20-94.3%) after injection of siRNAs. Knockdown of eight genes including chitinase7, PGCP, chitinase1, ATPase, tubulin1, arf2, tubulin2 and arf1 caused a significantly high level of mortality compared to the negative control (P<0.05). About 80% of the surviving insects in the siRNA-treated group of five genes (PGCP, chitinase1, tubulin1, tubulin2 and helicase) showed retarded development. In chitinase1-siRNA and chitinase7-siRNA administered groups, 12.5% survivors exhibited ""half-ecdysis"". In arf1-siRNA and arf2-siRNA groups, the body color of 15% became black 48 h after injections. In summary, the transcriptome could be a valuable genetic resource for identification of genes in S. exigua and this study provided putative targets for RNAi pest control. "
negative,"Mechanisms and dynamics of orphan gene emergence in insect genomes. Orphan genes are defined as genes that lack detectable similarity to genes in other species and therefore no clear signals of common descent (i.e., homology) can be inferred. Orphans are an enigmatic portion of the genome because their origin and function are mostly unknown and they typically make up 10% to 30% of all genes in a genome. Several case studies demonstrated that orphans can contribute to lineage-specific adaptation. Here, we study orphan genes by comparing 30 arthropod genomes, focusing in particular on seven recently sequenced ant genomes. This setup allows analyzing a major metazoan taxon and a comparison between social Hymenoptera (ants and bees) and nonsocial Diptera (flies and mosquitoes). First, we find that recently split lineages undergo accelerated genomic reorganization, including the rapid gain of many orphan genes. Second, between the two insect orders Hymenoptera and Diptera, orphan genes are more abundant and emerge more rapidly in Hymenoptera, in particular, in leaf-cutter ants. With respect to intragenomic localization, we find that ant orphan genes show little clustering, which suggests that orphan genes in ants are scattered uniformly over the genome and between nonorphan genes. Finally, our results indicate that the genetic mechanisms creating orphan genes-such as gene duplication, frame-shift fixation, creation of overlapping genes, horizontal gene transfer, and exaptation of transposable elements-act at different rates in insects, primates, and plants. In Formicidae, the majority of orphan genes has their origin in intergenic regions, pointing to a high rate of de novo gene formation or generalized gene loss, and support a recently proposed dynamic model of frequent gene birth and death. "
negative,"Development of bacterial artificial chromosome library resources for parasitoid Hymenoptera (Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti: Pteromalidae). The species of the genus Nasonia possess qualities that make them excellent candidates for genetic and genomic studies. To increase the wealth of genomic resources for the genus we constructed publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti. Libraries have 36 864 clones each, empty-vector contents of approximately 2% and average insert sizes of 113.1 and 97.7 Kb, respectively, representing 12 and 11 genome equivalents. The N. vitripennis library was used for genome sequence assembly and in efforts at positional cloning of a developmental gene. The genome assembly of N. vitripennis is currently composed on 6181 un-joined scaffolds. These BAC libraries can be used to identify and close regions between scaffolds of the genome assemblies of both species. "
negative,Amplification of complete insect mitochondrial genome in two easy pieces. The entire insect mitochondrial genome has been amplified in just two PCR reactions. 'Universal' insect primers and techniques to optimize amplification of long PCR products were used to obtain segments of the mitochondrial genomes of Helicoverpa zea and Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera) ranging in size from 3.7 kb to 14 kb or about 25% to over 85% of a typical 16 kb mtDNA. Overlapping pairs of fragments contain the complete mtDNA sequence. 
positive,"Anopheles stephensi Dox-A2 shares common ancestry with genes from distant groups of eukaryotes encoding a 26S proteasome subunit and is in a conserved gene cluster. The sequence of a cloned Anopheles stephensi gene showed 72% inferred amino acid identity with Drosophila melanogaster Dox-A2 and 93% with its putative ortholog in Anopheles gambiae. Dox-A2 is the reported but herein disputed structural locus for diphenol oxidase A2. Database searches identified Dox-A2 related gene sequences from 15 non-insect species from diverse groups. Phylogenetic trees based on alignments of inferred protein sequences, DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are orthologous. The only inconsistency was that the C-terminus appears to be more primitive in the yeasts than in plants. In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable. A plausible additional role, in which the 26S proteasome is implicated in regulation of phenol oxidase, would also apply to at least the mammalian genes. No function has yet been reported for the other included sequences. These were from genome projects and included Caenorhabiditus elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Fugu rubripes, and Toxoplasma gondii. A consensus of the results predicts a protein containing exceptionally long stretches of helix with a hydrophilic C-terminus. Phosphorylation site motifs were identified at two conserved positions. Possible SRY and GATA-1 binding motifs were found at conserved positions upstream of the mosquito genes. The location of A. stephensi Dox-A2 was determined by in situ hybridization at 34D on chromosome arm 3R. It is in a conserved gene cluster with respect to the other insects. However, the A. stephensi cluster contains a gene showing significant sequence identity to human and pigeon carnitine acetyltransferase genes, therefore showing divergence with the distal end of the D. melanogaster cluster. "
negative,"Estimation of the Whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genome Size Based on k-mer and Flow Cytometric Analyses. Whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) cryptic species complex are among the most important agricultural insect pests in the world. These phloem-feeding insects can colonize over 1000 species of plants worldwide and inflict severe economic losses to crops, mainly through the transmission of pathogenic viruses. Surprisingly, there is very little genomic information about whiteflies. As a starting point to genome sequencing, we report a new estimation of the genome size of the B. tabaci B biotype or Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) population. Using an isogenic whitefly colony with over 6500 haploid male individuals for genomic DNA, three paired-end genomic libraries with insert sizes of ~300 bp, 500 bp and 1 Kb were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. A total of ~50 billion base pairs of sequences were obtained from each library. K-mer analysis using these sequences revealed that the genome size of the whitefly was ~682.3 Mb. In addition, the flow cytometric analysis estimated the haploid genome size of the whitefly to be ~690 Mb. Considering the congruency between both estimation methods, we predict the haploid genome size of B. tabaci MEAM1 to be ~680-690 Mb. Our data provide a baseline for ongoing efforts to assemble and annotate the B. tabaci genome.  "
positive,"RNA interference of timeless gene does not disrupt circadian locomotor rhythms in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Molecular studies revealed that autoregulatory negative feedback loops consisting of so-called ""clock genes"" constitute the circadian clock in Drosophila. However, this hypothesis is not fully supported in other insects and is thus to be examined. In the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we have previously shown that period (per) plays an essential role in the rhythm generation. In the present study, we cloned cDNA of the clock gene timeless (tim) and investigated its role in the cricket circadian oscillatory mechanism using RNA interference. Molecular structure of the cricket tim has rather high similarity to those of other insect species. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that tim mRNA showed rhythmic expression in both LD and DD similar to that of per, peaking during the (subjective) night. When injected with tim double-stranded RNA (dstim), tim mRNA levels were significantly reduced and its circadian expression rhythm was eliminated. After the dstim treatment, however, adult crickets showed a clear locomotor rhythm in DD, with a free-running period significantly shorter than that of control crickets injected with Discosoma sp. Red2 (DsRed2) dsRNA. These results suggest that in the cricket, tim plays some role in fine-tuning of the free-running period but may not be essential for oscillation of the circadian clock. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of transcriptomic divergence between laboratory colony and field Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes of the M and S molecular forms. Our knowledge of Anopheles gambiae molecular biology has mainly been based on studies using inbred laboratory strains. Differences in the environmental exposure of these and natural field mosquitoes have inevitably led to physiological divergences. We have used global transcript abundance analyses to probe into this divergence, and identified transcript abundance patterns of genes that provide insight on specific adaptations of caged and field mosquitoes. We also compared the gene transcript abundance profiles of field mosquitoes belonging to the two morphologically indistinguishable but reproductively isolated sympatric molecular forms, M and S, from two different locations in the Yaoundé area of Cameroon. This analysis suggested that environmental exposure has a greater influence on the transcriptome than does the mosquito's molecular form-specific genetic background. "
negative,"Molecular Characterization of the 2016 New World Screwworm (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Outbreak in the Florida Keys. New World screwworm (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel 1858) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), is a myiasis-causing fly that can be a serious threat to the health of livestock, wildlife, and humans. Its progressive eradication from the southern United States, Mexico, and Central America from the 1950s to 2000s is an excellent example of successful pest management using sterile insect technique (SIT). In late 2016, autochthonous NWS were detected in the Florida Keys, representing this species' first invasion in the United States in >30 yr. Rapid use of quarantine and SIT was successful in eliminating the infestation by early 2017; however, the geographic source of this infestation remains unknown. Here, we use amplicon sequencing to generate mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data representing all confirmed cases of NWS from this infestation, and compare these sequences to preexisting data sets sampling the native distribution of NWS. We ask two questions regarding the FL Keys outbreak. First, is this infestation the result of a single invasion from one source, or multiple invasions from different sources? And second, what is the geographic origin of this invasion? We found virtually no sequence variation between specimens collected from the FL Keys outbreak, which is consistent with a single source of introduction. However, we also found very little geographic resolution in any of the data sets, which precludes identification of the source of this outbreak. Our lack of success in answering our second question speaks to the need for finer-scale genetic or genomic assessments of NWS population structure, which would facilitate source determination of potential future outbreaks.

positive,"Targeting the potassium ion channel genes SK and SH as a novel approach for control of insect pests: efficacy and biosafety. BACKGROUND: Potassium ion channels play a critical role in the generation of electrical signals and thus provide potential targets for control of insect pests by RNA interference. RESULTS: Genes encoding the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) and the voltage-gated potassium channel (SH) were knocked down in Tribolium castaneum by injection and oral delivery of dsRNA (dsTcSK and dsTcSH, respectively). Irrespective of the delivery mechanism a dose-dependent effect was observed for knockdown (KD) of gene expression and insect mortality for both genes. Larvae fed a 400 ng dsRNA mg-1 diet showed significant gene (P < 0.05) knockdown (98% and 83%) for SK and SH, respectively, with corresponding mortalities of 100% and 98% after 7 days. When injected (248.4 ng larva-1 ), gene KD was 99% and 98% for SK and SH, causing 100% and 73.4% mortality, respectively. All developmental stages tested (larvae, early- and late-stage pupae and adults) showed an RNAi-sensitive response for both genes. LC50 values were lower for SK than SH, irrespective of delivery method, demonstrating that the knockdown of SK had a greater effect on larval mortality. Biosafety studies using adult honeybee Apis mellifera showed that there were no significant differences either in expression levels or mortality of honeybees orally dosed with dsTcSK and dsTcSH compared to control-fed bees. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the titre of deformed wing virus, used as a measure of immune suppression, between experimental and control bees. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of using RNAi targeting neural receptors as a technology for the control of T. castaneum. © 2019 The Authors.

negative,"Characterization of burdock mottle virus, a novel member of the genus Benyvirus, and the identification of benyvirus-related sequences in the plant and insect genomes. The complete nucleotide sequence of the burdock mottle virus (BdMoV) isolated from an edible burdock plant (Arctium lappa) in Japan has been determined. BdMoV has a bipartite genome, whose organization is similar to RNA1 and RNA2 of benyviruses, beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), beet soil-borne mosaic virus (BSBMV), and rice stripe necrosis virus (RSNV). BdMoV RNA1 (7038 nt) contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 249-kDa polypeptide that consists of methyl-transferase, helicase, papain-like protease, AlkB-like, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains. The AlkB-like domain sequence is not present in the proteins encoded by other known benyviruses, but is found in replication-associated proteins of viruses mainly belonging to the families Alfaflexiviridae and Betaflexiviridae. BdMoV RNA2 (4315 nt) contains six ORFs that are similar to those of benyviruses: these are coat protein (CP), CP readthrough, triple gene block movement and cysteine-rich proteins. Phylogenetic analyses showed that BdMoV is more closely related to BNYVV and BSBMV than to RSNV. Database searches showed that benyvirus replicase-related sequences are present in the chromosomes of a chickpea plant (Cicer arietinum) and a blood-sucking insect (Rhodnius prolixus). Some other benyvirus-related sequences are found in the transcriptome shotgun libraries of a few species of plants and a bark beetle. Our results show that BdMoV is a distinct species of the genus Benyvirus and that ancestral and extant benyviruses may have infected or currently infect a wide range of hosts, including plants and insects. "
negative,"Fungal proteomics: from identification to function. Some fungi cause disease in humans and plants, while others have demonstrable potential for the control of insect pests. In addition, fungi are also a rich reservoir of therapeutic metabolites and industrially useful enzymes. Detailed analysis of fungal biochemistry is now enabled by multiple technologies including protein mass spectrometry, genome and transcriptome sequencing and advances in bioinformatics. Yet, the assignment of function to fungal proteins, encoded either by in silico annotated, or unannotated genes, remains problematic. The purpose of this review is to describe the strategies used by many researchers to reveal protein function in fungi, and more importantly, to consolidate the nomenclature of 'unknown function protein' as opposed to 'hypothetical protein' - once any protein has been identified by protein mass spectrometry. A combination of approaches including comparative proteomics, pathogen-induced protein expression and immunoproteomics are outlined, which, when used in combination with a variety of other techniques (e.g. functional genomics, microarray analysis, immunochemical and infection model systems), appear to yield comprehensive and definitive information on protein function in fungi. The relative advantages of proteomic, as opposed to transcriptomic-only, analyses are also described. In the future, combined high-throughput, quantitative proteomics, allied to transcriptomic sequencing, are set to reveal much about protein function in fungi. "
positive,"Expression and characterization of a recombinant i-type lysozyme from the harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis. Lysozymes are enzymes that destroy bacterial cell walls by hydrolysing the polysaccharide component of peptidoglycan. In insects, there are two classes of lysozymes, the c-type with muramidase activity and the i-type whose prototypical members from annelids and molluscs possess both muramidase and isopeptidase activities. Many insect genes encoding c-type and i-type lysozymes have been identified during genome and transcriptome analyses, but only c-type lysozymes have been functionally characterized at the protein level. Here we produced one of five i-type lysozymes represented in the immunity-related transcriptome of the invasive harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis as recombinant protein. This was the only one containing the serine and histidine residues that are thought to be required for isopeptidase activity. This i-type lysozyme was recombinantly expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, but the purified protein was inactive in both muramidase and isopeptidase assays. Transcription and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that this i-type lysozyme is produced in the fat body but is not inducible by immune challenge. These data suggest that i-type lysozymes in insects may have acquired novel and as yet undetermined functions in the course of evolution. "
negative,"Evolutionary genetics in insect phenotypic radiations: the value of a comparative genomic approach. Expanding genome sequencing and transgenic technologies are enabling the discovery of genes driving phenotypic diversity across insect taxa. Limitations in downstream functional genetic approaches, however, have been an obstacle for developing non-model systems for evolutionary genetics. Phenotypically diverse radiations, such as those exhibiting convergence and divergence as a result of mimicry, are ideal for evolutionary genetics as they can lead to insights using comparative genomic approaches alone. The varied and repeated instances of phenotypes in highly polymorphic systems allow assessment of whether similar loci are repeatedly targeted by selection and can inform how alleles sort across lineages. Comparative genomics of these taxa can be used to decipher components of gene regulatory networks, dissect regulatory regions, and validate genes. "
negative,"Identification of a tubulin-α gene specifically expressed in testis and adductor muscle during stable reference gene selection in the hermaphrodite gonad of the lion's paw scallop Nodipecten subnodosus. For non-model species, as many used for aquaculture, with minimal or no genomic information, relative quantification of gene expression studies requires preliminary research including the isolation of potential reference genes and the identification of those stably expressed under the biological conditions of interest. Here we report on the isolation of five partial gene sequences from gonad tissue cDNA in the functional hermaphrodite scallop Nodipecten subnodosus to be evaluated as reference genes: 18S-rRNA, riboprotein l8 (rp-l8), actin-β (act-β), elongation factor 1α (ef-1α) and alpha-tubulin-α (tub-α). We found that 18S-rRNA was stably expressed independently of the priming method used to reverse transcribe RNA to cDNA, oligo-dT or random hexamer. Stability analysis for the five putative reference genes with geNorm and NormFinder indicated that 18S together with rp-l8 were the most stable genes for normalization of gene expression during gonad development in both, male and female sexual regions of the hermaphrodite N. subnodosus. The least stable gene was tub-α, showing a biased expression profile between sexual regions of the gonad, therefore this gene was analyzed thereafter as a target gene together with vitellogenin (vit) and a DEAD-box RNA helicase (dbx) gene. Relative expression, estimated by normalization with the combination of 18S and rp-l8 as reference genes, indicated that as gonad development advanced two of the target genes were up-regulated, tub-α in the male region and vit in the female region. Whereas an increased expression was expected during development for vit for its known role in vitellogenesis, the increased expression of tub-α in the male sexual region was unexpected, and pointed toward this gene being a testis-specific α-tubulin isotype. Further analyses of gene expression among tissues indicated that tub-α is specifically and highly expressed in the male gonad, although expression in adductor muscle was also observed at significantly lower levels. The existence of testis specific α- and β-tubulins has been previously reported in other taxa, relating their function to sperm axoneme formation. Tissue-specific tubulin genes, particularly their promoters, have recently found an application as native promoters for transgene tissue-specific expression in research and reproductive control of insect plagues. The third target gene, a putative member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family (dbx), showed no changes in expression during gonad development or between sexual regions, therefore it was chosen to discuss the different statistical inferences resulting from the arbitrary use of 'randomly chosen' reference genes when normalizing gene expression. "
negative,"Genome analysis and genetic enhancement of tomato. The Solanaceae is an important family of vegetable crops, ornamentals and medicinal plants. Tomato has served as a model member of this family largely because of its enriched cytogenetic, genetic, as well as physical, maps. Mapping has helped in cloning several genes of importance such as Pto, responsible for resistance against bacterial speck disease, Mi-1.2 for resistance against nematodes, and fw2.2 QTL for fruit weight. A high-throughput genome-sequencing program has been initiated by an international consortium of 10 countries. Since heterochromatin has been found to be concentrated near centromeres, the consortium is focusing on sequencing only the gene-rich euchromatic region. Genomes of the members of Solanaceae show a significant degree of synteny, suggesting that the tomato genome sequence would help in the cloning of genes for important traits from other Solanaceae members as well. ESTs from a large number of cDNA libraries have been sequenced, and microarray chips, in conjunction with wide array of ripening mutants, have contributed immensely to the understanding of the fruit-ripening phenomenon. Work on the analysis of the tomato proteome has also been initiated. Transgenic tomato plants with improved abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance and insect resistance, have been developed. Attempts have also been made to develop tomato as a bioreactor for various pharmaceutical proteins. However, control of fruit quality and ripening remains an active and challenging area of research. Such efforts should pave the way to improve not only tomato, but also other solanaceous crops. "
negative,"A novel homeobox cluster expressed in repeated structures of the midgut. A gene cluster (LOX3-C) containing three duplicated homeobox sequences (Lox3A, Lox3B, and Lox3C) was characterized in the leech Hirudo medicinalis. The leech homeoboxes have a limited homology to those of Antennapedia-class genes, but do not have homologs among currently characterized insect genes. The Lox3 genes belong to a new family, named Xlox, that also includes genes from mouse, rat, frog, and a distantly related leech, Helobdella triserialis. All members of the Xlox family are expressed in specific regions of the embryonic gut, where they seem to affect morphogenesis and cell differentiation. The three homeoboxes of LOX3-C described here are contained within nearly identical direct tandem repeats. The LOX3-C region produces at least two transcripts, one present in both embryos and adults and the other only in early embryos. Early Lox3 expression is restricted to specific regions of the midgut primordium, in 12 segmentally repeated, transverse stripes of fusiform cells found at the positions where the midgut will constrict to form the 11 diverticula of the crop. A role in the development of segmentally iterated structures in an initially homogeneous midgut is proposed for LOX3-C. "
positive,"Heat shock proteins contribute to mosquito dehydration tolerance. This study examines the responses of heat shock protein transcripts, Hsp70 and Hsp90, to dehydration stress in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens. We first defined the water balance attributes of adult females of each species, monitored expression of the hsp transcripts in response to dehydration, and then knocked down expression of the transcripts using RNA interference (RNAi) to evaluate potential functions of the Hsps in maintenance of water balance. Fully hydrated females of all three species contained nearly the same amount of water (66-68%), but water loss rates differed among the species, with A. aegypti having the lowest water loss rate (2.6% / h), followed by C. pipiens (3.3% / h), and A. gambiae (5.1% / h). In all three species water could be replaced only by drinking water (or blood). Both A. aegypti and C. pipiens tolerated a loss of 36% of their body water, but A. gambiae was more vulnerable to water loss, tolerating a loss of only 29% of its body water. Dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in all three species, but only C. pipiens continued to express this transcript during rehydration. Hsp90 was constitutively expressed and expression levels remained fairly constant during dehydration and rehydration, except expression was not noted during rehydration of C. pipiens. Injection of dsRNA to knock down expression of hsp70 (83% reduction) and hsp90 (46% reduction) in A. aegypti did not alter water content or water loss rates, but the dehydration tolerance was lower. Instead of surviving a 36% water loss, females were able to survive only a 28% water loss in response to RNAi directed against hsp70 and a 26% water loss when RNAi was directed against hsp90. These results indicate a critical function for these Hsps in mosquito dehydration tolerance. "
negative,"Mining insect genomes for functionally affiliated genes. Several hundred insect genome assemblies are already publicly available, and this total grows on a weekly basis. A major challenge now confronting insect science is how best to use genomic data to improve our understanding of insect biology. We consider a framework for genome analysis based on functional affiliation, that is, groups of genes involved in the same biological process or pathway, and explore how such an approach furthers our understanding of several aspects of insect phenotype. We anticipate that this approach will prove useful for future research across the breadth of insect studies, whatever organism or trait it involves. "
negative,"The functions of caspase in whitefly Bemisia tabaci apoptosis in response to ultraviolet irradiation. Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) are phloem feeders, and some invasive species are composed of cryptic species complexes that cause extensive crop damage, particularly via the direct transmission of plant viruses. Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death essential for organismal development and tissue homeostasis. The caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases that play a central role in the initiation of apoptosis in many organisms. Here, we employed a comprehensive genomics approach to identity caspases in B. tabaci Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1), an invasive whitefly that carries a cryptic species complex that is devastating to crops. Four caspase genes were identified, and their motif compositions were predicted. Structures were relatively conserved in both putative effector and initiator caspases. Expression patterns of caspase genes differed across insect developmental stages. Three caspase genes were induced immediately after ultraviolet (UV) treatment. Expression levels of Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b increased in the midgut and salivary glands during apoptosis induced by UV treatments, whereas silencing of both genes reduced UV-triggered apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that Bt-caspase-1 and Bt-caspase-3b, respectively, act as putative initiator and effector apoptotic caspases in the MEAM1 whitefly. "
negative,"Open access genomic resources for terrestrial arthropods. Genome sequencing initiatives like the Arthropod i5k project and other biodiversity genomics research rely on access to high quality DNA and / or tissue. Global collection initiatives such as the Smithsonian Global Genome Initiative (GGI) and its partner network, the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) aim to provide access to these resources at high-quality standards. Here, we review progress toward providing genomic resources (tissues, DNA, genomes) for terrestrial arthropods, a megadiverse animal group, and compare progress in genome sequencing to all other animals. "
negative,"RNA Interference based Approach to Down Regulate Osmoregulators of Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci): Potential Technology for the Control of Whitefly. Over the past decade RNA interference (RNAi) technology has emerged as a successful tool not only for functional genomics, but in planta expression of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that could offer great potential for insect pest management. The diet of insects feeding exclusively on phloem sieves contains water and sugars as main components, and the uptake of the liquid food greatly depends on the osmotic pressure within the insect body. Based on this physiological mechanism, transgenic plants of Nicotiana tabacum were generated expressing double stranded RNA (dsRNA) against both aquaporin (AQP) and a sucrase gene, alpha glucosidase (AGLU). These two genes are involved in osmotic pressure maintenance particularly in sap sucking insects, and the aim was to disrupt osmoregulation within the insect ultimately leading to mortality. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to assess the suppression of gene expression in Bemisia tabaci (B. tabaci) and mortality was recorded during transgenic tobacco feeding bioassays. Feeding of insects on plants expressing dsRNA significantly reduced the transcript level of the target genes in B. tabaci after six days of feeding and more than 70% mortality was observed in B. tabaci fed on transgenic plants compared to the control plants. Our data shows that down-regulation of genes related to osmoregulation may find practical applications for the control of this important pest in cotton and other crops. "
negative,"Rescue of a plant cytorhabdovirus as versatile expression platforms for planthopper and cereal genomic studies. Plant viruses have been used as rapid and cost-effective expression vectors for heterologous protein expression in genomic studies. However, delivering large or multiple foreign proteins in monocots and insect pests is challenging. Here, we recovered a recombinant plant cytorhabdovirus, Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV), for use as a versatile expression platform in cereals and the small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus) insect vector. We engineered BYSMV vectors to provide versatile expression platforms for simultaneous expression of three foreign proteins in barley plants and SBPHs. Moreover, BYSMV vectors could express the c. 600-amino-acid β-glucuronidase (GUS) protein and a red fluorescent protein stably in systemically infected leaves and roots of cereals, including wheat, barley, foxtail millet, and maize plants. Moreover, we have demonstrated that BYSMV vectors can be used in barley to analyze biological functions of gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis genes. In a major technical advance, BYSMV vectors were developed for simultaneous delivery of CRISPR / Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNAs for genomic editing in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Taken together, our results provide considerable potential for rapid screening of functional proteins in cereals and planthoppers, and an efficient approach for developing other insect-transmitted negative-strand RNA viruses. "
negative,"Structure of the Bombyx sorbitol dehydrogenase gene: a possible alternative use of the promoter. In an initial effort to understand the molecular mechanism of how low temperature induces sorbitol dehydrogenase gene expression in diapause eggs of the silkworm, the sorbitol dehydrogenase gene was isolated from a Bombyx genomic library using a cDNA encoding the Bombyx homologue of mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase as a probe. The gene extended for about 10 kb, consisting of eight exons and seven introns. Four TATA motifs were found in the 5' upstream region of the gene, without CCAAT. AATTAA, instead of AATAAA, was localized in the upstream region of the polyadenylation site. Although a single copy of this gene was present per haploid genome, 1.2 kb and 1.1 kb transcripts were found from yolk cells in diapause eggs and from larval fat-body cells, respectively. The two major transcription initiation sites corresponding to both transcripts were localized at 355 and 226 base pairs upstream from the transition start site, indicating an alternative use of promoter. The 5'-upstream region of the gene contained a consensus sequence, TGA(A / T)AA(A / G / T), that has been found in insect genes expressed mainly in larval and pupal fat bodies. It also contained three kinds of sequences similar to cis-elements recognized by members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) / Drosophila Seven up (SVP), Drosophila hormone receptor 39 (DHR39) and Bombyx fushi tarazu transcriptional factor 1 (BmFTZ-F1). "
negative,"Functional annotation of the Ophiostoma novo-ulmi genome: insights into the phytopathogenicity of the fungal agent of Dutch elm disease. The ascomycete fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi is responsible for the pandemic of Dutch elm disease that has been ravaging Europe and North America for 50 years. We proceeded to annotate the genome of the O. novo-ulmi strain H327 that was sequenced in 2012. The 31.784-Mb nuclear genome (50.1% GC) is organized into 8 chromosomes containing a total of 8,640 protein-coding genes that we validated with RNA sequencing analysis. Approximately 53% of these genes have their closest match to Grosmannia clavigera kw1407, followed by 36% in other close Sordariomycetes, 5% in other Pezizomycotina, and surprisingly few (5%) orphans. A relatively small portion (∼3.4%) of the genome is occupied by repeat sequences; however, the mechanism of repeat-induced point mutation appears active in this genome. Approximately 76% of the proteins could be assigned functions using Gene Ontology analysis; we identified 311 carbohydrate-active enzymes, 48 cytochrome P450s, and 1,731 proteins potentially involved in pathogen-host interaction, along with 7 clusters of fungal secondary metabolites. Complementary mating-type locus sequencing, mating tests, and culturing in the presence of elm terpenes were conducted. Our analysis identified a specific genetic arsenal impacting the sexual and vegetative growth, phytopathogenicity, and signaling / plant-defense-degradation relationship between O. novo-ulmi and its elm host and insect vectors. "
negative,"Identification, genomic organization and expression pattern of glutathione S-transferase in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a multifunctional supergene family and some play an important role in insecticide resistance. We have identified 23 putative cytosolic GSTs by searching the new assembly of the Bombyx mori genome sequence. Phylogenetic analyses on the amino acid sequences reveal that 21 of the B. mori GSTs fall into six classes represented in other insects, the other two being unclassified. The majority of the silkworm GSTs belong to the Delta, Epsilon, and Omega classes. Most members of each class are tandemly arranged in the genome, except for the Epsilon GSTs. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) corresponding to 19 of the 23 GSTs were found in available databases. Furthermore RT-PCR experiments detected expression of all the GSTs in multiple tissues on day 3 of fifth instar larvae. Surprisingly, we found little or no expression of most Delta and Epsilon GSTs in the fat body, which is thought to be the main detoxification organ. This may explain the sensitivity of the silkworm to certain insecticides. Our data provide some insights into the evolution of the B. mori GST family and the functions of individual GST enzymes. "
positive,"Suppression of Gene Juvenile Hormone Diol Kinase Delays Pupation in Heortia vitessoides Moore. Juvenile hormone diol kinase (JHDK) is a critical enzyme involved in juvenile hormone degradation in insects. In this study, HvJHDK in the Heortia vitessoides Moore (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) transcriptional library was cloned. Stage-specific expression patterns of HvJHDK, HvJHEH, and HvJHE as well as juvenile hormone titers were determined. The three tested enzymes participated in juvenile hormone degradation. Moreover, juvenile hormone titers peaked after larval-larval molts, consistent with a role for juvenile hormone in inhibition of metamorphosis. HvJHDK was subsequently suppressed using RNA interference (RNAi) to reveal its functions. Different concentrations of dsJHDK elicited the optimal interference efficiency at different life stages of H. vitessoides. Suppression of HvJHDK decreased HvJHDK content and increased the juvenile hormone titer, thereby resulting in reduced triglyceride content, sharply declined survival rate, clearly lethal phenotypes, and extended larval growth. Moreover, suppression of HvJHDK upregulated HvJHEH and HvJHE expression levels, suggesting that there is feedback regulation in the juvenile hormone metabolic pathway. Taken together, our findings provide molecular references for the selection of novel insecticidal targets. "
positive,"Genome-Wide Screening and Functional Analysis Reveal That the Specific microRNA nlu-miR-173 Regulates Molting by Targeting Ftz-F1 in Nilaparvata lugens. Background: Molting is a crucial physiological behavior during arthropod growth. In the past few years, molting as well as chitin biosynthesis triggered by molting, is subject to regulation by miRNAs. However, how many miRNAs are involved in insect molting at the genome-wide level remains unknown. Results: We deeply sequenced four samples obtained from nymphs at the 2nd-3rd and 4th-5th instars, and then identified 61 miRNAs conserved in the Arthropoda and 326 putative novel miRNAs in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a fearful pest of rice. A total of 36 mature miRNAs with significant different expression levels at the genome scale during molting, including 19 conserved and 17 putative novel miRNAs were identified. After comparing the expression profiles, we found that most of the targets of 36 miRNAs showing significantly differential expression were involved in energy and hormone pathways. One of the 17 putative novel miRNAs, nlu-miR-173 was chosen for functional study. nlu-miR-173 acts in 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling through its direct target, N. lugens Ftz-F1(NlFtz-F1), a transcription factor. Furthermore, we found that the transcription of nlu-miR-173 was promoted by Broad-Complex (BR-C), suggesting that its involvement in the 20-hydroxyecdysone pathway contributes to proper molting function. Conclusion: We provided a comprehensive resource of miRNAs associated with insect molting and identified a novel miRNA as a potential target for pest control. "
negative,"A genome-wide analysis of courting and mating responses in Drosophila melanogaster females. In Drosophila melanogaster, seminal fluid proteins influence several components of female physiology and behavior, including re-mating rates, ovulation and oviposition, and sperm use. It is well-known that female flies are not simply passive vessels and that female-mediated interactions with male products are important to female (and thus male) reproductive success. While the population genetics, molecular evolution and physiological effects of seminal fluid proteins have been examined, the genetics and evolution of the female side of these post-mating interactions is unexplored in spite of work showing that female genotype and female-by-male genotype interactions are important determinants of sperm competition outcomes. Here we use microarrays to identify candidate genes involved in the female side of post-mating sexual interactions. We report the results of a whole-genome oligonucleotide chip experiment that reveals 23 genes differentially expressed between virgin females exposed and unexposed to courting males, and 38 genes differentially expressed between virgin and recently mated females. Immune related genes are overrepresented among the mating-influenced candidates. We use quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR to independently assess gene expression changes for roughly half of the mating-affected candidate genes. "
positive,"Overexpression of Gloverin2 in the Bombyx mori silk gland enhances cocoon / silk antimicrobial activity. The Bombyx mori cocoon / silk possesses many immune-related components, including protease inhibitors, seroins, and antimicrobial peptides, which likely help to protect the pupating larva from infection. However, the natural antimicrobial activity of the B. mori cocoon / silk is still too weak for biomedical applications. With the goal of enhancing this natural activity, we constructed a transgenic vector to overexpress the B. mori antimicrobial peptide Gloverin2 (BmGlv2) under control of the silk gland-specific Serion1 promoter. Transgenic silkworms were generated via embryo microinjection. A low level of BmGlv2 was expressed in the non-transgenic silk gland, but BmGlv2 was efficiently overexpressed and proteolytically activated in the transgenic line. Overexpressed BmGlv2 was secreted and incorporated into the silk during spanning without affecting cocoon / silk formation. Moreover, the transgenic cocoon / silk had significantly greater inhibitory activity against bacteria and fungi than the non-transgenic cocoon / silk. This strategy could help enhance the antimicrobial performance and biomedical application of silk. "
positive,"Identification of the chitinase genes from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Chitinases have an indispensable function in chitin metabolism and are well characterized in numerous insect species. Although the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella, which has a high reproductive potential, short generation time, and characteristic adaptation to adverse environments, has become one of the most serious pests of cruciferous plants worldwide, the information on the chitinases of the moth is presently limited. In the present study, using degenerated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR strategies, four chitinase genes of P. xylostella were cloned, and an exhaustive search was conducted for chitinase-like sequences from the P. xylostella genome and transcriptomic database. Based on the domain analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences and the phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domain sequences, we identified 15 chitinase genes from P. xylostella. Two of the gut-specific chitinases did not cluster with any of the known phylogenetic groups of chitinases and might be in a new group of the chitinase family. Moreover, in our study, group VIII chitinase was not identified. The structures, classifications and expression patterns of the chitinases of P. xylostella were further delineated, and with this information, further investigations on the functions of chitinase genes in DBM could be facilitated. "
negative,"Draft Genome of Busseola fusca, the Maize Stalk Borer, a Major Crop Pest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca, is an important Lepidopteran pest of cereal crops in Central, East, and Southern Africa. Crop losses due to B. fusca feeding activity vary by region, but can result in total crop loss in areas with high levels of infestation. Genomic resources provide critical insight into the biology of pest species and can allow for the development of effective management tools and strategies to mitigate their impact on agriculture. To this end, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome of B. fusca. The total assembled genome size was 492.9 Mb with 19,417 annotated protein-coding genes. Using a comparative approach, we identified a putative expansion in the Chorion gene family, which is involved in the formation of the egg shell structure. Our analysis revealed high repeat content within the B. fusca genome, with LTR sequences comprising the majority of the repetitive sequence. We hope genomic resources will provide a foundation for future work aimed at developing an integrated pest management strategy to reduce B. fusca's impact on food security. "
negative,"Fine mapping of the soybean aphid-resistance genes Rag6 and Rag3c from Glycine soja 85-32. KEY MESSAGE: Rag6 and Rag3c were delimited to a 49-kb interval on chromosome 8 and a 150-kb interval on chromosome 16, respectively. Structural variants in the exons of candidate genes were identified. The soybean aphid, an invasive species, has significantly threatened soybean production in North America since 2000. Host-plant resistance is known as an ideal management strategy for aphids. Two novel aphid-resistance loci, Rag6 and Rag3c, from Glycine soja 85-32, were previously detected in a 10.5-cM interval on chromosome 8 and a 7.5-cM interval on chromosome 16, respectively. Defining the exact genomic position of these two genes is critical for improving the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection for aphid resistance and for identification of the functional genes. To pinpoint the locations of Rag6 and Rag3c, four populations segregating for Rag6 and Rag3c were used to fine map these two genes. The availability of the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K / 8K iSelect BeadChip, combined with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers discovered through the whole-genome re-sequencing of E12901, facilitated the fine mapping process. Rag6 was refined to a 49-kb interval on chromosome 8 with four candidate genes, including three clustered nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes and an amine oxidase encoding gene. Rag3c was refined to a 150-kb interval on chromosome 16 with 11 candidate genes, two of which are a LRR gene and a lipase gene. Moreover, by sequencing the whole-genome exome-capture of the resistant source (E12901), structural variants were identified in the exons of the candidate genes of Rag6 and Rag3c. The closely linked SNP markers and the candidate gene information presented in this study will be significant resources for integrating Rag6 and Rag3c into elite cultivars and for future functional genetics studies.

negative,"Putting the genome in insect phylogenomics. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide a substantial increase in the size of molecular phylogenetic datasets that can be obtained for studies of insect systematics. Several new genome reduction approaches are leveraging these technologies to generate large phylogenomic datasets: targeted amplicon sequencing, target capture, and transcriptome sequencing. Although cost effective, these approaches provide limited data for questions outside of phylogenetics. For many groups of insects, sequencing the entire genome at modest coverage is feasible. Using these genomic reads, an automated Target Restricted Assembly Method (aTRAM) can use the results of blast searches to assemble thousands of single copy ortholog genes across a group of interest. These locally assembled genes can then be compiled into very large phylogenomic datasets. These genomic libraries have the advantage in that they also contain reads from the mitochondrial genome and symbiont genomes, as well the entire insect genome, and can be leveraged for additional studies beyond phylogenetics. "
negative,"What can genetic association panels tell us about evolutionary processes in insects? If we are to fully comprehend the evolution of insect diversity at a genomic level we need to understand how natural selection can alter genetically encoded characters within populations. Genetic association panels have the potential to be standard bearers in this endeavour. They enable the mapping of phenotypes to genotypes at unprecedented resolution while simultaneously providing population genomic samples that can be interrogated for the tell-tale signs of selection. Analyses of these panels promise to elucidate the entanglement of gene ontologies, pathways, developmental processes and evolutionary constraints, and inform how these are shaped by adaptation. "
negative,"Comparative Genomics of Lactobacillus brevis Reveals a Significant Plasmidome Overlap of Brewery and Insect Isolates. Lactobacillus (L.) brevis represents a versatile, ubiquitistic species of lactic acid bacteria, occurring in various foods, as well as plants and intestinal tracts. The ability to deal with considerably differing environmental conditions in the respective ecological niches implies a genomic adaptation to the particular requirements to use it as a habitat beyond a transient state. Given the isolation source, 24 L. brevis genomes were analyzed via comparative genomics to get a broad view of the genomic complexity and ecological versatility of this species. This analysis showed L. brevis being a genetically diverse species possessing a remarkably large pan genome. As anticipated, it proved difficult to draw a correlation between chromosomal settings and isolation source. However, on plasmidome level, brewery- and insect-derived strains grouped into distinct clusters, referable to a noteworthy gene sharing between both groups. The brewery-specific plasmidome is characterized by several genes, which support a life in the harsh environment beer, but 40% of the brewery plasmidome were found in insect-derived strains as well. This suggests a close interaction between these habitats. Further analysis revealed the presence of a truncated horC cluster version in brewery- and insect-associated strains. This disproves horC, the major contributor to survival in beer, as brewery isolate specific. We conclude that L. brevis does not perform rigorous chromosomal changes to live in different habitats. Rather it appears that the species retains a certain genetic diversity in the plasmidome and meets the requirements of a particular ecological niche with the acquisition of appropriate plasmids. "
negative,"Transcriptome Analysis of the Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Integument. The insect integument, formed by the cuticle and the underlying epidermis, is essential for insect fitness, regulation of lipid biosynthesis and storage, insect growth and feeding, together with development progress. Its participation in insecticide resistance has also been outlined. Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is one of the major vectors of Chagas disease in South America; however, genomic data are scarce. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the nymph integument in order to identify which genes are expressed and their putative role. Using the 454 GS-FLX sequencing platform, we obtained approximately 144,620 reads from the integument tissue. These reads were assembled into 6,495 isotigs and 8,504 singletons. Based on BLAST similarity searches, about 8,000 transcripts were annotated with known genes, conserved domains, and / or Gene Ontology terms.The most abundant transcripts corresponded to transcription factors and nucleic acid metabolism, membrane receptors, cell signaling, and proteins related to cytoskeleton, transport, and cell energy processes, among others. More than 10% of the transcripts-encoded proteins putatively involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and related components (fatty acid synthases, elongases, desaturases, fatty alcohol reductases), structural integument proteins, and the insecticide detoxification system (among them, cytochrome P450s, esterases, and glutathione transferases). Real-time qPCR assays were used to investigate their putative participation in the resistance mechanism. This preliminary study is the first transcriptome analysis of a triatomine integument, and together with prior biochemical information, will help further understandthe role of the integument in a wide array of mechanisms. "
negative,"Characterization of pea aphid resistance in Medicago truncatula. To achieve a thorough understanding of plant-aphid interactions, it is necessary to investigate in detail both the plant and insect side of the interaction. The pea aphid (PA; Acyrthosiphon pisum) has been selected by an international consortium as the model species for genetics and genomics studies, and the model legume Medicago truncatula is a host of this aphid. In this study, we identified resistance to PA in a M. truncatula line, 'Jester', with well-characterized resistance to a closely related aphid, the bluegreen aphid (BGA; Acyrthosiphon kondoi). The biology of resistance to the two aphid species shared similarity, with resistance in both cases occurring at the level of the phloem, requiring an intact plant and involving a combination of antixenosis, antibiosis, and plant tolerance. In addition, PA resistance cosegregated in 'Jester' with a single dominant gene for BGA resistance. These results raised the possibility that both resistances may be mediated by the same mechanism. This was not supported by the results of gene induction studies, and resistance induced by BGA had no effect on PA feeding. Moreover, different genetic backgrounds containing a BGA resistance gene from the same resistance donor differ in resistance to PA. These results suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in resistance to these two aphid species. Resistance to PA and BGA in the same genetic background in M. truncatula makes this plant an attractive model for the study of both plant and aphid components of resistant and susceptible plant-aphid interactions. "
positive,"Knockdown of the aminopeptidase N genes decreases susceptibility of Chilo suppressalis larvae to Cry1Ab / Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticide is currently the most widely used bioinsecticide. Bt expressing cry genes are some of the most successful foreign-genome-inserting genes used in transgenic insect-resistant crop development. Cry toxins are resistant to lepidopteran pests, such as Chilo suppressalis, a major insect pest of rice worldwide. Since Cry toxins exert their activity by binding to specific receptors in the midgut of target insects, identification of functional Cry toxin receptors in the midgut of C. suppressalis larvae is crucial to evaluate potential resistance mechanisms and develop effective strategies for inhibiting insect resistance. In this study, we isolated two aminopeptidase N genes (APN6 and APN8) from C. suppressalis and determined that they were expressed in the foregut. APN6 was highly expressed at the fourth instar, and APN8 was highly expressed in adult and pupa. Knockdown of CsAPN6 and CsAPN8 by RNA interference resulted in significantly decreased susceptibility of larvae to Bt rice varieties TT51 (expressing cry1Ac / cry1Ab fusion genes) and T1C-19 (expressing cry1Ca), but not T2A-1 (expressing cry2Aa). These findings suggest that both APN6 and APN8 are involved in the toxicity of Cry1Ac / Cry1Ab and Cry1Ca toxins. "
negative,"Genome-wide gene expression in response to parasitoid attack in Drosophila. BACKGROUND: Parasitoids are insect parasites whose larvae develop in the bodies of other insects. The main immune defense against parasitoids is encapsulation of the foreign body by blood cells, which subsequently often melanize. The capsule sequesters and kills the parasite. The molecular processes involved are still poorly understood, especially compared with insect humoral immunity. RESULTS: We explored the transcriptional response to parasitoid attack in Drosophila larvae at nine time points following parasitism, hybridizing five biologic replicates per time point to whole-genome microarrays for both parasitized and control larvae. We found significantly different expression profiles for 159 probe sets (representing genes), and we classified them into 16 clusters based on patterns of co-expression. A series of functional annotations were nonrandomly associated with different clusters, including several involving immunity and related functions. We also identified nonrandom associations of transcription factor binding sites for three main regulators of innate immune responses (GATA / srp-like, NF-kappaB / Rel-like and Stat), as well as a novel putative binding site for an unknown transcription factor. The appearance or absence of candidate genes previously associated with insect immunity in our differentially expressed gene set was surveyed. CONCLUSION: Most genes that exhibited altered expression following parasitoid attack differed from those induced during antimicrobial immune responses, and had not previously been associated with defense. Applying bioinformatic techniques contributed toward a description of the encapsulation response as an integrated system, identifying putative regulators of co-expressed and functionally related genes. Genome-wide studies such as ours are a powerful first approach to investigating novel genes involved in invertebrate immunity. "
positive,"Chitin deacetylase 1 and 2 are indispensable for larval-pupal and pupal-adult molts in Heortia vitessoides (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Heortia vitessoides Moore is a notorious defoliator of Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg trees. Chitin deacetylases (CDAs) catalyze the N-deacetylation of chitin, which is a crucial process for chitin modification. Here, we identified and characterized HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 from H. vitessoides. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 possess typical domain structures of CDAs and belong to the Group I CDAs. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 were highly expressed before and after the larval-larval molt. In addition, both exhibited relatively high mRNA expression levels during the larval-pupal molt, the pupal stage, and the pupal-adult molt. HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were highest in the body wall and relatively high in the larval head. Significant increases in the HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 transcript expression levels were observed in the larvae upon exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone. RNA interference-mediated HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 silencing significantly inhibited HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 expression, with abnormal or nonviable phenotypes being observed. Post injection survival rates of the larvae injected with dsHvCDA1 and dsHvCDA2 were 66.7% and 46.7% (larval-pupal) during development and 23.0% and 6.7% (pupal-adult), respectively. These rates were significantly lower than those of the control group insects. Our results suggest that HvCDA1 and HvCDA2 play important roles in the larval-pupal and pupal-adult transitions and represent potential targets for the management of H. vitessoides. "
positive,"Evolutionary divergence of the paralogs Methoprene tolerant (Met) and germ cell expressed (gce) within the genus Drosophila. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling underpins both regulatory and developmental pathways in insects. However, the JH receptor is poorly understood. Methoprene tolerant (Met) and germ cell expressed (gce) have been implicated in JH signaling in Drosophila. We investigated the evolution of Met and gce across 12 Drosophila species and found that these paralogs are conserved across at least 63 million years of dipteran evolution. Distinct patterns of selection found using estimates of dN / dS ratios across Drosophila Met and gce coding sequences, along with their incongruent temporal expression profiles in embryonic Drosophila melanogaster, illustrate avenues through which these genes have diverged within the Diptera. Additionally, we demonstrate that the annotated gene CG15032 is the 5' terminus of gce. In mosquitoes and beetles, a single Met-like homolog displays structural similarity to both Met and gce, and the intron locations are conserved with those of gce. We found that Tribolium and mosquito Met orthologs are assembled from Met- and gce-specific domains in a modular fashion. Our results suggest that Drosophila Met and gce experienced divergent evolutionary pressures following the duplication of an ancestral gce-like gene found in less derived holometabolous insects. "
negative,"The whole genome sequence of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), reveals insights into the biology and adaptive evolution of a highly invasive pest species. BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is a major destructive insect pest due to its broad host range, which includes hundreds of fruits and vegetables. It exhibits a unique ability to invade and adapt to ecological niches throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, though medfly infestations have been prevented and controlled by the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of integrated pest management programs (IPMs). The genetic analysis and manipulation of medfly has been subject to intensive study in an effort to improve SIT efficacy and other aspects of IPM control. RESULTS: The 479 Mb medfly genome is sequenced from adult flies from lines inbred for 20 generations. A high-quality assembly is achieved having a contig N50 of 45.7 kb and scaffold N50 of 4.06 Mb. In-depth curation of more than 1800 messenger RNAs shows specific gene expansions that can be related to invasiveness and host adaptation, including gene families for chemoreception, toxin and insecticide metabolism, cuticle proteins, opsins, and aquaporins. We identify genes relevant to IPM control, including those required to improve SIT. CONCLUSIONS: The medfly genome sequence provides critical insights into the biology of one of the most serious and widespread agricultural pests. This knowledge should significantly advance the means of controlling the size and invasive potential of medfly populations. Its close relationship to Drosophila, and other insect species important to agriculture and human health, will further comparative functional and structural studies of insect genomes that should broaden our understanding of gene family evolution. "
negative,"Functional genomics and insect chemical ecology. High-throughput molecular techniques (i.e., genomics) are now beginning to make their way into chemical ecology research. Pioneering functional genomics studies have made significant contributions to our understanding of insect pheromone production, reception, behavior, and insect-plant interactions. Much of this research involves nonmodel organisms, including the honey bee, silkworm, and bark beetles, underscoring that researchers need not be restricted to traditional model organisms for high-throughput research. Furthermore, the technology can reveal physiological interactions that might otherwise be missed by more traditional molecular approaches. Functional genomics should become more widely used as researchers appreciate the wealth of information this potent approach can supply. This review concentrates on a summary of available technologies for functional genomics as they may be applied by chemical ecologists studying insects. Allied technologies (proteomics and metabolomics) are introduced briefly toward the end in the context of future applications. "
negative,"Use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to estimate the size of the house-fly Musca domestica genome. House-flies, Musca domestica, are carriers of more than 100 devastating diseases that have severe consequences for human and animal health. A key bottleneck to progress in controlling the devastating human diseases transmitted by house-flies is lack of knowledge of the basic molecular biology of this species. However, before sequencing of the house-fly genome can be seriously considered it is important to know the size of the genome. In this paper, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to calculate genome size of the house-fly in side-by-side experiments with Drosophila melanogaster (known genome size of 180 Mb). Our results indicate the size of the house-fly genome is 295 + / - 10 Mb and that of D. melanogaster is 184 Mb. Thus, the house-fly genome is only about 1.6-fold larger than the genome of D. melanogaster. This indicates that the size of the house-fly genome makes it an excellent candidate for whole genome sequencing and that quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is an accurate method for the estimation of the size of insect genomes. "
negative,"Sperm Cells of a Primitive Strepsipteran. The unusual life style of Strepsiptera has presented a long-standing puzzle in establishing its affinity to other insects. Although Strepsiptera share few structural similarities with other insect orders, all members of this order share a parasitic life style with members of two distinctive families in the Coleoptera-the order now considered the most closely related to Strepsiptera based on recent genomic evidence. Among the structural features of several strepsipteran families and other insect families that have been surveyed are the organization of testes and ultrastructure of sperm cells. For comparison with existing information on insect sperm structure, this manuscript presents a description of testes and sperm of a representative of the most primitive extant strepsipteran family Mengenillidae, Eoxenos laboulbenei. We compare sperm structure of E. laboulbenei from this family with that of the three other families of Strepsiptera in the other strepsipteran suborder Stylopidia that have been studied as well as with members of the beetle families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae that share similar life histories with Strepsiptera. Meloids, Rhipiphorids and Strepsipterans all begin larval life as active and viviparous first instar larvae. This study examines global features of these insects' sperm cells along with specific ultrastructural features of their organelles.  "
positive,"Identification of a sugar gustatory receptor and its effect on fecundity of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. In insects, the gustatory system plays a crucial role in multiple physiological behaviors, including feeding, toxin avoidance, courtship, mating and oviposition. Gustatory stimuli from the environment are recognized by gustatory receptors. To date, little is known about the function of gustatory receptors in agricultural pest insects. In this study, we cloned a sugar gustatory receptor gene, NlGr11, from the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a serious pest of rice in Asia; we then identified its ligands, namely, fructose, galactose and arabinose, by calcium imaging assay. After injection of NlGr11 double-stranded RNA, we found that the number of eggs laid by BPH decreased. Moreover, we found that NlGr11 inhibited the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT). These findings demonstrated that NlGr11 could accelerate the fecundity of BPH through AMPK- and AKT-mediated signaling pathways. This is the first report to indicate that a gustatory receptor modulates the fecundity of insects and that the receptor could be a potential target for pest control. "
positive,"Heteromeric co-assembly of two insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunits: influence on sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, are selective agonists of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and are used extensively in areas of crop protection and animal health to control a variety of insect pest species. Here, we describe studies performed with nAChR subunits Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 cloned from the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a major insect pest of rice crops in many parts of Asia. The influence of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits upon the functional properties of recombinant nAChRs has been examined by expression in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, the influence of a Nlalpha1 mutation (Y151S), which has been linked to neonicotinoid lab generated resistance in N. lugens, has been examined. As in previous studies of insect alpha subunits, functional expression has been achieved by co-expression with the mammalian beta2 subunit. This approach has revealed a significantly higher apparent affinity of imidacloprid for Nlalpha1 / beta2 than for Nlalpha2 / beta2 nAChRs. In addition, evidence has been obtained for the co-assembly of Nlalpha1 and Nlalpha2 subunits into 'triplet' nAChRs of subunit composition Nlalpha1 / Nlalpha2 / beta2. Evidence has also been obtained which demonstrates that the resistance-associated Y151S mutation has a significantly reduced effect on neonicotinoid agonist activity when Nlalpha1 is co-assembled with Nlalpha2 than when expressed as the sole alpha subunit in a heteromeric nAChR. These findings may be of importance in assessing the likely impact of the target-site mutations such as Y151S upon neonicotinoid insecticide resistance in insect field populations. "
negative,"Structural divergence among genomes of closely related baculoviruses and its implications for baculovirus evolution. Baculoviruses are members of a large, well-characterized family of dsDNA viruses that have been identified from insects of the orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera. Baculovirus genomes from different virus species generally exhibit a considerable degree of structural diversity. However, some sequenced baculovirus genomes from closely related viruses are structurally very similar and share overall nucleotide sequence identities in excess of 95%. This review focuses on the comparative analysis of partial and complete nucleotide sequences from two groups of closely related baculoviruses with broad host ranges: (a) group I multiple nucleopolyhedroviruses (MNPVs) from a cluster including Autographa californica (Ac)MNPV, Rachiplusia ou (Ro)MNPV, and Plutella xylostella (Plxy)MNPV; and (b) granuloviruses (GVs) from a cluster including Xestia c-nigrum (Xecn)GV and Helicoverpa armigera (Hear)GV. Even though the individual viruses in these clusters share high nucleotide sequence identities, a significant degree of genomic rearrangement (in the form of insertions, deletions, and homologous recombination resulting in allelic replacement) is evident from alignments of their genomes. These observations suggest an important role for recombination in the early evolution and biological characteristics of baculoviruses of these two groups. "
negative,"Building a platform for predicting functions of serine protease-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and other insects. Serine proteases (SPs) and serine protease homologs (SPHs) play essential roles in insect physiological processes including digestion, defense and development. Studies of insect genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes have generated a vast amount of information on these proteins, dwarfing the biological data acquired from a few model species. The large number and high diversity of homologous sequences makes it a challenge to use the limited functional information for making predictions across a broad taxonomic group of insects. In this work, we have extensively updated the framework of knowledge on the SP-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster by identifying 52 new SPs / SPHs, classifying the 257 proteins into four groups (CLIP, gut, single- and multi-domain SPs / SPHs), and detecting inherent connections among phylogenetic relationships, genomic locations and expression profiles for 99 of the genes. Information on the existence of specific proteins in eggs, larvae, pupae and adults is presented to facilitate future research. More importantly, we have developed an approach to reveal close homologous or orthologous relationships among SPs / SPHs from D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Manduca sexta, and Tribolium castaneum thus inspiring functional studies in these and other holometabolous insects. This approach is useful for tackling similar problems on large and diverse protein families in other groups of organisms. "
positive,"G119S ace-1 mutation conferring insecticide resistance detected in the Culex pipiens complex in Morocco. BACKGROUND: Arboviruses are controlled through insecticide control of their mosquito vector. However, inconsiderate use of insecticides often results in the selection of resistance in treated populations, so that monitoring is required to optimize their usage. Here, Culex pipiens (West Nile and Rift Valley Fever virus vector) specimens were collected from four Moroccan cities. Levels of susceptibility to the organophosphate (OP) insecticide malathion were assessed using World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended bioassays. Individual mosquitoes were tested for the presence of the G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene, the main OP-target resistance mutation. RESULTS: Bioassays showed that mosquitoes from Mohammedia were significantly more resistant to malathion than those from Marrakech. Analyzing the ace-1 genotypes in dead and surviving individuals suggested that other resistance mechanisms may be present in Mohammedia. The ace-1 resistance allele frequencies were relatively moderate (< 0.4). Their analyses in three Moroccan cities (Tangier, Casablanca and Marrakech) however showed disparities between two coexisting Cx. pipiens forms and revealed that the G119S mutation tends to be more frequent in urban than in rural collection sites. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a reference assessment of OP resistance in Morocco and should help the health authorities to develop informed and sustainable vector control programs. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"The Aedes aegypti larval transcriptome: a comparative perspective with emphasis on trypsins and the domain structure of peritrophins. The genome sequence of Aedes aegypti was recently reported. A significant amount of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were sequenced to aid in the gene prediction process. In the present work we describe an integrated analysis of the genomic and EST data, focusing on genes with preferential expression in larvae (LG), adults (AG) and in both stages (SG). A total of 913 genes (5.4% of the transcript complement) are LG, including ion transporters and cuticle proteins that are important for ion homeostasis and defense. From a starting set of 245 genes encoding the trypsin domain, we identified 66 putative LG, AG, and SG trypsins by manual curation. Phylogenetic analyses showed that AG trypsins are divergent from their larval counterparts (LG), grouping with blood-induced trypsins from Anopheles gambiae and Simulium vittatum. These results support the hypothesis that blood-feeding arose only once, in the ancestral Culicomorpha. Peritrophins are proteins that interlock chitin fibrils to form the peritrophic membrane (PM) that compartmentalizes the food in the midgut. These proteins are recognized by having chitin-binding domains with 6 conserved Cys and may also present mucin-like domains (regions expected to be highly O-glycosylated). PM may be formed by a ring of cells (type 2, seen in Ae. aegypti larvae and Drosophila melanogaster) or by most midgut cells (type 1, found in Ae. aegypti adult and Tribolium castaneum). LG and D. melanogaster peritrophins have more complex domain structures than AG and T. castaneum peritrophins. Furthermore, mucin-like domains of peritrophins from T. castaneum (feeding on rough food) are lengthier than those of adult Ae. aegypti (blood-feeding). This suggests, for the first time, that type 1 and type 2 PM may have variable molecular architectures determined by different peritrophins and / or ancillary proteins, which may be partly modulated by diet. "
positive,"All-trans retinoic acid affects subcellular localization of a novel BmNIF3l protein: functional deduce and tissue distribution of NIF3l gene from silkworm (Bombyx mori). A novel cDNA sequence encoding a predicted protein of 271 amino acids containing a conserved NIF3 domain was found from a pupal cDNA library of silkworm. The corresponding gene was named BmNIF3l (Bombyx mori NGG1p interacting factor 3-like). It was found by bioinformatics that BmNIF3l gene consisted of five exons and four introns and BmNIF3l had a high degree of homology to other NIF3-like proteins, especially in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. A His-tagged BmNIF3l fusion protein with a molecular weight of approximately 33.6 kDa was expressed and purified to homogeneity. We have used the purified fusion protein to produce polyclonal antibodies against BmNIF3l for histochemical analysis. Subcellular localization revealed that BmNIF3l is a cytoplasmic protein that responds to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression level of BmNIF3l is higher in tissues undergoing differentiation. Taken together, the results suggest that BmNIF3l functions in transcription. "
negative,"piggyBac internal sequences are necessary for efficient transformation of target genomes. A previously reported piggyBac minimal sequence cartridge, which is capable of efficient transposition in embryo interplasmid transposition assays, failed to produce transformants at a significant frequency in Drosophila melanogaster compared with full-length or less extensive internal deletion constructs. We have re-examined the importance of these internal domain (ID) sequences for germline transformation using a PCR strategy that effectively adds increasing lengths of ID sequences to each terminus. A series of these piggyBac ID synthetic deletion plasmids containing the 3xP3-ECFP marker gene are compared for germline transformation of D. melanogaster. Our analyses identify a minimal sequence configuration that is sufficient for movement of piggyBac vectored sequences from plasmids into the insect genome. Southern hybridizations confirm the presence of the piggyBac transposon sequences, and insertion site analyses confirm these integrations target TTAA sites. The results verify that ID sequences adjacent to the 5' and 3' terminal repeat domains are crucial for effective germline transformation with piggyBac even though they are not required for excision or interplasmid transposition. Using this information we reconstructed an inverted repeat cartridge, ITR1.1k, and a minimal piggyBac transposon vector, pXL-BacII-ECFP, each of which contains these identified ID sequences in addition to the terminal repeat configuration previously described as essential for mobility. We confirm in independent experiments that these new minimal constructs yield transformation frequencies similar to the control piggyBac vector. Sequencing analyses of our constructs verify the position and the source of a point mutation within the 3' internal repeat sequence of our vectors that has no apparent effect on transformation efficiency. "
negative,"Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Host-Plant Resistance to Soybean Aphid. Soybean aphid [ Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] is the most damaging insect pest of soybean [ (L.) Merr.] in the Upper Midwest of the United States and is primarily controlled by insecticides. Soybean aphid resistance (i.e., genes) has been documented in some soybean accessions but more sources of resistance are needed. Incorporation of the resistance into marketed varieties has also been slow. Genome-wide association mapping can aid in identifying resistant accessions by correlating phenotypic data with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a genome. Aphid population measures from 2366 soybean accessions were collected from published studies screening cultivated soybean () and wild soybean ( Siebold & Zucc.) with aphids exhibiting Biotype 1, 2, or 3 characteristics. Genotypic data were obtained from the SoySNP50K high-density genotyping array previously used to genotype the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. Significant associations between SNPs and soybean aphid counts were found on 18 of the 20 soybean chromosomes. Significant SNPs were found on chromosomes 7, 8, 13, and 16 with known genes. SNPs were also significant on chromosomes 1, 2, 4 to 6, 9 to 12, 14, and 17 to 20 where genes have not yet been mapped, suggesting that many genes remain to be discovered. These SNPs can be used to determine accessions that are likely to have novel aphid resistance traits of value for breeding programs. "
negative,"Comparative mitochondrial genome analysis of Spilarctia subcarnea and other noctuid insects. This study was performed to better understand the phylogenetic relationships within the lepidopteran superfamily Noctuoidea. The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has been extensively used for studying phylogenetic relationships at different taxonomic levels. In this study, the complete mitogenome of Spilarctia subcarnea (Noctuoidea: Erebidae) was sequenced and annotated. The mitogenome is 15,441bp in length, containing 13 typical protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and a noncoding control region (CR). The order and orientation of genes of S. subcarnea mitogenome with the order trnM-trnI-trnQ-nad2 is different from the ancestral insects in which trnM is located between trnQ and nad2 (trnI-trnQ-trnM-nad2). The phylogenetic relationships based on mitochondrial sequences using Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood methods showed that S. subcarnea was closely related to Lemyra melli, supporting that S. subcarnea belongs to Erebidae. These analyses confirm that Lymantriidae should be included as subfamilies within Erebidae. The Erebidae was sister to (Nolidae+(Euteliidae+Noctuidae)); Notodontidae is sister to the other families of Noctuoidea in our study. "
negative,"Detection and analysis of alternative splicing in the silkworm by aligning expressed sequence tags with the genomic sequence. We identified 277 alternative splice forms in silkworm genes based on aligning expressed sequence tags with genomic sequences, using a transcript assembly program. A large fraction (74%) of these alternative splices are located in protein-coding regions and alter protein products, whereas only 26% are in untranslated regions. From the alternative splices located in protein-coding regions, some (43%) affect protein domains that bind various biological molecules. The vast majority of the detected alternative forms in this study appear to be novel, and potentially affect biologically meaningful control of function in silkworm genes. Our results indicate that alternative splicing in silkworm largely produces protein diversity and functional diversity, and is a widely used mechanism for regulating gene expression. "
negative,"IPB7 transposase behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. Transposons are used in insect science as genetic tools that enable the transformation of insects and the identification and isolation of genes though their ability to insert in or near to them. Four transposons, piggyBac, Mos1, Hermes and Minos are commonly used in insects beyond Drosophila melanogaster with piggyBac, due to its wide host range and frequency of transposition, being the most commonly chosen. The utility of these transposons as genetic tools is directly proportional to their activity since higher transposition rates would be expected to lead to higher transformation frequencies and higher frequencies of insertion throughout the genome. As a consequence there is an ongoing need for hyperactive transposases for use in insect genetics, however these have proven difficult to obtain. IPB7 is a hyperactive mutant of the piggyBac transposase that was identified by a genetic screen performed in yeast, a mammalian codon optimized version of which was then found to be highly active in rodent embryonic stem cells with no apparent deleterious effects. Here we report the activity of IPB7 in D. melanogaster and the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Somatic transposition assays revealed an increase in IPB7's transposition rate from wild-type piggyBac transposase in D. melanogaster but not Ae. aegypti. However the use of IPB7 in D. melanogaster genetic transformations produced a high rate of sterility and a low transformation rate compared to wild-type transposase. This high rate of sterility was accompanied by significant gonadal atrophy that was also observed in the absence of the piggyBac vector transposon. We conclude that IPB7 has increased activity in the D. melanogaster germ-line but that a component of the sterility associated with its activity is independent of the presence of the piggyBac transposon.  "
negative,"The distinct properties of natural and GM cry insecticidal proteins. The Cry toxins are a family of crystal-forming proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Their mode of action is thought to be to create pores that disrupt the gut epithelial membranes of juvenile insects. These pores allow pathogen entry into the hemocoel, thereby killing the insect. Genes encoding a spectrum of Cry toxins, including Cry mutants, Cry chimaeras and other Cry derivatives, are used commercially to enhance insect resistance in genetically modified (GM) crops. In most countries of the world, such GM crops are regulated and must be assessed for human and environmental safety. However, such risk assessments often do not test the GM crop or its tissues directly. Instead, assessments rely primarily on historical information from naturally occurring Cry proteins and on data collected on Cry proteins (called 'surrogates') purified from laboratory strains of bacteria engineered to express Cry protein. However, neither surrogates nor naturally occurring Cry proteins are identical to the proteins to which humans or other nontarget organisms are exposed by the production and consumption of GM plants. To-date there has been no systematic survey of these differences. This review fills this knowledge gap with respect to the most commonly grown GM Cry-containing crops approved for international use. Having described the specific differences between natural, surrogate and GM Cry proteins this review assesses these differences for their potential to undermine the reliability of risk assessments. Lastly, we make specific recommendations for improving risk assessments. "
positive,"The regulation of crecropin-A and gloverin 2 by the silkworm Toll-like gene 18 wheeler in immune response. The innate immune system is conserved among different insect species in its response to microorganism infection. The transmembrane receptors of the Toll superfamily play an important role in activating immune response, however, the function of silkworm Toll family member 18 Wheeler (18 W) remained unclear. Here, the 18w gene in silkworm was characterized. A relatively high transcription level of Bm18w mRNA was found in Malpighian tubules, and in eggs, larvae pre-molt to fourth instar, pupae and adults. When silkworm larvae were infected with E. coli or S. aureus, Bm18w showed a significant response, especially to E. coli, but did not have antibacterial activity. To further identify the downstream antimicrobial peptide genes of Bm18w, expression of Bm18w was knocked down with siRNA in vitro, resulting in significant decreases of cecropin-A, gloverin 2, and moricin B3. The overexpression of Bm18w was carried out using pIZT / V5-His-mCherry insect vector in BmN cells and significant upregulation of cecropin-A and gloverin 2 was detected, as well as upregulation of attacin and defensin. Based on the results, we concluded that Bm18w is involved in response to bacterial infection by selectively inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, especially cecropin-A and gloverin 2. This study provides valuable data to supplement understanding of the immune pathway of the silkworm. "
positive,"Digestive beta-glucosidases from the wood-feeding higher termite, Nasutitermes takasagoensis: intestinal distribution, molecular characterization, and alteration in sites of expression. beta-Glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21] hydrolyzes cellobiose or cello-oligosaccharides into glucose during cellulose digestion in termites. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses of the digestive system in the higher termite Nasutitermes takasagoensis revealed that beta-glucosidase activity is localized in the salivary glands and midgut as dimeric glycoproteins. Degenerate PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the salivary beta-glucosidase resulted in cDNA fragments of 1.7 kb, encoding 489 amino acids with a sequence similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. Moreover, these primers amplified cDNA fragments from the midgut, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87-91% identical to those of the salivary beta-glucosidases. Successful expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli implies that these sequences also encode functional beta-glucosidases. These results indicate that beta-glucosidases that primarily contribute to the digestive process of N. takasagoensis are produced in the midgut. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated the site-specific expression of beta-glucosidase mRNAs in the salivary glands and midgut. These results suggest that termites have developed the ability to produce beta-glucosidases in the midgut, as is the case for endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, in which the site of expression has shifted from the salivary glands of lower termites to the midgut of higher termites. "
negative,"Biological and Genomic Sequence Characterization of Maize streak virus Isolates from Wheat. ABSTRACT Maize streak virus (MSV) is best known as the causal agent of maize streak disease. However, only a genetically uniform subset of the viruses within this diverse species is actually capable of producing severe symptoms in maize. Whereas these ""maize-type"" viruses all share greater than 95% sequence identity, MSV strains isolated from grasses may share as little as 79% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Here, we present the complete genome sequences and biological characterization of two MSV isolates from wheat that share approximately 89% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Clonal populations of these two isolates, named MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, were leafhopper-transmitted to Digitaria sanguinalis and a range of maize, wheat, and barley genotypes. Whereas the two viruses showed some differences in their pathogenicity in maize, they were both equally pathogenic in D. sanguinalis and the various wheat and barley genotypes tested. Phylogenetic analyses involving the genome sequences of MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, a new maize-type virus also fully sequenced in this study (MSV-VM), and all other available African streak virus sequences, indicated that MSV-Tas and MSV-VW are close relatives that together represent a distinct MSV strain. Sequence analyses revealed that MSV-VM has a recombinant genome containing MSV-Tas / VW-like sequences within its movement protein gene. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the bristletail Petrobius brevistylis (Archaeognatha: Machilidae). The complete mitochondrial genome of the bristletail Petrobius brevistylis has been determined. The genome is 15,698 bp long and bears the standard set of genes common to all arthropods as well as a major non-coding A+T-rich region, the putative mitochondrial control region. A unique gene order was revealed as it differs from other hexapod and crustacean mitochondrial genomes in the position of tRNA-Tyr. Genome features like nucleotide composition and codon usage are compared with that of other insect taxa. A+T content is similar in species of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, but obviously lower than in Collembola and Pterygota. This A+T bias significantly affects also amino acid frequencies and may be a problem for phylogenetic analyses. "
negative,"BgFas1: A fatty acid synthase gene required for both hydrocarbon and cuticular fatty acid biosynthesis in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the evolutionary products of aquatic hexapod ancestors expanding to terrestrial environment, are deposited on the surface of insect integument and originally functioned primarily as waterproofing agents. CHCs are derived from the conserved fatty acid synthesis pathway in insects. However, the pivotal fatty acid synthase (FAS) involved in hydrocarbon (HC) biosynthesis remains unknown in many insect orders including the primitive Blattodea. Here, we investigated functional FAS genes that modulate cuticular lipid biogenesis in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Based on our full-length transcriptomic data and the available genomic data, seven FAS genes (BgFas1-7) were identified from B. germanica. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that BgFas1, BgFas3, BgFas4 and BgFas7 were highly expressed in the integument, whereas BgFas2 was dominantly expressed in the fat body. BgFas5 / 6 mRNA was almost negligible in the tested tissues. Systemic RNAi screen was performed against BgFas1-7, we found that only RNAi knockdown of BgFas1 caused a dramatic reduction of methyl-branched HCs (mbHCs) and a slight decrease of straight-chain HCs (scHCs) for both internal and external HCs. Significant reduction of cuticular free fatty acids (cFFAs) was also detected within BgFas1-repressed cockroaches, while repression of CYP4G19 resulted in dramatic increase of cFFAs. Moreover, we found that BgFas1 mRNA levels were correlated with insect molting cycles, and could be induced by long-term mild dryness treatment. Furthermore, desiccation assay revealed that BgFas1 suppression accelerated water loss and led to early death of cockroaches under desiccation. Our results indicate that BgFas1 is necessary for both HC and cFFA biosynthesis in B. germanica. In addition, our study also confirms that cuticular lipids, particularly mbCHCs, are critical for desiccation resistance in B. germanica. "
negative,"Low substitution rates in mitochondrial DNA in Mediterranean carabid beetles. The estimation of DNA substitution rates requires calibration with the geological events which caused the separation of populations. We used the disintegration of the landbridges between Morocco and Gibraltar as well as the Balearics and Spain at the end of the Messinian event (5.3 myr) in order to calibrate the DNA sequence data of the NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) in West Mediterranean Carabus species. The rates of molecular evolution we found are much lower than those reported in the literature and also vary from species to species. Therefore, in insects the calculation of divergence periods using a constant 2% substitution rate per myr is questionable. "
negative,"Alterations and Interchange of Morphometric Characters in Different Life Cycle Stages with Reference to Genomic Variations of Anopheles subpictus (Diptera; Culicidae) Sibling Species Complex in Sri Lanka. The species complex of the mosquito Anopheles subpictus is designated by the sibling species A⁻D, depending on morphological characters of life cycle stages and variations in polytene chromosomes. However, morphological aberrations in the life cycle stages make the identification of sibling species uncertain and imprecise. The objective of the present study is to determine the suitability of morphological variations of sibling species and their genomic variations to identify the sibling species status of an An. subpictus population in Sri Lanka. Life cycle stages of larvae, pupal exuviae, and adults were examined for previously reported distinctive morphological features. Five nuclear and mitochondrial genome regions, including the Internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, D3 region, white gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), and Cytochrome b (Cyt-b), were sequenced and analyzed for variations. The eggs changed their distinct sibling morphological characters during metamorphosis (89.33%). The larvae, pupal exuviae, and adult stages showed deviation from their sibling characters by 26.10%, 19.71%, and 15.87%, respectively. However, all the species from the analysis shared two distinct sequence types for all regions, regardless of the morphological variations. In conclusion, the An. subpictus sibling species complex in Sri Lanka is not identifiable using morphological characters due to variations, and the genomic variations are independent from the morphological variations. "
negative,"Sequence analysis and genomic organization of a new insect iflavirus, Sogatella furcifera honeydew virus 1. A novel iflavirus, tentatively named ""Sogatella furcifera honeydew virus 1"" (SFHV1), discovered through transcriptome sequencing analysis of white-backed planthoppers (Sogatella furcifera) collected in southern China, is described here. The full genome of SFHV1 is 10,837 nucleotides (nt) long, including the polyA tail, and shares 65.5% and 64.5% genomic identity with Laodelphax striatellus picorna-like virus 2 and Laodelphax striatella honeydew virus 1, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence and the deduced RdRp amino acid sequence of SFHV1 with other iflaviruses, we suggest that it is a member of a new species in the genus Iflavirus, family Iflaviridae. "
negative,"Genomic analysis of the interaction between pesticide exposure and nutrition in honey bees (Apis mellifera). Populations of pollinators are in decline worldwide. These declines are best documented in honey bees and are due to a combination of stressors. In particular, pesticides have been linked to decreased longevity and performance in honey bees; however, the molecular and physiological pathways mediating sensitivity and resistance to pesticides are not well characterized. We explored the impact of coumaphos and fluvalinate, the two most abundant and frequently detected pesticides in the hive, on genome-wide gene expression patterns of honey bee workers. We found significant changes in 1118 transcripts, including genes involved in detoxification, behavioral maturation, immunity, and nutrition. Since behavioral maturation is regulated by juvenile hormone III (JH), we examined effects of these miticides on hormone titers; while JH titers were unaffected, titers of methyl farnesoate (MF), the precursor to JH, were decreased. We further explored the association between nutrition- and pesticide-regulated gene expression patterns and demonstrated that bees fed a pollen-based diet exhibit reduced sensitivity to a third pesticide, chlorpyrifos. Finally, we demonstrated that expression levels of several of the putative pesticide detoxification genes identified in our study and previous studies are also upregulated in response to pollen feeding, suggesting that these pesticides and components in pollen modulate similar molecular response pathways. Our results demonstrate that pesticide exposure can substantially impact expression of genes involved in several core physiological pathways in honey bee workers. Additionally, there is substantial overlap in responses to pesticides and pollen-containing diets at the transcriptional level, and subsequent analyses demonstrated that pollen-based diets reduce workers' pesticide sensitivity. Thus, providing honey bees and other pollinators with high quality nutrition may improve resistance to pesticides.  "
negative,"Medicago truncatula as a model for understanding plant interactions with other organisms, plant development and stress biology: past, present and future. Medicago truncatula Gaertn. cv. Jemalong, a pasture species used in Australian agriculture, was first proposed as a model legume in 1990. Since that time M. truncatula, along with Lotus japonicus (Regal) Larsen, has contributed to major advances in understanding rhizobia Nod factor perception and the signalling pathway involved in nodule formation. Research using M. truncatula as a model has expanded beyond nodulation and the allied mycorrhizal research to investigate interactions with insect pests, plant pathogens and nematodes. In addition to biotic stresses the genetic mechanisms to ameliorate abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought are being investigated. Furthermore, M. truncatula is being used to increase understanding of plant development and cellular differentiation, with nodule differentiation providing a different perspective to organogenesis and meristem biology. This legume plant represents one of the major evolutionary success stories of plant adaptation to its environment, and it is particularly in understanding the capacity to integrate biotic and abiotic plant responses with plant growth and development that M. truncatula has an important role to play. The expanding genomic and genetic toolkit available with M. truncatula provides many opportunities for integrative biological research with a plant which is both a model for functional genomics and important in agricultural sustainability. "
negative,"Bacterial origin of a diverse family of UDP-glycosyltransferase genes in the Tetranychus urticae genome. UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze the conjugation of a variety of small lipophilic molecules with uridine diphosphate (UDP) sugars, altering them into more water-soluble metabolites. Thereby, UGTs play an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the regulation of endobiotics. Recently, the genome sequence was reported for the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a polyphagous herbivore damaging a number of agricultural crops. Although various gene families implicated in xenobiotic metabolism have been documented in T. urticae, UGTs so far have not. We identified 80 UGT genes in the T. urticae genome, the largest number of UGT genes in a metazoan species reported so far. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lineage-specific gene expansions increased the diversity of the T. urticae UGT repertoire. Genomic distribution, intron-exon structure and structural motifs in the T. urticae UGTs were also described. In addition, expression profiling after host-plant shifts and in acaricide resistant lines supported an important role for UGT genes in xenobiotic metabolism. Expanded searches of UGTs in other arachnid species (Subphylum Chelicerata), including a spider, a scorpion, two ticks and two predatory mites, unexpectedly revealed the complete absence of UGT genes. However, a centipede (Subphylum Myriapoda) and a water flea and a crayfish (Subphylum Crustacea) contain UGT genes in their genomes similar to insect UGTs, suggesting that the UGT gene family might have been lost early in the Chelicerata lineage and subsequently re-gained in the tetranychid mites. Sequence similarity of T. urticae UGTs and bacterial UGTs and their phylogenetic reconstruction suggest that spider mites acquired UGT genes from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. Our findings show a unique evolutionary history of the T. urticae UGT gene family among other arthropods and provide important clues to its functions in relation to detoxification and thereby host adaptation.  "
negative,"[Progress in innate immunity-related genes in insects]. Insects have evolved a strong innate immune system to defense pathogens and adverse conditions. Insect innate immune system comprises of humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity mainly includes three signaling pathways, i.e., Toll, IMD and JAK / STAT, by which signal transduction and immune pathways regulate expression of immune-related genes and activate antimicrobial peptides and other effectors. Cellular immunity contains phagocytosis, encapsulation and nodulation of pathogens, which is mediated by hemolymph cells. In recent years, with the rapid development of insect genomics, a large number of immune-related genes have been characterized from insect genome data using bioinformatic methods. Studies on these genes have significantly deepened the understanding of molecular mechanisms of insect innate immune system. Insect immune-related genes can be divided into seven categories by gene functions: recognition, signaling transduction, modulator, effectors, melanization, RNA interference and other genes. The humoral immunity and cellular immunity are regulated by the interactions among these immune-related genes. In this review, we summarize the classification, function and evolution of insect immune-related genes, and propose future research directions of insect innate immunity, which will be helpful for understanding molecular mechanisms of insect innate immune system and developing new strategies for controlling pest insects. "
negative,"MicroRNA-2738 regulates gene expression in the sex determination pathway in Bombyx mori. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding transcripts that bind to 3'-untranslated regions to trigger messenger RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Here we explored how miRNAs regulate sex determination in Bombyx mori, a lepidopteran model insect. Genes known to be involved in sex determination, BmPSI, Bmdsx, and BmMasc, are predicted targets of the species-specific miR-2738. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells, we confirmed that miR-2738 suppressed transcription of BmPSI, Bmdsx, and BmMasc. The levels of BmPSI and BmMasc were significantly down-regulated in B. mori miR-2738 overexpression. In contrast, the genetic disruption of miR-2738 using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 transgenic system increased the levels of BmPSI and BmMasc transcripts, whereas splicing of Bmdsx was unaltered by miR-2738 depletion or overexpression. Taken together, this study implicates miR-2738 as a minor regulator of sex determination genes in the silkworm. "
negative,"Comparative genomic analysis of malaria mosquito vector-associated novel pathogen Elizabethkingia anophelis. Acquisition of Elizabethkingia infections in intensive care units (ICUs) has risen in the past decade. Treatment of Elizabethkingia infections is challenging due to the lack of effective therapeutic regimens, leading to a high mortality rate. Elizabethkingia infections have long been attributed to Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Recently, we used whole-genome sequencing to reveal that E. anophelis is the pathogenic agent for an Elizabethkingia outbreak at two ICUs. We performed comparative genomic analysis of seven hospital-isolated E. anophelis strains with five available Elizabethkingia spp. genomes deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Database. A pan-genomic approach was applied to identify the core- and pan-genome for the Elizabethkingia genus. We showed that unlike the hospital-isolated pathogen E. meningoseptica ATCC 12535 strain, the hospital-isolated E. anophelis strains have genome content and organization similar to the E. anophelis Ag1 and R26 strains isolated from the midgut microbiota of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. Both the core- and accessory genomes of Elizabethkingia spp. possess genes conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence. Our study highlights that E. anophelis is an emerging bacterial pathogen for hospital environments.  "
negative,"Development of a novel set of Gateway-compatible vectors for live imaging in insect cells. Insect genomics is a growing area of research. To exploit fully the genomic data that are being generated, high-throughput systems for the functional characterization of insect proteins and their interactomes are required. In this work, a Gateway-compatible vector set for expression of fluorescent fusion proteins in insect cells was developed. The vector set was designed to express a protein of interest fused to any of four different fluorescent proteins [green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and mCherry] by either the C-terminal or the N-terminal ends. Additionally, a collection of organelle-specific fluorescent markers was assembled for colocalization with fluorescent recombinant proteins of interest. Moreover, the vector set was proven to be suitable for simultaneously detecting up to three proteins by multiple labelling. The use of the vector set was exemplified by defining the subcellular distribution of Mal de Río Cuarto virus (MRCV) outer coat protein P10 and by analysing the in vivo self-interaction of the MRCV viroplasm matrix protein P9-1 in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. In conclusion, we have developed a valuable tool for high-throughput studies of protein subcellular localization that will aid in the elucidation of the function of newly described insect and virus proteins. "
negative,"Identification of a major Quantitative Trait Locus determining resistance to the organophosphate temephos in the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Organophosphate insecticides (OP) have extensively been used to control mosquitoes, such as the vector Aedes aegypti. Unfortunately, OP resistance has hampered control programs worldwide. We used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping to evaluate temephos resistance in two F1 intercross populations derived from crosses between a resistant Ae. aegypti strain (RecR) and two susceptible strains (MoyoD and Red). A single major effect QTL was identified on chromosome 2 of both segregating populations, named rtt1 (resistance to temephos 1). Bioinformatics analyses identified a cluster of carboxylesterase genes (CCE) within the rtt1 interval. qRT-PCR demonstrated that different CCEs were up-regulated in F2 resistant individuals from both crosses. However, none exceeded the 2-fold expression. Primary mechanisms for temephos resistance may vary between Ae. aegypti populations, yet also appear to support previous findings suggesting that multiple linked esterase genes may contribute to temephos resistance in the RecR strain as well as other populations. "
negative,"Impact of Insect Salivary Proteins in Blood Feeding, Host Immunity, Disease, and in the Development of Biomarkers for Vector Exposure. Functional genomic approaches based on expression of recombinant proteins linked to biochemical and disease model approaches resulted in the discovery of novel biological activities and the role some of these proteins play in disease transmission. Importantly, the expression of salivary proteins was recently shown to be affected by environmental factors and by the presence of the pathogen in the salivary gland. A practical application resulting from insect saliva research is the use of insect antigenic salivary protein as biomarkers of vector exposure in humans and animal reservoirs, an approach that is yielding interesting results in the field. "
negative,"Genome annotation and comparative analyses of the odorant-binding proteins and chemosensory proteins in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are two families of small water-soluble proteins, abundant in the aqueous fluid surrounding olfactory receptor neurons in insect antennae. OBPs are involved in the first step of olfactory signal transduction, carrying airborne semiochemicals to the odorant receptors and can be classified into three groups: Classic OBPs, Plus-C OBPs and Atypical OBPs. Here, we identified and annotated genes encoding putative OBPs and CSPs in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum using bioinformatics. This identified genes encoding 13 Classic and two Plus-C OBPs and 13 CSPs. Homologous OBP sequences were also identified in nine other aphid species, allowing us to compare OBPs across several aphid and non-aphid species. We show that, although OBP sequences are divergent within a species and between different orders, there is a high similarity between orthologs within a range of aphid species. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships between OBP orthologs reflect the divergence of aphid evolution lineages. Our results support the 'birth-and-death' model as the major mechanism explaining aphid OBP sequence evolution, with the main force acting on the evolution being purifying selection. "
negative,"A synthetic early promoter from a baculovirus: roles of the TATA box and conserved start site CAGT sequence in basal levels of transcription. Many baculovirus early genes and insect genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II have a conserved transcription start site sequence (CAGT) located downstream of a consensus TATA box. To examine the functions and interactions of these two motifs in initiating accurately positioned basal transcription, a 43-nt synthetic promoter was synthesized from the TATA box and start site sequences of the gp64 early promoter from the Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (OpMNPV). The synthetic promoter initiated accurately and was also transactivated by the baculovirus transcriptional activator, IE1. To determine the roles of sequences within the 43-nt synthetic promoter, a series of linker-scanning and spacing mutations were analyzed for transcriptional activity, start site selection, and transactivation. Linker-scanning mutations were examined in vivo by transient expression and reporter gene assays. To examine transcription start site selection, promoter constructs were used for in vitro transcription in nuclear extracts from uninfected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. In vivo and in vitro analyses show that the TATA box, and not the start site CAGT, is the primary element controlling start site selection. Substitution of the conserved start site CAGT sequence resulted in a reduction of both reporter gene activity and in vitro transcripts, although transcripts initiated accurately. Data from linker-scanning and spacing mutations indicate that the conserved start site CAGT sequences are not required for accurate initiation but sequences at the start site play an important role in initiation efficiency. "
negative,"Genome sequence of the insect pathogenic fungus Cordyceps militaris, a valued traditional Chinese medicine. BACKGROUND: Species in the ascomycete fungal genus Cordyceps have been proposed to be the teleomorphs of Metarhizium species. The latter have been widely used as insect biocontrol agents. Cordyceps species are highly prized for use in traditional Chinese medicines, but the genes responsible for biosynthesis of bioactive components, insect pathogenicity and the control of sexuality and fruiting have not been determined. RESULTS: Here, we report the genome sequence of the type species Cordyceps militaris. Phylogenomic analysis suggests that different species in the Cordyceps / Metarhizium genera have evolved into insect pathogens independently of each other, and that their similar large secretomes and gene family expansions are due to convergent evolution. However, relative to other fungi, including Metarhizium spp., many protein families are reduced in C. militaris, which suggests a more restricted ecology. Consistent with its long track record of safe usage as a medicine, the Cordyceps genome does not contain genes for known human mycotoxins. We establish that C. militaris is sexually heterothallic but, very unusually, fruiting can occur without an opposite mating-type partner. Transcriptional profiling indicates that fruiting involves induction of the Zn2Cys6-type transcription factors and MAPK pathway; unlike other fungi, however, the PKA pathway is not activated. CONCLUSIONS: The data offer a better understanding of Cordyceps biology and will facilitate the exploitation of medicinal compounds produced by the fungus. "
negative,"Genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp. strain HA, isolated from the gut of the polyphagous insect pest Helicoverpa armigera. In this study, Acinetobacter sp. strain HA was isolated from the midgut of a fifth-instar larva of Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we report the draft genome sequence (3,125,085 bp) of this strain that consists of 102 contigs, 2,911 predicted coding sequences, and a G+C content of 41%. "
positive,"Double-stranded RNA targeting calmodulin reveals a potential target for pest management of Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: Calmodulin (CaM) is an essential protein in cellular activity and plays important roles in many processes in insect development. RNA interference (RNAi) has been hypothesized to be a promising method for pest control. CaM is a good candidate for RNAi target. However, the sequence and function of CaM in Nilaparvata lugens are unknown. Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) target to CaM gene in pest control is still unavailable. RESULTS: In the present study, two alternatively spliced variants of CaM transcripts, designated NlCaM1 and NlCaM2, were cloned from N. lugens. The two cDNA sequences exhibited 100% identity to each other in the open reading frame (ORF), and only differed in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). NlCaM including NlCaM1 and NlCaM2 mRNA was detectable in all developmental stages and tissues of N. lugens, with significantly increased expression in the salivary glands. Knockdown of NlCaM expression by RNAi with different dsRNAs led to an inability to molt properly, increased mortality, which ranged from 49.7 to 92.5%, impacted development of the ovaries and led to female infertility. There were no significant reductions in the transcript levels of vitellogenin and its receptor or in the total vitellogenin protein level relative to the control group. However, a significant reduction in vitellogenin protein was detected in ovaries injected with dsNlCaM. In addition, a specific dsRNA of NlCaM for control of N. lugens was designed and tested. CONCLUSION: NlCaM plays important roles mainly in nymph development and uptake of vitellogenin by ovaries in vitellogenesis in N. lugens. dsRNA derived from the less conserved 3'-UTR of NlCaM shows great potential for RNAi-based N. lugens management. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Recent findings in evolution and function of insect innexins. The past decade has seen significant advances in the field of innexin biology, particularly in the model invertebrate organisms, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, advances in genomics and functional techniques during this same period are ushering in a period of comparative innexin biology. Insects are the most diverse metazoan taxa in terms of species number, as well as in developmental, physiological, and morphological processes. Combined with genomics data, the study of innexins should rapidly advance. In this review, we consider the current state of knowledge regarding innexins in insects, focusing on innexin diversity, both evolutionary and functional. We also consider an unusual set of innexins, known as vinnexins, that have been isolated from mutualistic viruses of some parasitoid wasps. We conclude with a call to study insect innexins from a broader, evolutionary perspective. Knowledge derived from such comparative studies will offer significant insight into developmental and evolutionary physiology, as well as specific functional processes in a taxon that has huge biomedical and ecological impact on humans.  "
negative,"Landscape genomics of Colorado potato beetle provides evidence of polygenic adaptation to insecticides. The ability of insect pests to rapidly and repeatedly adapt to insecticides has long challenged entomologists and evolutionary biologists. Since Crow's seminal paper on insecticide resistance in 1957, new data and insights continue to emerge that are relevant to the old questions about how insecticide resistance evolves: such as whether it is predominantly mono- or polygenic, and evolving from standing vs. de novo genetic variation. Many studies support the monogenic hypothesis, and current management recommendations assume single- or two-locus models. But inferences could be improved by integrating data from a broader sample of pest populations and genomes. Here, we generate evidence relevant to these questions by applying a landscape genomics framework to the study of insecticide resistance in a major agricultural pest, Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). Genome-environment association tests using genomic variation from 16 populations spanning gradients of landscape variables associated with insecticide exposure over time revealed 42 strong candidate insecticide resistance genes, with potentially overlapping roles in multiple resistance mechanisms. Measurements of resistance to a widely used insecticide, imidacloprid, among 47 L. decemlineata populations revealed heterogeneity at a small (2 km) scale and no spatial signature of origin or spread throughout the landscape. Analysis of nucleotide diversity suggested candidate resistance loci have undergone varying degrees of selective sweeps, often maintaining similar levels of nucleotide diversity to neutral loci. This study suggests that many genes are involved in insecticide resistance in L. decemlineata and that resistance likely evolves from both de novo and standing genetic variation. "
negative,"MorusDB: a resource for mulberry genomics and genome biology. Mulberry is an important cultivated plant that has received the attention of biologists interested in sericulture and plant-insect interaction. Morus notabilis, a wild mulberry species with a minimal chromosome number is an ideal material for whole-genome sequencing and assembly. The genome and transcriptome of M. notabilis were sequenced and analyzed. In this article, a web-based and open-access database, the Morus Genome Database (MorusDB), was developed to enable easy-to-access and data mining. The MorusDB provides an integrated data source and an easy accession of mulberry large-scale genomic sequencing and assembly, predicted genes and functional annotations, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), transposable elements (TEs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms, horizontal gene transfers between mulberry and silkworm and ortholog and paralog groups. Transcriptome sequencing data for M. notabilis root, leaf, bark, winter bud and male flower can also be searched and downloaded. Furthermore, MorusDB provides an analytical workbench with some built-in tools and pipelines, such as BLAST, Search GO, Mulberry GO and Mulberry GBrowse, to facilitate genomic studies and comparative genomics. The MorusDB provides important genomic resources for scientists working with mulberry and other Moraceae species, which include many important fruit crops. Designed as a basic platform and accompanied by the SilkDB, MorusDB strives to be a comprehensive platform for the silkworm-mulberry interaction studies.

negative,"Characterization of the complete mitochondrial genome of Biston marginata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) and phylogenetic analysis among lepidopteran insects. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Biston marginata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) was determined and annotated. The circular genome is 15,470bp long and it contains the entire set of 37 genes usually present in lepidopteran mitogenomes. The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A+T biased, accounting for 81.20%, with a slightly positive AT skewness (0.028), indicating the occurrence of more As than Ts, as found in other Geometridae species. Except for cox1 gene starts with non-canonical initial codon CGA, all protein-coding genes start with ATN codon. Three of the 13 PCGs (protein coding gene) had an incomplete termination codon, T or TA, while the others terminated with TAA. All tRNA genes are predicted to fold into typical clover-leaf secondary structure, except for the trnS1 (AGN), in which the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm could not form a stable stem-loop structure. The A+T-rich region of 343bp is comprised of non-repetitive sequences, but have several distinctive features, including the motif ""ATAGA"" followed by a 19bp poly-T stretch, a microsatellite-like (TA)7 element next to the ATTTA motif. The phylogenetic analyses support the view that the B. marginata is closely related to the Biston pantrinaria, and confirm that Biston marginata belongs to the family Geometridae. "
negative,"Genomic targeting by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange in the spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii. Drosophila suzukii is a significant pest of stone and small fruits. The genome of this species has been sequenced and manipulated by transposon-mediated transformation and CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing. These technologies open a variety of possibilities for functional genomics and genetic modifications that might improve biologically based population control strategies. Both of these approaches, however, would benefit from genome targeting that would avoid position effects and insertional mutations associated with random transposon vector insertions, and the limited DNA fragment insertion size allowed by gene editing. Here, we describe an efficient recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) system for D. suzukii in which heterospecific lox recombination sites were integrated into the genome by transposon-mediated transformation and subsequently targeted for double recombination by a donor vector in the presence of Cre recombinase. Three loxN / lox2272 landing site lines have previously been created in D. suzukii, and quantitative PCR determined that polyubiquitin-regulated enhanced green fluorescent protein expression is least susceptible to position effect suppression in the 443_M26m1 line. We presume that RMCE target sites may also be inserted more specifically into the genome by homology-directed repair gene editing, thereby avoiding position effects and mutations, while eliminating restrictions on the size of donor constructs for subsequent insertion. "
negative,"The neuropeptides and protein hormones of the agricultural pest fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis: What do we learn from the genome sequencing and tissue-specific transcriptomes? Neuropeptides and protein hormones are very important signaling molecules, and are involved in the regulation and coordination of various physiological processes in invertebrates and vertebrates. Using a bioinformatics approach, we screened the recently sequenced genome and six tissue-specific transcriptome databases (central nervous system, fat body, ovary, testes, male accessory glands, antennae) of the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) that is economically one of the most important pest insects of tropical and subtropical fruit. Thirty-nine candidate genes were found to encode neuropeptides or protein hormones. These include most of the known insect neuropeptides and protein hormones, with the exception of adipokinetic hormone-corazonin-related peptide, allatropin, diuretic hormone 34, diuretic hormone 45, IMFamide, inotocin, and sex peptide. Our results showed the neuropeptides and protein hormones of Diptera insects appear to have a reduced repertoire compared to some other insects. Moreover, there are also differences between B. dorsalis and the super-model of Drosophila melanogaster. Interesting features of the oriental fruit fly are the absence of genes coding for sex peptide and the presence of neuroparsin and two genes coding neuropeptide F. The majority of the identified neuropeptides and protein hormones is present in the central nervous system, with only a limited number of these in the other tissues. Moreover, we predicted their physiological functions via comparing with data of FlyBase and FlyAtlas. Taken together, owing to the large number of identified peptides, this study can be used as a reference about structure, tissue distribution and physiological functions for comparative studies in other model and important pest insects. "
negative,"Sequence and organization of the mitochondrial genome of the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma dimidiata. The 17 019 bp mitochondrial genome of Triatoma dimidiata is composed of thirteen protein coding sequences, twenty-two tRNAs, small and large ribosomal units, and a control region. The gene order and orientation are identical to that of Drosophila yakuba. The nucleotide composition is biased toward adenine and thymine (69.5% A + T). The 2.1 kb putative control region, known as the A + T rich region in most insects, has an A + T bias of 66%, but contains a 400 bp sequence that is 77.5% A + T and two other distinct regions: (1) one with a lower A + T bias (60.1%) and (2) a region of eight tandem repeat units. The identified 1.4 kb nuclear copy of mitochondrial sequences encompasses the string of Gs and the beginning of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene but lacks the 1.8 kb region spanning the eight tandem repeats and the 5' end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit II gene. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and comparison with other Pyraloidea insects. The mitochondrial (mt) genome can provide important information for the understanding of phylogenetic relationships. The complete mt genome of Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) has been sequenced. The circular genome is 15 287 bp in size, encoding 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region. The AT skew of this mt genome is slightly negative, and the nucleotide composition is biased toward A+T nucleotides (80.15%). All PCGs start with the typical ATN (ATA, ATC, ATG, and ATT) codons, except for the cox1 gene which may start with the CGA codon. Four of the 13 PCGs harbor the incomplete termination codon T or TA. All the tRNA genes are folded into the typical clover-leaf structure of mitochondrial tRNA, except for trnS1 (AGN) in which the DHU arm fails to form a stable stem-loop structure. The overlapping sequences are 35 bp in total and are found in seven different locations. A total of 240 bp of intergenic spacers are scattered in 16 regions. The control region of the mt genome is 327 bp in length and consisted of several features common to the sequenced lepidopteran insects. Phylogenetic analysis based on 13 PCGs using the Maximum Likelihood method shows that the placement of P. interpunctella was within the Pyralidae.  "
negative,"Iso-Seq analysis of Nepenthes ampullaria, Nepenthes rafflesiana and Nepenthes × hookeriana for hybridisation study in pitcher plants. Tropical pitcher plants in the species-rich Nepenthaceae family of carnivorous plants possess unique pitcher organs. Hybridisation, natural or artificial, in this family is extensive resulting in pitchers with diverse features. The pitcher functions as a passive insect trap with digestive fluid for nutrient acquisition in nitrogen-poor habitats. This organ shows specialisation according to the dietary habit of different Nepenthes species. In this study, we performed the first single-molecule real-time isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) analysis of full-length cDNA from Nepenthes ampullaria which can feed on leaf litter, compared to carnivorous Nepenthes rafflesiana, and their carnivorous hybrid Nepenthes × hookeriana. This allows the comparison of pitcher transcriptomes from the parents and the hybrid to understand how hybridisation could shape the evolution of dietary habit in Nepenthes. Raw reads have been deposited to SRA database with the accession numbers SRX2692198 (N. ampullaria), SRX2692197 (N. rafflesiana), and SRX2692196 (N. × hookeriana). "
negative,"CRISPR / Cas9-based mutation reveals Argonaute 1 is essential for pigmentation in Ostrinia furnacalis. Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is one of the most destructive agricultural pests in Asia. Traditional pest-management methods include sex pheromone capture, transgenic crops that produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxin, and pesticides. Although these strategies control pest populations effectively, they also cause negative side effects, including dramatically increased pesticide resistance, severe pollution, and hazards for human health. Recently developed genome editing tools provide new prospects for pest management and have been successfully used in several species. However, few examples have been reported in the agricultural pest O. furnacalis due to a lack in genomic information. In this report, we identified only one transcript of O. furnacalis Argonaute 1 (OfAgo1) gene from the genome and cloned the open reading frame. OfAgo1 presented the maximum expression at the embryo stage or in the fat body during the larval stages. To understand its function, an OfAgo1 mutant was constructed using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat / RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR / Cas9). Mutagenesis of OfAgo1 disrupted cuticle pigmentation by down-regulating micro RNAs and pigmentation-related genes. This is the first report for the cloning and functional analysis of OfAgo1, revealing a role of OfAgo1 in cuticle pigmentation. The current report also established a CRISPR / Cas9 system in O. furnacalis, providing a new insight for pest management. "
negative,"Intrinsic bent DNA sites in the developmentally amplified C3-22 gene promoter of Rhynchosciara americana (Diptera: Sciaridae). The Rhynchosciara americana C3-22 gene is located in an amplified domain and is developmentally expressed. The aim of the present work was to identify intrinsically bent DNA sites in a segment containing the gene promoter and downstream sequence. The results indicated that this gene is flanked by intrinsically bent DNA sites. Three bent DNA sites (b(-3), b(-2), and b(-1)) were localized in the promoter, and one was localized downstream of the gene (b(+1)). These sites had helical parameters that confirmed the curved structure, as well as segments with left-handed superhelical writhe. In silico analysis of the promoters of four other insect genes, which encode secreted polypeptides, showed that they all had curved structures and similar helical parameters. Correlation with other results indicates that the detected intrinsically bent DNA sites that flank the C3-22 gene might be a consensus feature of the gene structure in the amplified domains. "
positive,"Apoptosis-mediated vasa down-regulation controls developmental transformation in Japanese Copidosoma floridanum female soldiers. Copidosoma floridanum is a polyembryonic, caste-forming, wasp species. The ratio of investment in different castes changes with environmental stressors (e.g. multi-parasitism with competitors). The vasa gene was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster as a germ-cell-determining factor, and C. floridanum vasa (Cf-vas) gene positive cells have been known to develop into reproductive larvae. Cf-vas seems to control the ratio of investment in C. floridanum larval castes. In this study, we identified environmental factors that control Cf-vas mRNA expression in Japanese C. floridanum by examining Cf-vas mRNA expression under competitor (Meteorus pulchricornis) venom stress; we treated the male and female morulae with M. pulchricornis venom. We also assessed the effects of multi-parasitism of Japanese C. floridanum with M. pulchricornis and found an increasing number of female soldier larvae. The results showed that several amino acid sequences differ between the Japanese and US Cf-vas. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that Japanese Cf-vas mRNA is expressed in both male and female larvae and pupae, but mRNA expression decreases in adults. Cf-vas mRNA expression significantly decreased, while C. floridanum dronc (Cf-dronc) mRNA expression increased, in female morulae after M. pulchricornis venom treatment at 20 h and 0 h of the culture period, respectively. Females and males showed different Cf-vas or Cf-dronc mRNA expression after M. pulchricornis venom treatment. Therefore, M. pulchricornis venom could affect the ratio of investment in different female castes of Japanese C. floridanum by decreasing Cf-vas mRNA expression via apoptosis. "
negative,"Characterization of the multicopper oxidase gene family in Anopheles gambiae. The multicopper oxidase (MCO) family of enzymes includes laccases, which oxidize a broad range of substrates including diphenols, and several oxidases with specific substrates such as iron, copper or ascorbic acid. We have identified five putative MCO genes in the genome of Anopheles gambiae and have cloned cDNAs encompassing the full coding region for each gene. MCO1 mRNA was detected in all developmental stages and in all of the larval and adult tissues tested. We observed an increase in MCO1 transcript abundance in the midguts and Malphighian tubules of adult females following a blood meal and in adult abdominal carcasses in response to an immune challenge. Two alternatively spliced isoforms of MCO2 mRNA were identified. The A isoform of MCO2 was previously detected in larval and pupal cuticle where it probably catalyzes sclerotization reactions (He, N., Botelho, J.M.C., McNall, R.J., Belozerov, V., Dunn, W.A., Mize, T., Orlando, R., Willis, J.H., 2007. Proteomic analysis of cast cuticles from Anopheles gambiae by tandem mass spectrometry. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 37, 135-146). The B isoform was transcriptionally upregulated in ovaries in response to a blood meal. MCO3 mRNA was detected in the adult midgut, Malpighian tubules, and male reproductive tissues; like MCO1, it was upregulated in response to an immune challenge or a blood meal. MCO4 and MCO5 were observed primarily in eggs and in the abdominal carcass of larvae. A phylogenetic analysis of insect MCO genes identified putative orthologs of MCO1 and MCO2 in all of the insect genomes tested, whereas MCO3, MCO4 and MCO5 were found only in the two mosquito species analyzed. MCO2 orthologs have especially high sequence similarity, suggesting that they are under strong purifying selection; the A isoforms are more conserved than the B isoforms. The mosquito specific group shares a common ancestor with MCO2. This initial study of mosquito MCOs suggests that MCO2 may be required for egg development or eggshell tanning in addition to cuticle tanning, while MCO1 and MCO3 may be involved in metal metabolism or immunity. "
negative,"Enzymatic characterization of a trypsin-like serine protease encoded by the genome of cell fusing agent virus. Cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) is a positive strand RNA insect virus first isolated from a mosquito cell line. Based on viral morphology, phenotypic and phylogenetic studies, CFAV had been tentatively assigned to the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae). The determination of the CFAV polyprotein complete sequence showed a putative serine protease domain analogue to the flaviviral NS2B / NS3 complex. This complex had been extensively studied, because it represented one of the main targets for antiflavivirus therapy development. We report herein the biochemical characterization of CFAV DeltaNS2B-NS3pro protease complex. CFAV polyprotein sequence was computationally analysed to identify the amino-acid regions involved in protease activity. We designed, expressed and purified a catalytically active protease whose enzymatic properties were determined using fluorogenic substrates. Our results showed that, despite the low level of conservation of its amino-acid sequence, CFAV protease exhibited physico-chemical properties of other flaviviruses (high pH value requirement for optimal activity, inhibition by salt and preference for substrates featuring a basic residue at P(1) position). "
positive,"MicroRNA and dsRNA targeting chitin synthase A reveal a great potential for pest management of the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: Two RNA silencing pathways in insects are known to exist that are mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which have been hypothesised to be promising methods for insect pest control. However, a comparison between miRNA and siRNA in pest control is still unavailable, particularly in targeting chitin synthase gene A (CHSA). RESULTS: The dsRNA for Nilaparvata lugens CHSA (dsNlCHSA) and the microR-2703 (miR-2703) mimic targeting NlCHSA delivered via feeding affected the development of nymphs, reduced their chitin content and led to lethal phenotypes. The protein level of NlCHSA was downregulated after female adults were injected with dsNlCHSA or the miR-2703 mimic, but there were no significant differences in vitellogenin (NlVg) expression or in total oviposition relative to the control group. However, 90.68 and 46.13% of the eggs laid by the females injected with dsNlCHSA and miR-2703 mimic were unable to hatch, respectively. In addition, a second-generation miRNA and RNAi effect on N. lugens was observed. CONCLUSION: Ingested miR-2703 seems to be a good option for killing N. lugens nymphs, while NlCHSA may be a promising target for RNAi-based pest management. These findings provide important evidence for applications of small non-coding RNAs (snRNAs) in insect pest management. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"The Malpighian tubule: rapid insights from post-genomic biology. Good osmoregulation is critical to the success of insects, and the Malpighian tubules play a key role in osmoregulation. Recently, the application of genetics and genomics to the Drosophila tubule has revealed far more extensive roles than ion and water transport. Microarray analysis shows that organic solute transporters dominate the tubule transcriptome. The tubule thus has the capability to excrete actively the broadest range of organic solutes and xenobiotics. Such transporters can produce unexpected, emergent roles for the whole tissue; e.g. the tubule is highly resistant to ouabain not because the Na+, K+ ATPase is unimportant, but because it co-localises with a potent alkaloid excretory mechanism. Reinforcing this role in excretion, the tubule expresses very high levels of a particular cytochrome P450s, glutathione-S-transferases and alcohol dehydrogenases which suggest that the tubule plays a major role in metabolism and detoxification of both endogenous solutes and xenobiotics, such as insecticides. Additionally, the tubule plays a significant role in immunity; tubules are capable of sensing bacterial challenge, and mounting an effective killing response by secretion of antimicrobial peptides, entirely independent of the fat body, the canonical immune tissue. The tubule has also proved to be a good model for some human renal disease, and to act as an organotypic 'testbed' for mammalian genes. The tubule can thus bask in a greatly enhanced reputation as a key tissue for an unexpectedly wide range of functions in the insect. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Thitarodes sejilaensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), a host insect of Ophiocordyceps sinensis and its implication in taxonomic revision of Hepialus adopted in China. The mitochondrial genome is widely used for phylogenetic analyses and evolutionary biology. The complete mitochondrial genome of Thitarodes sejilaensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) was sequenced and analyzed in this study. This mitogenome is a typical circular molecule of 15,290bp, with the gene content, orientation and order identical to other insects in the family Hepialidae. The genome nucleotide composition is heavily biased towards As and Ts, accounting for 80.87% of total nucleotide content. The major strand shows a positive AT-skew and negative GC-skew. All 13 protein-coding genes (PCG) are initiated by the canonical putative start codons ATN, except for COI and ND1 that use the initiation codons CGA and TTG, respectively. Nine PCGs share the complete termination codons TAA, while the remaining PCGs use an incomplete termination codon T. Additionally, the codon distribution and Relative Synonymous Codon Usage of all PCGs in the T. sejilaensis mitogenome are consistent with other Hepialidae mitogenomes. Among 22 transfer RNAs, 21 have the typical clover-leaf structure, while tRNASer(AGN) does not possess the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm and could not form a stable stem-loop structure. The secondary structures of 2 ribosomal RNA genes broadly conform to the proposed models of these genes documented in other lepidopteran insects. T. sejilaensis AT-rich region exhibits three repetitive sequences of 118bp. Other regions contain 22-bp overlapping nucleotides and 72-bp intergenic nucleotides. The phylogenetic relationships were constructed by two datasets, the amino acid sequence derived from protein-coding genes and the nucleotide sequence of 13 PCGs and 2 rRNAs. Using Maximum Likelihood (ML), we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree which supported a more primitive taxa of Hepialoidea within Lepidoptera. Moreover, according to comparisons based on the CytB sequences and morphological characteristic, Hepialus species reported in China should be revised. Our taxonomic recommendations include assigning these species to the following genera: Thitarodes, Ahamus, Hepialus and Parahepialus. "
negative,"Identification of spontaneous mutation for broad-spectrum brown planthopper resistance in a large, long-term fast neutron mutagenized rice population. BACKGROUND: The development of rice varieties with broad-spectrum resistance to insect pests is the most promising approach for controlling a fast evolving insect pest such as the brown planthopper (BPH). To cope with rapid evolution, discovering new sources of broad-spectrum resistance genes is the ultimate goal. RESULTS: We used a forward genetics approach to identify BPH resistance genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) using double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) for quantitative trait loci (QTL)-seq of the backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between the BPH-susceptible cultivar KDML105 and BPH-resistant cultivar Rathu Heenati (RH). Two major genomic regions, located between 5.78-7.78 Mb (QBPH4.1) and 15.22-17.22 Mb (QBPH4.2) on rice chromosome 4, showed association with BPH resistance in both pooled BILs and individual highly resistant and susceptible BILs. The two most significant candidate resistance genes located within the QBPH4.1 and QBPH4.2 windows were lectin receptor kinase 3 (OsLecRK3) and sesquiterpene synthase 2 (OsSTPS2), respectively. Functional markers identified in these two genes were used for reverse screening 9323 lines of the fast neutron (FN)-mutagenized population developed from the BPH-susceptible, purple-pigmented, indica cultivar Jao Hom Nin (JHN). Nineteen FN-mutagenized lines (0.24%) carried mutations in the OsLecRK3 and / or OsSTPS2 gene. Among these mutant lines, only one highly resistant line (JHN4) and three moderately resistant lines (JHN09962, JHN12005, and JHN19525) were identified using three active, local BPH populations. The 19 mutant lines together with three randomly selected mutant lines, which did not harbor mutations in the two target genes, were screened further for mutations in six known BPH resistance genes including BPH9, BPH14, BPH18, BPH26, BPH29, and BPH32. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion-deletion (Indel) mutations were identified, which formed gene-specific haplotype patterns (HPs) essential for broad-spectrum resistance to BPH in both BILs and JHN mutant populations. CONCLUSION: On the one hand, HPs of OsLekRK2-3, OsSTPS2, and BPH32 determined broad-spectrum resistance to BPH among RH-derived BILs. On the other hand, in the JHN mutant population, BPH9 together with seven significant genes on chromosome 4 played a crucial role in BPH resistance. "
negative,"Genome, transcriptome and methylome sequencing of a primitively eusocial wasp reveal a greatly reduced DNA methylation system in a social insect. Comparative genomics of social insects has been intensely pursued in recent years with the goal of providing insights into the evolution of social behaviour and its underlying genomic and epigenomic basis. However, the comparative approach has been hampered by a paucity of data on some of the most informative social forms (e.g. incipiently and primitively social) and taxa (especially members of the wasp family Vespidae) for studying social evolution. Here, we provide a draft genome of the primitively eusocial model insect Polistes dominula, accompanied by analysis of caste-related transcriptome and methylome sequence data for adult queens and workers. Polistes dominula possesses a fairly typical hymenopteran genome, but shows very low genomewide GC content and some evidence of reduced genome size. We found numerous caste-related differences in gene expression, with evidence that both conserved and novel genes are related to caste differences. Most strikingly, these -omics data reveal a major reduction in one of the major epigenetic mechanisms that has been previously suggested to be important for caste differences in social insects: DNA methylation. Along with a conspicuous loss of a key gene associated with environmentally responsive DNA methylation (the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3), these wasps have greatly reduced genomewide methylation to almost zero. In addition to providing a valuable resource for comparative analysis of social insect evolution, our integrative -omics data for this important behavioural and evolutionary model system call into question the general importance of DNA methylation in caste differences and evolution in social insects. "
negative,"Biodiversity of active and inactive bacteria in the gut flora of wood-feeding huhu beetle larvae (Prionoplus reticularis). Huhu grubs (Prionoplus reticularis) are wood-feeding beetle larvae endemic to New Zealand and belonging to the family Cerambycidae. Compared to the wood-feeding lower termites, very little is known about the diversity and activity of microorganisms associated with xylophagous cerambycid larvae. To address this, we used pyrosequencing to evaluate the diversity of metabolically active and inactive bacteria in the huhu larval gut. Our estimate, that the gut harbors at least 1,800 phylotypes, is based on 33,420 sequences amplified from genomic DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA. Analysis of genomic DNA- and RNA-derived data sets revealed that 71% of all phylotypes (representing 95% of all sequences) were metabolically active. Rare phylotypes contributed considerably to the richness of the community and were also largely metabolically active, indicating their participation in digestive processes in the gut. The dominant families in the active community (RNA data set) included Acidobacteriaceae (24.3%), Xanthomonadaceae (16.7%), Acetobacteraceae (15.8%), Burkholderiaceae (8.7%), and Enterobacteriaceae (4.1%). The most abundant phylotype comprised 14% of the active community and affiliated with Dyella ginsengisoli (Gammaproteobacteria), suggesting that a Dyella-related organism is a likely symbiont. This study provides new information on the diversity and activity of gut-associated microorganisms that are essential for the digestion of the nutritionally poor diet consumed by wood-feeding larvae. Many huhu gut phylotypes affiliated with insect symbionts or with bacteria present in acidic environments or associated with fungi. "
negative,"Evolutionary trends of digestion and absorption in the major insect orders. The spatial organization of digestion, which corresponds to the steps by which the ingested food is hydrolyzed in the different regions of the gut, was described in insects from the major insect orders. The pattern of digestion and absorption in the midgut shows a strong phylogenetic influence, modulated by adaptation to particular feeding habits. Based on this, basic digestive patterns were recognized and were proposed to represent the major ancestors from which the different orders evolved. The putative ancestors chosen to represent different points in the evolution from basal Neoptera to more derived orders were: Neoptera, Polyneoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera-Panorpoidea (Diptera-Lepidoptera), Lepidoptera, and Cyclorrhapha. The basic plan of Neoptera was supposed to be alike that of Polyneoptera, which was hypothesized from studies performed in grasshoppers, crickets and from stick insects. For Holometabola, the basic plan was initially proposed from studies carried out in beetles, bees, nematocerous flies, common flies and also from moths. This review updates the physiological data supporting the putative midgut basic patterns by discussing available data on insects pertaining to different taxa and details the evolutionary trends of midgut function among the major insect orders. Furthermore, by using recent genomic and transcriptome data, this review discusses the few insects for which the spatial organization of midgut absorption is known. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of alternative reproductive phenotypes in honeybee workers. A defining feature of social insects is the reproductive division of labour, in which workers usually forego all reproduction to help their mother queen to reproduce. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this spectacular form of altruism. Here, we compared gene expression patterns between nonreproductive, altruistic workers and reproductive, non-altruistic workers in queenless honeybee colonies using a whole-genome microarray analysis. Our results demonstrate massive differences in gene expression patterns between these two sets of workers, with a total of 1292 genes being differentially expressed. In nonreproductive workers, genes associated with energy metabolism and respiration, flight and foraging behaviour, detection of visible light, flight and heart muscle contraction and synaptic transmission were overexpressed relative to reproductive workers. This implies they probably had a higher whole-body energy metabolism and activity rate and were most likely actively foraging, whereas same-aged reproductive workers were not. This pattern is predicted from evolutionary theory, given that reproductive workers should be less willing to compromise their reproductive futures by carrying out high-risk tasks such as foraging or other energetically expensive tasks. By contrast, reproductive workers mainly overexpressed oogenesis-related genes compared to nonreproductive ones. With respect to key switches for ovary activation, several genes involved in steroid biosynthesis were upregulated in reproductive workers, as well as genes known to respond to queen and brood pheromones, genes involved in TOR and insulin signalling pathways and genes located within quantitative trait loci associated with reproductive capacity in honeybees. Overall, our results provide unique insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying alternative reproductive phenotypes in honeybee workers. "
negative,"Phenotypic and molecular characterization of Hessian fly resistance in diploid wheat, Aegilops tauschii. BACKGROUND: The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), belonging to the gall midge family (Cecidomyiidae), is a devastating pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) causing significant yield losses. Despite identification and characterization of numerous Hessian fly-responsive genes and associated biological pathways involved in wheat defense against this dipteran pest, their functional validation has been challenging. This is largely attributed to the large genome, polyploidy, repetitive DNA, and limited genetic resources in hexaploid wheat. The diploid progenitor Aegilops tauschii, D-genome donor of modern-day hexaploid wheat, offers an ideal surrogate eliminating the need to target all three homeologous chromosomes (A, B and D) individually, and thereby making the functional validation of candidate Hessian fly-responsive genes plausible. Furthermore, the well-annotated sequence of Ae. tauschii genome and availability of genetic resources amenable to manipulations makes the functional assays less tedious and time-consuming. However, prior to utilization of this diploid genome for downstream studies, it is imperative to characterize its physical and molecular responses to Hessian fly. RESULTS: In this study we screened five Ae. tauschii accessions for their response to the Hessian fly biotypes L and vH13. Two lines were identified that exhibited a homozygous resistance response to feeding by both Hessian fly biotypes. Studies using physical measurements and neutral red staining showed that the resistant Ae. tauschii accessions resembled hexaploid wheat in their phenotypic responses to Hessian fly, that included similarities in larval developmental stages, leaf and plant growth, and cell wall permeability. Furthermore, molecular responses, characterized by gene expression profiling using quantitative real-time PCR, in select resistant Ae. tauschii lines also revealed similarities with resistant hexaploid wheat. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic and molecular characterization of Ae. tauschii to Hessian fly infestation revealed resistant accessions that shared similarities to hexaploid wheat. Resembling the resistant hexaploid wheat, the Ae. tauschii accessions mount an early defense strategy involving defense proteins including lectins, secondary metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) radicals. Our results reveal the suitability of the diploid progenitor for use as an ideal tool for functional genomics research in deciphering the wheat-Hessian fly molecular interactions. "
negative,"Differentially methylated genomic fragments related with sexual dimorphism of rice pests, Sogatella furcifera. Sogatella furcifera (Hovarth) is a major rice pest with sexual dimorphism. The objective of the current research was to monitor differentially cytosine methylation at CCGG sequences in male and female adults of S. furcifera to determine the association between gene methylation and sexual phenotypes using methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis. After the second subtractive hybridization, four differentially methylated DNA bands were obtained and sequenced. Ten different fragments were found. One fragment from the positive hybridization was 120 bp, and highly similar to the tramtrack genes from Nasonia vitripennis. Another fragment from the reverse hybridization was 414 bp, and homologous to the 28S rRNA gene of S. furcifera with a similarity rate as high as 99%. We also discussed how DNA methylation of tramtrack and 28S rRNA genes produced effects on sexual differentiation and development. These results provide potential evidence that DNA methylation of some genes may be related to sexual phenotype variations in S. furcifera and will facilitate future studies on the epigenetic mechanisms of insect sexual dimorphism. "
negative,"An analysis of variability in genome organisation of intracellular calcium release channels across insect orders. Using publicly available genomic data, combined with RT-PCR validation, we explore structural genomic variation for two major ion channels across insect classes. We have manually curated ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) ORFs and their corresponding genomic structures from 26 different insects covering major insect orders. We found that, despite high protein identity for both RyRs (>75%) and IP3Rs (~67%), the overall complexity of the gene structure varies greatly between different insect orders with the simplest genes (fewest introns) found in Diptera and the most complex in Lepidoptera. Analysis of intron conservation patterns indicated that the majority of conserved introns are found close to the 5' end of the channels and in RyR around the highly conserved mutually exclusive splice site. Of the two channels the IP3Rs appear to have a less well conserved organisation with a greater overall number of unique introns seen between insect orders. We experimentally validated two of the manually curated ORFs for IP3Rs and confirmed an atypical (3799aa) IP3R receptor in Myzus persicae, which is approximately 1000 amino acids larger than previously reported for IP3Rs. "
negative,"Systematic screening of Anopheles mosquito genomes yields evidence for a major clade of Pao-like retrotransposons. We developed a degenerate PCR procedure to simultaneously amplify products from divergent retrotransposon families within the genomes of Anopheles mosquitoes. The procedure required cloning of multiple PCR products, but more than half of the clones subsequently sequenced were of retrotransposon origin. These included Copia-like and LINE retrotransposons, as well as the first Gypsy-like retrotransposons reported from mosquitoes. Furthermore, some Anopheles retrotransposon sequences showed similarity to the divergent Pao element from the silkmoth Bombyx mori. Phylogenetic analyses provided consistently strong bootstrap support (> 95%) for a major clade of Pao-like retrotransposons, which includes five mosquito sequences and the recently discovered Drosophila retrotransposons BEL and ninja. This appears to represent a new family of Pao-like LTR-retrotransposons distinct from the Copia and Gypsy families. "
negative,"Importance of genetic drift during Pleistocene divergence as revealed by analyses of genomic variation. Determining what factors affect the structuring of genetic variation is key to deciphering the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in species differentiation. Such information is especially critical to understanding how the frequent shifts and fragmentation of species distributions during the Pleistocene translates into species differences, and why the effect of such rapid climate change on patterns of species diversity varies among taxa. Studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have detected significant population structure in many species, including those directly impacted by the glacial cycles. Yet, understanding the ultimate consequence of such structure, as it relates to how species divergence occurs, requires demonstration that such patterns are also shared with genomic patterns of differentiation. Here we present analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the montane grasshopper Melanoplus oregonensis to assess the evolutionary significance of past demographic events and associated drift-induced divergence as inferred from mtDNA. As an inhabitant of the sky islands of the northern Rocky Mountains, this species was subject to repeated and frequent shifts in species distribution in response to the many glacial cycles. Nevertheless, significant genetic structuring of M. oregonensis is evident at two different geographic and temporal scales: recent divergence associated with the recolonization of the montane meadows in individual sky islands, as well as older divergence associated with displacements into regional glacial refugia. The genomic analyses indicate that drift-induced divergence, despite the lack of long-standing geographic barriers, has significantly contributed to species divergence during the Pleistocene. Moreover, the finding that divergence associated with past demographic events involves the repartitioning of ancestral variation without significant reductions of genomic diversity has intriguing implications - namely, the further amplification of drift-induced divergence by selection. "
negative,"Extensive synteny conservation of holocentric chromosomes in Lepidoptera despite high rates of local genome rearrangements. The recent assembly of the silkworm Bombyx mori genome with 432 Mb on 28 holocentric chromosomes has become a reference in the genomic analysis of the very diverse Order of Lepidoptera. We sequenced BACs from two major pests, the noctuid moths Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda, corresponding to 15 regions distributed on 11 B. mori chromosomes, each BAC / region being anchored by known orthologous gene(s) to analyze syntenic relationships and genome rearrangements among the three species. Nearly 300 genes and numerous transposable elements were identified, with long interspersed nuclear elements and terminal inverted repeats the most abundant transposable element classes. There was a high degree of synteny conservation between B. mori and the two noctuid species. Conserved syntenic blocks of identified genes were very small, however, approximately 1.3 genes per block between B. mori and the two noctuid species and 2.0 genes per block between S. frugiperda and H. armigera. This corresponds to approximately two chromosome breaks per Mb DNA per My. This is a much higher evolution rate than among species of the Drosophila genus and may be related to the holocentric nature of the lepidopteran genomes. We report a large cluster of eight members of the aminopeptidase N gene family that we estimate to have been present since the Jurassic. In contrast, several clusters of cytochrome P450 genes showed multiple lineage-specific duplication events, in particular in the lepidopteran CYP9A subfamily. Our study highlights the value of the silkworm genome as a reference in lepidopteran comparative genomics. "
positive,"Molecular characterization, expression analysis and RNAi knock-down of elongation factor 1α and 1γ from Nilaparvata lugens and its yeast-like symbiont. In the present paper, four cDNAs encoding the alpha and gamma subunits of elongation factor 1 (EF-1) were cloned and sequenced from Nilaparvata lugens, named NlEF-1α, NlEF-1γ, and its yeast-like symbiont (YLS), named YsEF-1α and YsEF-1γ, respectively. Comparisons with sequences from other species indicated a greater conservation for EF-1α than for EF-1γ. NlEF-1α has two identical copies. The deduced amino acid sequence homology of NlEF-1α and NlEF-1γ is 96 and 64%, respectively, compared with Homalodisca vitripennis and Locusta migratoria. The deduced amino acid sequence homology of YsEF-1α and YsEF-1γ is 96 and 74%, respectively, compared with Metarhizium anisopliae and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that the expression level of NlEF-1α and NlEF-1γ mRNA in hemolymph, ovary, fat body and salivary glands were higher than the midgut and leg tissue. YsEF-1α and YsEF-1γ was highly expressed in fat body. The expression level of NlEF-1α was higher than that of NlEF-1γ. Through RNA interference (RNAi) of the two genes, the mortality of nymph reached 92.2% at the 11th day after treatment and the ovarian development was severely hindered. The RT-qPCR analysis verified the correlation between mortality, sterility and the down-regulation of the target genes. The expression and synthesis of vitellogenin (Vg) protein in insects injected with NlEF-1α and NlEF-1γ double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was significantly lower than control groups. Attempts to knockdown the YsEF-1 genes in the YLS was unsuccessful. However, the phenotype of N. lugens injected with YsEF-1α dsRNA was the same as that injected with NlEF-1α dsRNA, possibly due to the high similarity (up to 71.9%) in the nucleotide sequences between NlEF-1α and YsEF-1α. We demonstrated that partial silencing of NlEF-1α and NlEF-1γ genes caused lethal and sterility effect on N. lugens. NlEF-1γ shares low identity with that of other insects and therefore it could be a potential target for RNAi-based pest management. "
positive,"Conserved promoter elements in the CYP6B gene family suggest common ancestry for cytochrome P450 monooxygenases mediating furanocoumarin detoxification. Despite the fact that Papilio glaucus and Papilio polyxenes share no single hostplant species, both species feed to varying extents on hostplants that contain furanocoumarins. P. glaucus contains two nearly identical genes, CYP6B4v2 and CYP6B5v1, and P. polyxenes contains two related genes, CYP6B1v3 and CYP6B3v2. Except for CYP6B3v2, the substrate specificity of which has not yet been defined, each of the encoded cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) metabolizes an array of linear furanocoumarins. All four genes are transcriptionally induced in larvae by exposure to the furanocoumarin xanthotoxin; several are also induced by other furanocoumarins. Comparisons of the organizational structures of these genes indicate that all have the same intron / exon arrangement. Sequences in the promoter regions of the P. glaucus CYP6B4v2 / CYP6B5v1 genes and the P. polyxenes CYP6B3v2 gene are similar but not identical to the -146 to -97 region of CYP6B1v3 gene, which contains a xanthotoxin-responsive element (XRE-xan) important for basal and xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of CYP6B1v3. Complements of the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE-AhR) in the dioxin-inducible human and rat CYP1A1 genes also exist in all four promoters, suggesting that these genes may be regulated by dioxin. Antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) in mouse and rat glutathione S-transferase genes and the Barbie box element (Bar) in the bacterial CYP102 gene exist in the CYP6B1v3, CYP6B4v2, and CYP6B5v1 promoters. Similarities in the protein sequences, intron positions, and xanthotoxin- and xenobiotic-responsive promoter elements indicate that these insect CYP6B genes are derived from a common ancestral gene. Evolutionary comparisons between these P450 genes are the first available for a group of insect genes transcriptionally regulated by hostplant allelochemicals and provide insights into the process by which insects evolve specialized feeding habits. "
positive,"CRISPR / Cas9-mediated knockout of both the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes confers high-level resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). Rapid evolution of resistance by insect pests severely jeopardizes the sustainable utilization of biopesticides and transgenic crops that produce insecticidal crystal proteins derived from the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Recently, high levels of resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins have been reported to be genetically linked to the mutation or down-regulation of ABC transporter subfamily C genes ABCC2 and ABCC3 in seven lepidopteran insects, including Plutella xylostella (L.). To further determine the causal relationship between alterations in the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes and Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella, the novel CRISPR / Cas9 genome engineering system was utilized to successfully construct two knockout strains: the ABCC2KO strain is homozygous for a 4-bp deletion in exon 3 of the PxABCC2 gene, and the ABCC3KO strain is homozygous for a 5-bp deletion in exon 3 of the PxABCC3 gene, both of which can produce only truncated ABCC proteins. Bioassay results indicated that high levels of resistance to the Cry1Ac protoxin were observed in both the ABCC2KO (724-fold) and ABCC3KO (413-fold) strains compared to the original susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. Subsequently, dominance degree and genetic complementation tests demonstrated that Cry1Ac resistance in both the knockout strains was incompletely recessive, and Cry1Ac resistance alleles were located in the classic BtR-1 resistance locus that harbored the PxABCC2 and PxABCC3 genes, similar to the near-isogenic resistant NIL-R strain. Moreover, qualitative toxin binding assays revealed that the binding of the Cry1Ac toxin to midgut brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) in both knockout strains was dramatically reduced compared to that in the susceptible DBM1Ac-S strain. In summary, our CRISPR / Cas9-mediated genome editing study presents, for the first time, in vivo reverse genetics evidence for both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins as midgut functional receptors for Bt Cry1 toxins in insects, which provides new insight into the pivotal roles of both the ABCC2 and ABCC3 proteins in the complex molecular mechanism of insect resistance to Bt Cry1 toxins. "
positive,"Identification of two piwi genes and their expression profile in honeybee, Apis mellifera. Piwi genes play an important role in regulating spermatogenesis and oogenesis because they participate in the biogenesis of piRNAs, a new class of noncoding RNAs. However, these genes are not well understood in most insects. To understand the function of piwi genes in honeybee reproduction, we amplified two full-length piwi-like genes, Am-aub and Am-ago3. Both the cloned Am-aub and Am-ago3 genes contained typical PAZ and PIWI domains and active catalytic motifs ""Asp-Asp-Asp / His / Glu / Lys,"" suggesting that the two piwi-like genes possessed slicer activity. We examined the expression levels of Am-aub and Am-ago3 in workers, queens, drones, and female larvae by quantitative PCR. Am-aub was more abundant than Am-ago3 in all the tested samples. Both Am-aub and Am-ago3 were highly expressed in drones but not in workers and queens. The significant finding was that the larval food stream influenced the expression of Piwi genes in adult honeybees. This helps to understand the nutritional control of reproductive status in honeybees at the molecular level. "
negative,"Immunogenicity of virus-like particles containing modified goose parvovirus VP2 protein. The major capsid protein VP2 of goose parvovirus (GPV) expressed using a baculovirus expression system (BES) assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). To optimize VP2 gene expression in Sf9 cells, we converted wild-type VP2 (VP2) codons into codons that are more common in insect genes. This change greatly increased VP2 protein production in Sf9 cells. The protein generated from the codon-optimized VP2 (optVP2) was detected by immunoblotting and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the formation of VLPs. These findings indicate that optVP2 yielded stable and high-quality VLPs. Immunogenicity assays revealed that the VLPs are highly immunogenic, elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge. The antibody levels appeared to be directly related to the number of GP-Ag-positive hepatocytes. The variation trends for GP-Ag-positive hepatocytes were similar in the vaccine groups. In comparison with the control group, the optVP2 VLPs groups exhibited obviously better responses. These data indicate that the VLPs retained immunoreactivity and had strong immunogenicity in susceptible geese. Thus, GPV optVP2 appears to be a good candidate for the vaccination of goslings. "
negative,"Analysis of repetitive DNA distribution patterns in the Tribolium castaneum genome. BACKGROUND: Insect genomes vary widely in size, a large fraction of which is often devoted to repetitive DNA. Re-association kinetics indicate that up to 42% of the genome of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is repetitive. Analysis of the abundance and distribution of repetitive DNA in the recently sequenced genome of T. castaneum is important for understanding the structure and function of its genome. RESULTS: Using TRF, TEpipe and RepeatScout we found that approximately 30% of the T. castaneum assembled genome is composed of repetitive DNA. Of this, 17% is found in tandem arrays and the remaining 83% is dispersed, including transposable elements, which in themselves constitute 5-6% of the genome. RepeatScout identified 31 highly repetitive DNA elements with repeat units longer than 100 bp, which constitute 7% of the genome; 65% of these highly repetitive elements and 74% of transposable elements accumulate in regions representing 40% of the assembled genome that is anchored to chromosomes. These regions tend to occur near one end of each chromosome, similar to previously described blocks of pericentric heterochromatin. They contain fewer genes with longer introns, and often correspond with regions of low recombination in the genetic map. CONCLUSION: Our study found that transposable elements and other repetitive DNA accumulate in certain regions in the assembled T. castaneum genome. Several lines of evidence suggest these regions are derived from the large blocks of pericentric heterochromatin in T. castaneum chromosomes. "
negative,"Genomic insight into the amino acid relations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, with its symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. The pea aphid genome includes 66 genes contributing to amino acid biosynthesis and 93 genes to amino acid degradation. In several respects, the pea aphid gene inventory complements that of its symbiotic bacterium, Buchnera aphidicola (Buchnera APS). Unlike other insects with completely sequenced genomes, the pea aphid lacks the capacity to synthesize arginine, which is produced by Buchnera APS. However, consistent with other insects, it has genes coding for individual reactions in essential amino acid biosynthesis, including threonine dehydratase and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, which are not coded in the Buchnera APS genome. Overall the genome data suggest that the biosynthesis of certain essential amino acids is shared between the pea aphid and Buchnera APS, providing the opportunity for precise aphid control over Buchnera metabolism. "
negative,"Towards an understanding of the molecular basis of effective RNAi against a global insect pest, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. In planta RNAi against essential insect genes offers a promising route to control insect crop pests, but is constrained for many insect groups, notably phloem sap-feeding hemipterans, by poor RNAi efficacy. This study conducted on the phloem-feeding whitefly Bemisia tabaci reared on tomato plants investigated the causes of low RNAi efficacy and routes to ameliorate the problem. Experiments using tomato transgenic lines containing ds-GFP (green fluorescent protein) revealed that full-length dsRNA is phloem-mobile, ingested by the insects, and degraded in the insect. We identified B. tabaci homologs of nuclease genes (dsRNases) in other insects that degrade dsRNA, and demonstrated that degradation of ds-GFP in B. tabaci is suppressed by administration of dsRNA against these genes. dsRNA against the nuclease genes was co-administered with dsRNA against two insect genes, an aquaporin AQP1 and sucrase SUC1, that are predicted to protect B. tabaci against osmotic collapse. When dsRNA constructs for AQP1, SUC1, dsRNase1 and dsRNase2 were stacked, insect mortality was significantly elevated to 50% over 6 days on artificial diets. This effect was accompanied by significant reduction in gene expression of the target genes in surviving diet-fed insects. This study offers proof-of-principle that the efficacy of RNAi against insect pests can be enhanced by using dsRNA to suppress the activity of RNAi-suppressing nuclease genes, especially where multiple genes with related physiological function but different molecular function are targeted. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of a retroelement from B chromosome (PSR) in the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Molecular characterization of the paternal-sex-ratio (PSR) chromosome in Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) has led to the isolation of a dispersed repetitive element. The element is a LTR-containing retrotransposon which has been named NATE (NAsonia Transposable Element). NATE has direct terminal repeats and has an internal amino acid sequence similar to reverse transcriptases of other retroelements. Phylogenetic analysis indicates NATE is a member of the Gypsy / Ty3 group of retrotransposons, and represents the first isolated from Hymenoptera. Five closely related copies of NATE were isolated from the PSR chromosome, but cross-hybridizing elements were not detected on the autosomes of N. vitripennis. Strongly cross-hybridizing elements were, however, detected in two other Nasonia species. This observed distribution of NATE is interesting, because the supernumerary PSR chromosome may be derived from the genome of a sibling species of N. vitripennis. "
negative,"The Aedes aegypti genome: a comparative perspective. The sequencing of the second mosquito genome, Aedes aegypti, in addition to Anopheles gambiae, is a major milestone that will drive molecular-level and genome-wide high-throughput studies of not only these but also other mosquito vectors of human pathogens. Here we overview the ancestry of the mosquito genes, list the major expansions of gene families that may relate to species adaptation processes, as exemplified by CYP9 cytochrome P450 genes, and discuss the conservation of chromosomal gene arrangements among the two mosquitoes and fruit fly. Many more invertebrate genomes are expected to be sequenced in the near future, including additional vectors of human pathogens (see http: /  / www.vectorbase.org), and further comparative analyses will become increasingly refined and informative, hopefully improving our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypical differences among these species, their vectorial capacity, and ultimately leading to the development of novel disease control strategies. "
negative,"Molecular evolutionary trends and feeding ecology diversification in the Hemiptera, anchored by the milkweed bug genome. BACKGROUND: The Hemiptera (aphids, cicadas, and true bugs) are a key insect order, with high diversity for feeding ecology and excellent experimental tractability for molecular genetics. Building upon recent sequencing of hemipteran pests such as phloem-feeding aphids and blood-feeding bed bugs, we present the genome sequence and comparative analyses centered on the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, a seed feeder of the family Lygaeidae. RESULTS: The 926-Mb Oncopeltus genome is well represented by the current assembly and official gene set. We use our genomic and RNA-seq data not only to characterize the protein-coding gene repertoire and perform isoform-specific RNAi, but also to elucidate patterns of molecular evolution and physiology. We find ongoing, lineage-specific expansion and diversification of repressive C2H2 zinc finger proteins. The discovery of intron gain and turnover specific to the Hemiptera also prompted the evaluation of lineage and genome size as predictors of gene structure evolution. Furthermore, we identify enzymatic gains and losses that correlate with feeding biology, particularly for reductions associated with derived, fluid nutrition feeding. CONCLUSIONS: With the milkweed bug, we now have a critical mass of sequenced species for a hemimetabolous insect order and close outgroup to the Holometabola, substantially improving the diversity of insect genomics. We thereby define commonalities among the Hemiptera and delve into how hemipteran genomes reflect distinct feeding ecologies. Given Oncopeltus's strength as an experimental model, these new sequence resources bolster the foundation for molecular research and highlight technical considerations for the analysis of medium-sized invertebrate genomes. "
positive,"BmCAP, a silkmoth gene encoding multiple protein isoforms characterized by SoHo and SH3 domains: expression analysis during ovarian follicular development. CAP / ArgBP2 / vinexin family proteins, adaptor proteins characterized by three SH3 domains at their C-termini and a SoHo domain towards their N-termini, are known to regulate cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and growth factor signaling. Here we present the isolation and ovarian expression of the BmCAP gene which encodes CAP / ArgBP2 / vinexin family proteins in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori. Screening for full-length cDNA clones identified three mRNA isoforms, BmCAP-A1, BmCAP-A2 and BmCAP-B, which show expression throughout ovarian follicular development. Using an antibody raised against a unique region between the SoHo and SH3 domains, BmCAP-A protein isoforms were identified that show specific expression in different compartments of the ovarian follicles. Immunofluorescence staining of the cells of the follicular epithelium establishes a dynamic pattern of BmCAP-A protein localization during choriogenesis. During early choriogenesis, BmCAP-A has a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm but could also be found concentrated at the apical and basal sides at the cell-cell junctions. During late choriogenesis, the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of BmCAP-A disappears while the staining pattern at the apical side resembles a blueprint for the eggshell surface structure. We suggest that BmCAP-A isoforms have important functions during ovarian development, which involve not only the traditional roles in actin organization or cell-cell adhesion but also the regulation of secretion of chorion proteins and the sculpting of the chorion surface. "
positive,"Changes in the expression of four ABC transporter genes in response to imidacloprid in Bemisia tabaci Q (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a globally invasive species complex that causes serious damage to field crops, has developed resistance to imidacloprid and many other pesticides. Insect detoxify to pesticides may partially depend on ABC transporters, which contribute to the detoxification of xenobiotics. To determine whether genes in the ABCG subfamily are involved in imidacloprid detoxification in B. tabaci Q, we cloned four ABCG subfamily genes based on the published MED / Q genome and on our previous study of the transcriptional response of ABC transporters in B. tabaci Q adults to imidacloprid. As indicated by the quantification of mRNA levels after a 6-h exposure, the expression level of ABCG3 was 3.3-fold higher in B. tabaci Q adults exposed to 100 μg / mL imidacloprid rather than to the buffer control. The expression level of ABCG3 was higher in females than in males but did not significantly differ among eggs or nymphal stages and did not significantly differ among head, thorax, and abdomen tissues of adults. Knockdown of ABCG3 via RNA interference significantly increased the mortality of imidacloprid-treated laboratory and field-collected adults of B. tabaci Q. These results indicate that the ABCG3 gene may be involved in imidacloprid detoxification by B. tabaci Q. "
negative,"Signatures of DNA Methylation across Insects Suggest Reduced DNA Methylation Levels in Holometabola. It has been experimentally shown that DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression and the silencing of transposable element activity in eukaryotes. The variable levels of DNA methylation among different insect species indicate an evolutionarily flexible role of DNA methylation in insects, which due to a lack of comparative data is not yet well-substantiated. Here, we use computational methods to trace signatures of DNA methylation across insects by analyzing transcriptomic and genomic sequence data from all currently recognized insect orders. We conclude that: 1) a functional methylation system relying exclusively on DNA methyltransferase 1 is widespread across insects. 2) DNA methylation has potentially been lost or extremely reduced in species belonging to springtails (Collembola), flies and relatives (Diptera), and twisted-winged parasites (Strepsiptera). 3) Holometabolous insects display signs of reduced DNA methylation levels in protein-coding sequences compared with hemimetabolous insects. 4) Evolutionarily conserved insect genes associated with housekeeping functions tend to display signs of heavier DNA methylation in comparison to the genomic / transcriptomic background. With this comparative study, we provide the much needed basis for experimental and detailed comparative analyses required to gain a deeper understanding on the evolution and function of DNA methylation in insects. "
positive,"Functional specialization among insect chitinase family genes revealed by RNA interference. The biological functions of individual members of the large family of chitinase-like proteins from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tc), were examined by using gene-specific RNAi. One chitinase, TcCHT5, was found to be required for pupal-adult molting only. A lethal phenotype was observed when the transcript level of TcCHT5 was down-regulated by injection of TcCHT5-specific dsRNA into larvae. The larvae had metamorphosed into pupae and then to pharate adults but did not complete adult eclosion. Specific knockdown of transcripts for another chitinase, TcCHT10, which has multiple catalytic domains, prevented embryo hatch, larval molting, pupation, and adult metamorphosis, indicating a vital role for TcCHT10 during each of these processes. A third chitinase-like protein, TcCHT7, was required for abdominal contraction and wing / elytra extension immediately after pupation but was dispensable for larval-larval molting, pupation, and adult eclosion. The wing / elytra abnormalities found in TcCHT7-silenced pupae were also manifest in the ensuing adults. A fourth chitinase-like protein, TcIDGF4, exhibited no chitinolytic activity but contributed to adult eclosion. No phenotypic effects were observed after knockdown of transcripts for several other chitinase-like proteins, including imaginal disk growth factor IDGF2. These data indicate functional specialization among insect chitinase family genes, primarily during the molting process, and provide a biological rationale for the presence of a large assortment of chitinase-like proteins. "
negative,"hycu-hr6, A large homologous region of the Hyphantria cunea nucleopolyhedrovirus genome, as a powerful and versatile enhancer in insect expression systems. We previously identified a large homologous region (hr), hycu-hr6, in the genome of the Hyphantria cunea nucleopolyhedrovirus (HycuNPV) and suggested that hycu-hr6 was the largest baculovirus promoter enhancer hr identified so far. In this study, we examined the enhancement activity of hycu-hr6 against two promoters from constitutive baculovirus immediate early genes, the HycuNPV ie1 (hycu-ie1) and the Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid (M) NPV ie2 (op-ie2), and against a promoter from the inducible Drosophila heat shock protein 70 gene (hsp70) in five lepidopteran (BmN-4, Ld652Y, Sf9, SpIm, and TN368) and one dipteran (S2) insect cell lines. Comparative analyses of transient expression assays using the firefly luciferase gene (luc) as a reporter showed that hycu-hr6 enhanced the activity of all three promoters in all tested cell lines. Comparison of the enhancement efficiency of hycu-hr6 with that of Autographa californica MNPV (AcMNPV) hr5, an enhancer commonly used to improve the activity of AcMNPV ie1 promoter in many insect expression vectors, established that hycu-hr6 was a more efficient enhancer. These results indicate that hycu-hr6 is a versatile and superior promoter enhancer in several insect cell lines and favor the incorporation of hycu-hr6 into insect expression vectors to maximize promoter activity. "
positive,"Insecticides induce the co-expression of glutathione S-transferases through ROS / CncC pathway in Spodoptera exigua. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional enzymes that are involved in detoxification of electrophilic toxic compounds. Although the co-induced expression of GST genes by insecticides in insects has been documented in recent years, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not understood. In this study, a total of thirty-one cytosolic S. exigua GSTs (SeGSTs) was cloned and identified. The bioinformatics and gene expression patterns were also analyzed. Out of them, SeGSTe9, SeGSTs6, SeGSTe1, SeGSTe6, SeGSTe8, SeGSTe14, and SeGSTd1 were significantly co-expressed following exposure to three insecticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos and chlorantraniliprole). The analysis of upstream sequences revealed that all of these seven SeGSTs harbored CncC / Maf binding site. The luciferase reporter assay showed that the pGL3-SeGST promoter construct exhibited a significant increase in luciferase activities after exposure to insecticides, and mutation of CncC / Maf binding site diminish the induction effect. These data indicate that CncC / Maf pathway regulates the co-expression of GST genes in response to different insecticides in S. exigua. Insecticides significantly enhanced the ROS content and treatment with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased the insecticide-induced luciferase activities of the PGL3-GSTe6 promoter construct, but not the CncC-mutated construct. These results indicate that ROS mediates GST gene expression after exposure to insecticides through CncC / Maf pathway. Overall, these data show that insecticides induce the co-expression of glutathione S-transferases through the ROS / CncC pathway in S. exigua. "
negative,"Direct estimation of per nucleotide and genomic deleterious mutation rates in Drosophila. Spontaneous mutations are the source of genetic variation required for evolutionary change, and are therefore important for many aspects of evolutionary biology. For example, the divergence between taxa at neutrally evolving sites in the genome is proportional to the per nucleotide mutation rate, u (ref. 1), and this can be used to date speciation events by assuming a molecular clock. The overall rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations in the genome each generation (U) appears in theories of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism, the evolution of sex and recombination, and the evolutionary consequences of inbreeding. However, estimates of U based on changes in allozymes or DNA sequences and fitness traits are discordant. Here we directly estimate u in Drosophila melanogaster by scanning 20 million bases of DNA from three sets of mutation accumulation lines by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. From 37 mutation events that we detected, we obtained a mean estimate for u of 8.4 x 10(-9) per generation. Moreover, we detected significant heterogeneity in u among the three mutation-accumulation-line genotypes. By multiplying u by an estimate of the fraction of mutations that are deleterious in natural populations of Drosophila, we estimate that U is 1.2 per diploid genome. This high rate suggests that selection against deleterious mutations may have a key role in explaining patterns of genetic variation in the genome, and help to maintain recombination and sexual reproduction. "
negative,"The intracellular sRNA transcriptome of Listeria monocytogenes during growth in macrophages. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are widespread effectors of post-transcriptional gene regulation in bacteria. Currently extensive information exists on the sRNAs of Listeria monocytogenes expressed during growth in extracellular environments. We used deep sequencing of cDNAs obtained from fractioned RNA (<500 nt) isolated from extracellularly growing bacteria and from L. monocytogenes infected macrophages to catalog the sRNA repertoire during intracellular bacterial growth. Here, we report on the discovery of 150 putative regulatory RNAs of which 71 have not been previously described. A total of 29 regulatory RNAs, including small non-coding antisense RNAs, are specifically expressed intracellularly. We validated highly expressed sRNAs by northern blotting and demonstrated by the construction and characterization of isogenic mutants of rli31, rli33-1 and rli50* for intracellular expressed sRNA candidates, that their expression is required for efficient growth of bacteria in macrophages. All three mutants were attenuated when assessed for growth in mouse and insect models of infection. Comparative genomic analysis revealed the presence of lineage specific sRNA candidates and the absence of sRNA loci in genomes of naturally occurring infection-attenuated bacteria, with additional loss in non-pathogenic listerial genomes. Our analyses reveal extensive sRNA expression as an important feature of bacterial regulation during intracellular growth. "
positive,"Molecular characterization of prophenoloxidase-1 (PPO1) and the inhibitory effect of kojic acid on phenoloxidase (PO) activity and on the development of Zeugodacus tau (Walker) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Phenoloxidase (PO) plays a key role in melanin biosynthesis during insect development. Here, we isolated the 2310-bp full-length cDNA of PPO1 from Zeugodacus tau, a destructive horticultural pest. qRT-polymerase chain reaction showed that the ZtPPO1 transcripts were highly expressed during larval-prepupal transition and in the haemolymph. When the larvae were fed a 1.66% kojic acid (KA)-containing diet, the levels of the ZtPPO1 transcripts significantly increased by 2.79- and 3.39-fold in the whole larvae and cuticles, respectively, while the corresponding PO activity was significantly reduced; in addition, the larval and pupal durations were significantly prolonged; pupal weights were lowered; and abnormal phenotypes were observed. An in vitro inhibition experiment indicated that KA was an effective competitive inhibitor of PO in Z. tau. Additionally, the functional analysis showed that 20E could significantly up-regulate the expression of ZtPPO1, induce lower pupal weight, and advance pupation. Knockdown of the ZtPPO1 gene by RNAi significantly decreased mRNA levels after 24 h and led to low pupation rates and incomplete pupae with abnormal phenotypes during the larval-pupal interim period. These results proved that PO is important for the normal growth of Z. tau and that KA can disrupt the development of this pest insect. "
negative,"Genetics and physiology of Varroa mites. Varroa destructor is the primary biological threat to domesticated honey bee colonies in much of the world, impacting host fitness both directly and by transmitting RNA viruses. Genomic, proteomic, and functional-genetic resources provide a framework for Varroa biology. When coupled with physiological analyses of development, host finding, and reproduction, these resources reveal general traits of arthropods and offer new strategies for mite control. Efforts to develop novel controls are focused on efficacy, efficient delivery, and the avoidance of both host impacts and the swift evolution of resistance by mites. "
negative,"Progress and challenges in identifying molecular mechanisms underlying host and vector manipulation by plant viruses. Plant virus infection fundamentally alters chemical and behavioral phenotypes of hosts and vectors. These alterations often enhance virus transmission, leading researchers to surmise that such effects are manipulations caused by virus adaptations and not just by-products of pathology. But identification of the virus components behind manipulation is missing from most studies performed to date. Here, we evaluate causative empirical evidence that virus components are the drivers of manipulated host and vector phenotypes. To do so, we link findings and methodologies on virus pathology with observational and functional genomics studies on virus manipulation. Our synthesis provides an overview of progress, areas of synergy, and new approaches that will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of host and vector manipulation by plant viruses. "
negative,"Segmental duplications in the silkworm genome. BACKGROUND: Segmental duplications (SDs) or low-copy repeats play important roles in both gene and genome evolution. SDs have been extensively investigated in many organisms, however, there is no information about SDs in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. RESULT: In this study, we identified and annotated the SDs in the silkworm genome. Our results suggested that SDs constitute ~1.4% of the silkworm genome sequence (≥1 kb in length and ≥90% in the identity of sequence); the number is similar to that in Drosophila melanogaster but smaller than mammalian organisms. Almost half (42%) of the SD sequences are not assigned to chromosomes, indicating that the SDs are challenges for the assembling of genome sequences. We also provided experimental validation of large duplications using qPCR. The analysis of SD content indicated that the genes related to immunity, detoxification, reproduction, and environmental signal recognition are significantly enriched in the silkworm SDs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that segmental duplications have been problematic for sequencing and assembling of the silkworm genome. SDs may have important biological significances in immunity, detoxification, reproduction, and environmental signal recognition in the silkworm. This study provides insight into the evolution of the silkworm genome and an invaluable resource for insect genomics research. "
positive,"RNA interference-mediated knockdown of eye coloration genes in the western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus Knight). Insect eye coloration arises from the accumulation of various pigments. A number of genes that function in the biosynthesis (vermilion, cinnabar, and cardinal) and importation (karmoisin, white, scarlet, and brown) of these pigments, and their precursors, have been identified in diverse species and used as markers for transgenesis and gene editing. To examine their suitability as visible markers in Lygus hesperus Knight (western tarnished plant bug), transcriptomic data were screened for sequences exhibiting homology with the Drosophila melanogaster proteins. Complete open reading frames encoding putative homologs for all seven genes were identified. Bioinformatic-based sequence and phylogenetic analyses supported initial annotations as eye coloration genes. Consistent with their proposed role, each of the genes was expressed in adult heads as well as throughout nymphal and adult development. Adult eyes of those injected with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) for karmoisin, vermilion, cinnabar, cardinal, and scarlet were characterized by a red band along the medial margin extending from the rostral terminus to the antenna. In contrast, eyes of insects injected with dsRNAs for both white and brown were a uniform light brown. White knockdown also produced cuticular and behavioral defects. Based on its expression profile and robust visible phenotype, cardinal would likely prove to be the most suitable marker for developing gene editing methods in Lygus species. "
negative,"Derived esterase activity in Drosophila sechellia contributes to evolved octanoic acid resistance. The dietary specialist fruit fly Drosophila sechellia has evolved resistance to the secondary defence compounds produced by the fruit of its host plant, Morinda citrifolia. The primary chemicals that contribute to lethality of M. citrifolia are the medium-chain fatty acids octanoic acid (OA) and hexanoic acid. At least five genomic regions contribute to this adaptation in D. sechellia and whereas the fine-mapped major effect locus for OA resistance on chromosome 3R has been thoroughly analysed, the remaining four genomic regions that contribute to toxin resistance remain uncharacterized. To begin to identify the genetic basis of toxin resistance in this species, we removed the function of well-known detoxification gene families to determine whether they contribute to toxin resistance. Previous work found that evolution of cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity or expression is not responsible for the OA resistance in D. sechellia. Here, we tested the role of the two other major detoxification gene families in resistance to Morinda fruit toxins - glutathione-S-transferases and esterases - through the use of the pesticide synergists diethyl maleate and tribufos that inhibit the function of these gene families. This work suggests that one or more esterase(s) contribute to evolved OA resistance in D. sechellia. "
negative,"Genomic structure of the luciferase gene from the bioluminescent beetle, Nyctophila cf. caucasica. The gene coding for beetle luciferase, the enzyme responsible for bioluminescence in over two thousand coleopteran species has, to date, only been characterized from one Palearctic species of Lampyridae. Here we report the characterization of the luciferase gene from a female beetle of an Iranian lampyrid species, Nyctophila cf. caucasica (Coleoptera:Lampyridae). The luciferase gene was composed of seven exons, coding for 547 amino acids, separated by six introns spanning 1976 bp of genomic DNA. The deduced amino acid sequences of the luciferase gene of N. caucasica showed 98.9% homology to that of the Palearctic species Lampyris noctiluca. Analysis of the 810 bp upstream region of the luciferase gene revealed three TATA boxes and several other consensus transcriptional factor recognition sequences presenting evidence for a putative core promoter region conserved in Lampyrinae from -190 through to -155 upstream of the luciferase start codon. Along with the core promoter region the luciferase gene was compared with orthologous sequences from other lampyrid species and found to have greatest identity to Lampyris turkistanicus and Lampyris noctiluca. The significant sequence identity to the former is discussed in relation to taxonomic issues of Iranian lampyrids. "
negative,"Nuclear receptors of the honey bee: annotation and expression in the adult brain. The Drosophila genome encodes 18 canonical nuclear receptors. All of the Drosophila nuclear receptors are here shown to be present in the genome of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Given that the time since divergence of the Drosophila and Apis lineages is measured in hundreds of millions of years, the identification of matched orthologous nuclear receptors in the two genomes reveals the fundamental set of nuclear receptors required to 'make' an endopterygote insect. The single novelty is the presence in the A. mellifera genome of a third insect gene similar to vertebrate photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (PNR). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this novel gene, which we have named AmPNR-like, is a new member of the NR2 subfamily not found in the Drosophila or human genomes. This gene is expressed in the developing compound eye of the honey bee. Like their vertebrate counterparts, arthropod nuclear receptors play key roles in embryonic and postembryonic development. Studies in Drosophila have focused primarily on the role of these transcription factors in embryogenesis and metamorphosis. Examination of an expressed sequence tag library developed from the adult bee brain and analysis of transcript expression in brain using in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that several members of the nuclear receptor family (AmSVP, AmUSP, AmERR, AmHr46, AmFtz-F1, and AmHnf-4) are expressed in the brain of the adult bee. Further analysis of the expression of AmUSP and AmSVP in the mushroom bodies, the major insect brain centre for learning and memory, revealed changes in transcript abundance and, in the case of AmUSP, changes in transcript localization, during the development of foraging behaviour in the adult. Study of the honey bee therefore provides a model for understanding nuclear receptor function in the adult brain. "
negative,"Nuclear receptors in Bombyx mori: insights into genomic structure and developmental expression. Nuclear receptors (NRs) function as ligand-dependent transcription factors and are involved in diverse biological processes in different animals. The updated assembly of complete genome sequence of the Bombyx mori enabled a systematic analysis of the NRs in the five holometabolous insects including B. mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Tribolium castaneum. As a result, nineteen NRs were identified in the B. mori genome, each of eighteen NRs has 1:1:1:1 ortholog in the other four insects. Interestingly, the average intron number of ligand-binding domain (LBD) of each NR gene in B. mori was 2.4, much higher than that in the other four insects; the genomic position of introns in LBDs of all orthologs for each NR presents more diversity. Phylogenetic trees of all NRs from the five insects were consistent or aberrant with classical phylogeny of these insect species. The characteristics in number, genomic structure and phylogeny of all NRs revealed their evolutionary conservation and divergence during insect evolution. The expression patterns of several NR genes displayed temporal specificity similar to that in D. melanogaster and may be associated with the key biological processes during silkworm metamorphosis. The RNAi of BmbetaFTZ-F1 resulted in abnormality in larva-pupa transition, further suggesting it is also crucial for silkworm metamorphosis. In conclusion, the present study provided new insights into the structure, evolution, expression, and functions of silkworm NRs. "
negative,"Development of soybean aphid genomic SSR markers using next generation sequencing. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites are very useful molecular markers, owing to their locus-specific codominant and multiallelic nature, high abundance in the genome, and high rates of transferability across species. The soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) has become the most damaging insect pest of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in North America, since it was first found in the Midwest of the United States in 2000. Biotypes of the soybean aphid capable of colonizing newly developed aphid-resistant soybean cultivars have been recently discovered. Genetic resources, including molecular markers, to study soybean aphids are severely lacking. Recently developed next generation sequencing platforms offer opportunities for high-throughput and inexpensive genome sequencing and rapid marker development. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop and characterize genomic SSR markers from soybean aphid genomic sequences generated by next generation sequencing technology and (ii) to evaluate the utility of the SSRs for genetic diversity or relationship analyses. In total 128 SSR primer pairs were designed from sequences generated by Illumina GAII from a reduced representation library of A. glycines. Nearly 94% (120) of the primer pairs amplified SSR alleles of expected size and 24 SSR loci were polymorphic among three aphid samples from three populations. The polymorphic SSRs were successfully used to differentiate among 24 soybean aphids from Ohio and South Dakota. Sequencing of PCR products of two SSR markers from four aphid samples revealed that the allelic polymorphism was due to variation in the SSR repeats among the aphids. These markers should be particularly useful for genetic differentiation among aphids collected from soybean fields at different localities and regions. These SSR markers provide the soybean aphid research community with the first set of PCR-based codominant markers developed from the genomic sequences of A. glycines. "
negative,"Molecular cloning, genomic structure, and genetic mapping of two Rdl-orthologous genes of GABA receptors in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) gene encodes a subunit of the insect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. Cyclodiene resistance in many insects is associated with replacement of a single amino acid (alanine at position 302) with either a serine or a glycine in the Rdl gene. Two Rdl-orthologous genes of GABA receptors (PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2) were cloned and sequenced from a susceptible strain (Roth) of Plutella xylostella. PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 showed 84% and 77% identity with the Rdl gene of Drosophila melanogaster at an amino acid level, respectively. The coding regions of PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 both comprise ten exons, with two alternative RNA-splicing forms in exon 3 of both genes. At the orthologous position of alanine-302 in D. melanogaster Rdl, PxGABARalpha1 has a conserved alanine at position 282. PxGABARalpha2 has a serine instead of an alanine at the equivalent position. With two informative DNA markers, both PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 were mapped onto the Z chromosome of P. xylostella. "
negative,"How interactions with plant chemicals shape insect genomes. The transition to herbivory by insects is associated with distinct genomic signatures. Sequenced genomes of extant herbivore species reveal the result of these transitions, but in lieu of comparisons between herbivorous and non-herbivorous lineages that diverged recently, such datasets have shed less light on the evolutionary genomic processes involved in diet shifts to or from herbivory. Here, we propose that the comparative genomics of diet shifts between closely related insect herbivores and non-herbivores, and within densely-sampled clades of herbivores, will help reveal the extent to which herbivory evolves through the co-option and subtle remodeling of widely-conserved gene families with functions ancestrally distinct from phytophagy. "
positive,"Molecular characterization of heat shock protein 90, 70 and 70 cognate cDNAs and their expression patterns during thermal stress and pupal diapause in the corn earworm. Three heat shock protein transcripts, hsp90, hsp70, hsc70, isolated from the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea, were evaluated for their responsiveness to diapause and thermal stress. These Hsps showed high homology to their counterparts in other species. A phylogenetic analysis of the Hsp90 sequence was consistent with the known classification of insects. Northern blot hybridization indicated the presence of hsp90 transcripts in all tissues, but expression in the brain-subesophageal complex was especially pronounced. The genomic organization of hsp90 examined by Southern blot suggested the presence of a single copy of hsp90 in the H. zea genome. The expression patterns after heat shock indicated that hsp70 and hsp90 were heat-inducible, although hsp70 was more strongly induced than hsp90, and hsc70 was indeed a constitutively expressed member of the hsp70 family. Expression of hsp70 and hsc70 were not altered by the diapause program, but hsp90 was down-regulated at this time. Low temperatures (0-4 degrees C) and recovery from low temperature elicited hsp70 and hsp90 responses, but not an hsc70 response. Thus, unlike several other species, H. zea does not up-regulate hsp70 during pupal diapause, but the down-regulation of hsp90 is consistent with the pattern observed in several other species during diapause. Our results also indicate that hsp90 and hsp70 are responsive to low temperature in both diapausing and nondiapausing pupae. "
negative,"Cyanogenic glucosides in the biological warfare between plants and insects: the Burnet moth-Birdsfoot trefoil model system. Cyanogenic glucosides are important components of plant defense against generalist herbivores due to their bitter taste and the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide upon tissue disruption. Some specialized herbivores, especially insects, preferentially feed on cyanogenic plants. Such herbivores have acquired the ability to metabolize cyanogenic glucosides or to sequester them for use in their own predator defense. Burnet moths (Zygaena) sequester the cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin from their food plants (Fabaceae) and, in parallel, are able to carry out de novo synthesis of the very same compounds. The ratio and content of cyanogenic glucosides is tightly regulated in the different stages of the Zygaena filipendulae lifecycle and the compounds play several important roles in addition to defense. The transfer of a nuptial gift of cyanogenic glucosides during mating of Zygaena has been demonstrated as well as the possible involvement of hydrogen cyanide in male assessment and nitrogen metabolism. As the capacity to de novo synthesize cyanogenic glucosides was developed independently in plants and insects, the great similarities of the pathways between the two kingdoms indicate that cyanogenic glucosides are produced according to a universal route providing recruitment of the enzymes required. Pyrosequencing of Z. filipendulae larvae de novo synthesizing cyanogenic glucosides served to provide a set of good candidate genes, and demonstrated that the genes encoding the pathway in plants and Z. filipendulae are not closely related phylogenetically. Identification of insect genes involved in the biosynthesis and turn-over of cyanogenic glucosides will provide new insights into biological warfare as a determinant of co-evolution between plants and insects. "
positive,"Characterization of antennal chemosensilla and associated odorant binding as well as chemosensory proteins in the Eupeodes corollae (Diptera: Syrphidae). Aphidophagous syrphids are important for pest control and pollination in various agroecosystems. However, the mechanism underlying olfaction, which is critical for insect' behavioral processes and fitness, has not been well understood in the family Syrphidae. Hence, we performed a systematic identification and characterisation of the antennal sensilla and two groups of soluble proteins, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs), in the hoverfly Eupeodes corollae. (i) With scanning electron microscopy, four major types of sensilla (chaetic sensilla [two subtypes], trichoid sensilla, basiconic sensilla [two subtypes] and coeloconic sensilla), with numerous microtrichia, were first observed along the entire surface of aristate antennae of both sexes of E. corollae. Of these, only chaetic sensillum was found on the first two antennal segments, scape and pedicel, while the other types of sensilla were located on the flagellum. No marked difference was observed in the morphological structure or distributional pattern of any of the sensilla between the two sexes. (ii) By molecular cloning and bioinformatic analysis, 7 EcorCSPs and 28 EcorOBPs (20 classic OBPs, 5 minus-C OBPs, and 3 plus-C OBPs) were directly identified from the species, which all share the characteristic hallmarks of their family, including the presence of a signal peptide and conserved cysteine signature. (iii) RT-qPCR of these chemosensory genes showed predominately tissue-biased expression patterns; 32 of the 35 EcorOBPs / CSPs were uniquely or primarily expressed in the main olfactory organs, either the antennae or head. (iv) Among these, several genes (EcorCSP2 and EcorOBP1, 9, 12, 15-17, 20) appeared to be antenna-biased. In situ hybridization assays indicated that each antenna-biased chemosensory gene was expressed in a different number of cells, suggesting they might play a more vital role in odour recognition and perception and could be potential candidates to study their biological functions in vivo and in vitro. Together, our current findings provide a basis for future studies on how syrphids utilize chemical cues to regulate their behavior during interactions among the natural enemy, its prey, and host plant in agro-ecosystems. "
negative,"Insect transgenesis and its potential role in agriculture and human health. The ability to genetically engineer insects other than Drosophila melanogaster has further extended modern genetic techniques into important insect pest species ranging from fruit fly pests of horticulture to mosquito vectors of human disease. In only a relatively short period of time, a range of transgenes have been inserted into more than 10 insect pest species. Genetic transformation of these pest species has proven to be a very important laboratory tool in analyzing gene function and effects on phenotype however the full extension of this technology into the field is yet to be realized. Here we briefly review the development of transgenic technology in pest insect species and discuss the challenges that remain in this applied area of insect genetics and entomology. "
negative,"Genome Editing: From Drosophila to Non-Model Insects and Beyond. Insect is the largest group of animals on land. Many insect species inflict economical and health losses to humans. Yet many more benefit us by helping to maintain balances in our ecosystem. The benefits that insects offer remain largely untapped, justifying our continuing efforts to develop tools to better understand their biology and to better manage their activities. Here we focus on reviewing the progresses made in the development of genome engineering tools for model insects. Instead of detailed descriptions of the molecular mechanisms underlying each technical advance, we focus our discussion on the logistics for implementing similar tools in non-model insects. Since none of the tools were developed specific for insects, similar approaches can be applied to other non-model organisms. "
positive,"Bmo-miR-79 downregulates the expression of BmEm4 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. MicroRNA is an important regulation factor in insect development and metamorphosis. It has been reported that E(spl)m4 is a miRNA-targeted gene, as well as the target of the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila. The expression of E(spl)m4 can be regulated by microRNA and further affect the neural development of Drosophila. Here, we found that BmEm4, an ortholog of E(spl)m4 from Bombyx mori, was the target gene of bmo-miR-79, with target sites containing the Brd and K boxes of the BmEm4_3'UTR, which was validated by the dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. Furthermore, bmo-miR-79 mimics can inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in BmN cells after transfection, and bmo-miR-79 can also inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in different developmental stages of Bombyx mori at a posttranscriptional level, to different degrees. The EMSA test further showed that bmo-miR-79 could bind to BmAGO2, which is the Bombyx mori argonaute2 protein, suggesting that bmo-miR-79 might regulate the expression of BmEm4 by forming miRISC complexes with BmAGO2. Taken together, bmo-miR-79 could regulate the expression of BmEm4 mediated by BmAGO2 and further affect its function in the silkworm Bombyx mori. "
positive,"Molecular characterization, spatial-temporal expression and magnetic response patterns of iron-sulfur cluster assembly1 (IscA1) in the rice planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The mechanisms of magnetoreception have been proposed as the magnetite-based, the chemical radical-pair and biocompass model, in which magnetite particles, the cryptochrome (Cry) or iron-sulfur cluster assembly 1 (IscA1) may be involved. However, little is known about the association among the molecules. Here we investigated the molecular characterization and the mRNA expression of IscA1 in different developmental stages, tissues and magnetic fields in the migratory brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens. NlIscA1 contains an open reading frame of 390 bp, encoding amino acids of 129, with the predicted molecular weight of 14.0 kDa and the isoelectric point of 9.10. Well-conserved Fe-S cluster binding sites were observed in the predicted protein. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated NlIscA1 to be clustered into the insect's IscA1. NlIscA1 showed up-regulated mRNA expression during the period of migration. The mRNA expression of NlIscA1 could be detected in all the three tissues of head, thorax and abdomen, with the highest expression level in the abdomen. For the macropterous migratory Nilaparvata lugens, mRNA expression of NlIscA1 and N. lugens cryptochrome1 (Nlcry1) were up-regulated under the magnetic fields of 5 Gauss and 10 Gauss in strength (vs. local geomagnetic field), while N. lugens cryptochrome2 (Nlcry2) remained stable. For the brachyterous non-migratory Nilaparvata lugens, no significant changes were found in mRNA expression of NlIscA1, Nlcry1 and Nlcry2 among different magnetic fields. These findings preliminarily reveal that the expression of NlIscA1 and Nlcry1 exhibited coordinated responses to the magnetic field. It suggests some potential associations among the putative magneto-sensitive molecules of cryptochrome and iron-sulfur cluster assembly. "
negative,"A genome-wide signature of positive selection in ancient and recent invasive expansions of the honey bee Apis mellifera. Apis mellifera originated in Africa and extended its range into Eurasia in two or more ancient expansions. In 1956, honey bees of African origin were introduced into South America, their descendents admixing with previously introduced European bees, giving rise to the highly invasive and economically devastating ""Africanized"" honey bee. Here we ask whether the honey bee's out-of-Africa expansions, both ancient and recent (invasive), were associated with a genome-wide signature of positive selection, detected by contrasting genetic differentiation estimates (F(ST)) between coding and noncoding SNPs. In native populations, SNPs in protein-coding regions had significantly higher F(ST) estimates than those in noncoding regions, indicating adaptive evolution in the genome driven by positive selection. This signal of selection was associated with the expansion of honey bees from Africa into Western and Northern Europe, perhaps reflecting adaptation to temperate environments. We estimate that positive selection acted on a minimum of 852-1,371 genes or approximately 10% of the bee's coding genome. We also detected positive selection associated with the invasion of African-derived honey bees in the New World. We found that introgression of European-derived alleles into Africanized bees was significantly greater for coding than noncoding regions. Our findings demonstrate that Africanized bees exploited the genetic diversity present from preexisting introductions in an adaptive way. Finally, we found a significant negative correlation between F(ST) estimates and the local GC content surrounding coding SNPs, suggesting that AT-rich genes play an important role in adaptive evolution in the honey bee. "
positive,"Germline expression of the hunchback orthologues in the asexual viviparous aphids: a conserved feature within the Aphididae. In animals, differentiation of germline from soma usually takes place during embryogenesis. Genes and their products that are preferentially expressed in the embryonic germ cells are regarded as candidates for maintaining germline fate or promoting germline identity. In Drosophila, for example, the protein encoded by the germline gene vasa is specifically restricted to the germ cells, while products of the gap gene hunchback (hb), a somatic gene, are preferentially expressed in the neuroblasts. In this study, we report the expression of both messenger RNA and protein encoded by Aphb, an hb orthologue in the asexual viviparous pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, in germ cells as well as in neuroblasts. We infer that expression of Aphb messenger RNA in the germ cells during the formation of germaria is required for the anterior localization of Aphb in the protruding oocytes. Germarial expression and anterior localization of ApKrüppel was also identified but, unlike Aphb, its expression was not detected in the migrating germ cells. Very similar patterns of hb expression were also identified in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, suggesting that germline expression of hb is conserved within the Aphididae. To date, this pattern of hb germline expression has not been reported in other insects. "
negative,"A breakthrough in the artificial cultivation of Chinese cordyceps on a large-scale and its impact on science, the economy, and industry. Chinese cordyceps, an entity of the Chinese caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis, syn. Cordyceps sinensis) that parasitizes ghost moth larvae, is one of the best known traditional Chinese medicines and is found exclusively on the Tibetan Plateau with limited natural resources. Although the fungus O. sinensis can grow on artificial substrates and the ghost moth has been successfully reared, the large-scale artificial cultivation of Chinese cordyceps has only recently been accomplished after several decades of efforts and attempts. In this article, research progress related to this breakthrough from living habitats, the life history of the fungus, its host insect, fungal isolation and culture, host larvae rearing, infection cycle of the fungus to the host, primordium induction, and fruiting body development have been reviewed. An understanding of the basic biology of O. sinensis, its host insect and the simulation of the Tibetan alpine environment resulted in the success of artificial cultivation on a large scale. Practical workshop production has reached annual yields of 2.5, 5, and 10 tons in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. There was no difference in the chemical components detected between the cultivated and natural Chinese cordyceps. However, the artificial cultivation system can be controlled to avoid heavy metal contamination and results in high-quality products. Although omics studies, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies, have helped to understand the biology of the fungus, the success of the artificial cultivation of the Chinese cordyceps is clearly a milestone and provides the possibility for research on the in-depth mechanisms of the interaction between the fungus and host insects and their adaptation to the harsh habitats. This cultivation will not only result in a large industry to alleviate the pressure of human demand but also protect the limited natural resources for sustainable utilization. "
negative,"Draft genome of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, a major forest pest. BACKGROUND: The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is the most serious insect pest of western North American pine forests. A recent outbreak destroyed more than 15 million hectares of pine forests, with major environmental effects on forest health, and economic effects on the forest industry. The outbreak has in part been driven by climate change, and will contribute to increased carbon emissions through decaying forests. RESULTS: We developed a genome sequence resource for the mountain pine beetle to better understand the unique aspects of this insect's biology. A draft de novo genome sequence was assembled from paired-end, short-read sequences from an individual field-collected male pupa, and scaffolded using mate-paired, short-read genomic sequences from pooled field-collected pupae, paired-end short-insert whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing reads of mRNA from adult beetle tissues, and paired-end Sanger EST sequences from various life stages. We describe the cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, and plant cell wall-degrading enzyme gene families important to the survival of the mountain pine beetle in its harsh and nutrient-poor host environment, and examine genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism variation. A horizontally transferred bacterial sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase was evident in the genome, and its tissue-specific transcription suggests a functional role for this beetle. CONCLUSIONS: Despite Coleoptera being the largest insect order with over 400,000 described species, including many agricultural and forest pest species, this is only the second genome sequence reported in Coleoptera, and will provide an important resource for the Curculionoidea and other insects. "
negative,"CRISPR / Cas9-mediated knockout of two eye pigmentation genes in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is one of the most destructive insect pests in Asia, demonstrating high fertility and causing huge crop losses by sucking sap of rice as well as transmitting viruses. However, functional genomic studies on N. lugens are seriously constrained by lack of genetic tools. Here, we employed two eye pigmentation genes to generate germ-line mutations in N. lugens using the CRISPR / Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats / CRISPR-associated) system. We showed that injection of single guide RNA of the cinnabar gene of N. lugens (Nl-cn) into pre-blastoderm eggs induced insertion and deletion (indels) in the founder generation (G0), which were heritably transmitted to the following G1 generation, leading to bright red compound eyes and ocelli. Mutations of N. lugens white (Nl-w) generated a high mutant rate of up to 27.3%, resulting in mosaic eyes consisting of white and lightly pigmented ommatidia in both G0 and G1 individuals. The specificity of CRISPR / Cas9-mediated mutagenesis was further bolstered by PCR and RNA interference-based knockdown analysis. These results show that CRISPR / Cas9-mediated gene editing is achievable in a hemipteran insect, offering a valuable tool for the study of functional genomics and pest management in this planthopper species. "
negative,"Structure of the yellow sac spider Cheiracanthium punctorium genes provides clues to evolution of insecticidal two-domain knottin toxins. Yellow sac spiders (Cheiracanthium punctorium, family Miturgidae) are unique in terms of venom composition, because, as we show here, two-domain toxins have replaced the usual one-domain peptides as the major constituents. We report the structure of the two-domain Che. punctorium toxins (CpTx), along with the corresponding cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. At least three groups of insecticidal CpTx were identified, each consisting of several members. Unlike many cone snail and snake toxins, accelerated evolution is not typical of cptx genes, which instead appear to be under the pressure of purifying selection. Both CpTx modules present the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK), or knottin signature; however, the sequence similarity between the domains is low. Conversely, notable similarity was found between separate domains of CpTx and one-domain toxins from spiders of the Lycosidae family. The observed chimerism is a landmark of exon shuffling events, but in contrast to many families of multidomain protein genes no introns were found in the cptx genes. Considering the possible scenarios, we suggest that an early transcription-mediated fusion event between two related one-domain toxin genes led to the emergence of a primordial cptx-like sequence. We conclude that evolution of toxin variability in spiders appears to be quite different from other venomous animals.  "
negative,"A model species for agricultural pest genomics: the genome of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The Colorado potato beetle is one of the most challenging agricultural pests to manage. It has shown a spectacular ability to adapt to a variety of solanaceaeous plants and variable climates during its global invasion, and, notably, to rapidly evolve insecticide resistance. To examine evidence of rapid evolutionary change, and to understand the genetic basis of herbivory and insecticide resistance, we tested for structural and functional genomic changes relative to other arthropod species using genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and community annotation. Two factors that might facilitate rapid evolutionary change include transposable elements, which comprise at least 17% of the genome and are rapidly evolving compared to other Coleoptera, and high levels of nucleotide diversity in rapidly growing pest populations. Adaptations to plant feeding are evident in gene expansions and differential expression of digestive enzymes in gut tissues, as well as expansions of gustatory receptors for bitter tasting. Surprisingly, the suite of genes involved in insecticide resistance is similar to other beetles. Finally, duplications in the RNAi pathway might explain why Leptinotarsa decemlineata has high sensitivity to dsRNA. The L. decemlineata genome provides opportunities to investigate a broad range of phenotypes and to develop sustainable methods to control this widely successful pest. "
negative,"Genomewide clonal analysis of lethal mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster eye: comparison of the X chromosome and autosomes. Using a large consortium of undergraduate students in an organized program at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), we have undertaken a functional genomic screen in the Drosophila eye. In addition to the educational value of discovery-based learning, this article presents the first comprehensive genomewide analysis of essential genes involved in eye development. The data reveal the surprising result that the X chromosome has almost twice the frequency of essential genes involved in eye development as that found on the autosomes. "
negative,"A computational and experimental approach to validating annotations and gene predictions in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Five years after the completion of the sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, the number of protein-coding genes it contains remains a matter of debate; the number of computational gene predictions greatly exceeds the number of validated gene annotations. We have assembled a collection of >10,000 gene predictions that do not overlap existing gene annotations and have developed a process for their validation that allows us to efficiently prioritize and experimentally validate predictions from various sources by sequencing RT-PCR products to confirm gene structures. Our data provide experimental evidence for 122 protein-coding genes. Our analyses suggest that the entire collection of predictions contains only approximately 700 additional protein-coding genes. Although we cannot rule out the discovery of genes with unusual features that make them refractory to existing methods, our results suggest that the D. melanogaster genome contains approximately 14,000 protein-coding genes. "
positive,"Orcokinins regulate the expression of neuropeptide precursor genes related to ecdysis in the hemimetabolous insect Rhodnius prolixus. Ecdysis is a vital process for insects, during which they shed the old cuticle in order to emerge as the following developmental stage. Given its relevance for survival and reproduction, ecdysis is tightly regulated by peptidic hormones that conform an interrelated neuromodulatory network. This network was studied in species that undergo a complete metamorphosis, but not in hemimetabola. In a recent work, we demonstrated that orcokinin neuropeptides are essential for ecdysis to occur in the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus. Here we performed gene silencing, quantitative PCR and in vitro treatments in order to study the interrelationships between RhoprOKs and hormones such as ecdysis triggering hormone, corazonin, eclosion hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide and ecdysone. Our results suggest that RhoprOKs directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other genes. Whereas RhoprOKA is centrally involved in the regulation of gene expression, RhoprOKB is implicated in processes related to midgut physiology. Therefore, we propose that the different transcripts encoded in RhoprOK gene could integrate signaling cues, in order to coordinate the nutritional state with development and ecdysis. Given the emerging data that point to OKs as important factors for survival and reproduction, they could be candidates in the search for new insect management strategies based on neuroendocrine targets. "
negative,"Insect mitochondrial genomics 2: The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a giant stonefly, Pteronarcys princeps, asymmetric directional mutation bias, and conserved plecopteran A+T-region elements. Mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences of insects are receiving renewed attention in molecular phylogentic studies, studies of mt-genome rearrangement, and other unusual molecular phenomena, such as translational frameshifting. At present, the basal neopteran lineages are poorly represented by mt-genome sequences. Complete mt-genome sequences are available in the databases for only the Orthoptera and Blatteria; 9 orders are unrepresented. Here, we present the complete mt-genome sequence of a giant stonefly, Pteronarcys princeps (Plecoptera; Pteronarcyidae). The 16,004 bp genome is typical in its genome content, gene organisation, and nucleotide composition. The genome shows evidence of strand-specific mutational biases, correlated with the time between the initiation of leading and the initiation of lagging strand replication. Comparisons with other insects reveal that this trend is seen in other insect groups, but is not universally consistent among sampled mt-genomes. The A+T region is compared with that of 2 stoneflies in the family Peltoperlidae. Conserved stem-loop structures and sequence blocks are noted between these distantly related families. "
negative,"Molecular cloning and characterization of a prenyltransferase from the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii. Prenyltransferases play a key role in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Here, a cDNA encoding a prenyltransferase was isolated from the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, which consists of 1354 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 394 amino acids (AgIPPS). Subsequent sequencing of AgIPPS genomic DNA resulted in one 3138-bp sequence. Southern blotting analysis indicated that only a single IPPS gene exists in the cotton aphid. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that AgIPPS transcripts were mainly present at the corpora allatum, but small quantity could be detected in tissues other than the corpora allatum. Transcript abundance changed in an alternative manner at different life stages. High expression was observed in embryos, second and forth instar nymphs and adults, but only low level was detected in the first and third instars. Functional expression, activity assay and product analysis revealed that the mature form of AgIPPS (AgIPPS-S) could efficiently convert labeled isopentenyl diphosphate in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate to both geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). These data suggested that, unlike the green peach aphid and the pea aphid, the cotton aphid appears to contain only a single IPPS with dual FPP / GPP synthase activity. "
negative,"The closely related neuropeptide genes encoding adipokinetic hormones I and II have very different 5'-flanking regions. Adipokinetic hormones I and II are 10- and 8-amino-acid grasshopper neuropeptides that are derived from 63- and 61-amino-acid peptide precursors, respectively. Each precursor is encoded by a separate gene consisting of three very small exons separated by two large introns. The identical exon structure of the two genes suggests that they evolved through duplication of a common ancestral gene. Despite the precise conservation of exon structure and the similarity of the coding sequences, the two genes have very different 5'-flanking regions, suggesting that they are differentially regulated. For example, sequences similar to the vertebrate insulin enhancer elements NIR and FAR are present upstream of the promoter region of the adipokinetic hormone II gene, but not in the adipokinetic hormone I gene. Both of these insect genes contain short interspersed repetitive DNA sequences in their introns that may have facilitated a gene duplication event. "
negative,"Feasibility, limitation and possible solutions of RNAi-based technology for insect pest control. Numerous studies indicate that target gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) could lead to insect death. This phenomenon has been considered as a potential strategy for insect pest control, and it is termed RNAi-mediated crop protection. However, there are many limitations using RNAi-based technology for pest control, with the effectiveness target gene selection and reliable double-strand RNA (dsRNA) delivery being two of the major challenges. With respect to target gene selection, at present, the use of homologous genes and genome-scale high-throughput screening are the main strategies adopted by researchers. Once the target gene is identified, dsRNA can be delivered by micro-injection or by feeding as a dietary component. However, micro-injection, which is the most common method, can only be used in laboratory experiments. Expression of dsRNAs directed against insect genes in transgenic plants and spraying dsRNA reagents have been shown to induce RNAi effects on target insects. Hence, RNAi-mediated crop protection has been considered as a potential new-generation technology for pest control, or as a complementary method of existing pest control strategies; however, further development to improve the efficacy of protection and range of species affected is necessary. In this review, we have summarized current research on RNAi-based technology for pest insect management. Current progress has proven that RNAi technology has the potential to be a tool for designing a new generation of insect control measures. To accelerate its practical application in crop protection, further study on dsRNA uptake mechanisms based on the knowledge of insect physiology and biochemistry is needed. "
negative,"Genome Investigations of Vector Competence in Aedes aegypti to Inform Novel Arbovirus Disease Control Approaches. Dengue (DENV), yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus transmission to humans by a mosquito host is confounded by both intrinsic and extrinsic variables. Besides virulence factors of the individual arboviruses, likelihood of virus transmission is subject to variability in the genome of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The ""vectorial capacity"" of A. aegypti varies depending upon its density, biting rate, and survival rate, as well as its intrinsic ability to acquire, host and transmit a given arbovirus. This intrinsic ability is known as ""vector competence"". Based on whole transcriptome analysis, several genes and pathways have been predicated to have an association with a susceptible or refractory response in A. aegypti to DENV infection. However, the functional genomics of vector competence of A. aegypti is not well understood, primarily due to lack of integrative approaches in genomic or transcriptomic studies. In this review, we focus on the present status of genomics studies of DENV vector competence in A. aegypti as limited information is available relative to the other arboviruses. We propose future areas of research needed to facilitate the integration of vector and virus genomics and environmental factors to work towards better understanding of vector competence and vectorial capacity in natural conditions. "
negative,"Polydnavirus genes and genomes: emerging gene families and new insights into polydnavirus replication. Polydnavirus genome sequencing is providing new insights into viral genome organization and viral gene function. Sequence analyses demonstrate that the genomes of these viral mutualists are largely noncoding but maintain genes and gene families that are unrelated to other viral genes. Interestingly, these organizational patterns in polydnavirus genomes are evident in both the bracovirus and ichnovirus genera, even though these two genera are evolutionarily unrelated. The identity and function of some polydnavirus gene families are considered with some functions experimentally supported and others implied by homology relationships with known insect genes. The evidence relative to polydnavirus origins and evolution is considered but remains an area of speculation. However, sequencing of these viral genomes has been informative and provides opportunities for productive investigation of these unusual mutualistic insect viruses. "
negative,"Genome sequence of a polydnavirus: insights into symbiotic virus evolution. Little is known of the fate of viruses involved in long-term obligatory associations with eukaryotes. For example, many species of parasitoid wasps have symbiotic viruses to manipulate host defenses and to allow development of parasitoid larvae. The complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA enclosed in the virus particles injected by a parasitoid wasp revealed a complex organization, resembling a eukaryote genomic region more than a viral genome. Although endocellular symbiont genomes have undergone a dramatic loss of genes, the evolution of symbiotic viruses appears to be characterized by extensive duplication of virulence genes coding for truncated versions of cellular proteins. "
negative,"The search for novel insecticide targets in the post-genomics era, with a specific focus on G-protein coupled receptors. Insects are considered pests globally, implicated in the destruction of agricultural fields and transmission of pathogens that cause deadly human diseases, such as dengue, Zika and malaria. The diversity of the insecticide arsenal has remained stagnant for decades, but the recent rise of insecticide resistance fueled the discovery of novel modes of action, and the power of genomics has reinvigorated this search. This review discusses the importance of comparative and functional insect genomics in the identification of potential gene targets for an insecticidal mode of action with low off-target toxicity. Due to the global participation in the sequencing and annotation of insect genomes, the targeting of specific genes with molecular tools like RNAi and CRISPR / Cas9 for genome engineering and consequent functional identification and validation has become more efficient. While there are multiple avenues to explore for insecticidal candidates, this review identifies G-protein coupled receptors as attractive targets, and hones in on the octopamine and dopamine receptors due to their potential. "
negative,"Ikirara, a novel transposon family from the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Members of a novel transposon family, Ikirara, were found in the genome of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. They are most abundant in A. gambiae sensu stricto, but related sequences were found in all four other tested members of this species complex. No relatives were found in A. funestus or A. stephensi. Ikirara1, the first isolated family member, was found between two of the tandem Vitellogenin (Vg) genes. Because it was found at this location in G3 and only one of nine other A. gambiae s.s. strains examined, and because its 216 bp inverted terminal repeats are 100% identical, transposition to this locus may have been recent. Ikirara1 inverted repeat terminal sequences are similar to those of DNA to DNA transposons of the mariner / Tc1 and hAT superfamilies. Also similar to mariner / Tc1 elements, insertion of Ikirara1 apparently created a duplication of the dinucleotide TA at the target site. "
positive,"Use of tyrosine hydroxylase RNAi to study Megoura viciae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) sequestration of its host's l-DOPA for body melanism. Melanism in insects is important for their physical protection, immunoreactions, and sclerotization. The vetch aphid, Megoura viciae (Buckton), has relatively strong tanning in its prothorax, head, antennae, cornicles, and legs. It was hypothesized that M. viciae may sequester the high level of l-DOPA in its host Vicia faba to help in its melanization process for ecological adaptation. To confirm this hypothesis, the amount of l-DOPA in M. viciae was modified and quantified. We first generated a Trifolium repens (clover, low l-DOPA containing) host to cut off the extra l-DOPA intake by M. viciae. The rate-limiting tyrosine hydroxylase gene of M. viciae (MV-TH) was then cloned and analyzed. To further reduce the l-DOPA level in the insect, RNAi was used to downregulate the transcriptional level of MV-TH. Our results confirmed that M. viciae could indeed sequester l-DOPA in its body, and its ample storage of this amino acid could be the reason for the strong tanning of its body. M. viciae reared on T. repens could upregulate its MV-TH to enhance l-DOPA biosynthesis and thus maintain a high level of l-DOPA. The MV-TH repression by RNAi lasted for about 3 days, successfully decreasing the l-DOPA level. Aside from a slight decrease in exuvia tanning, no other obvious change in body appearance was detected in the RNAi-treated insect. Although M. viciae can obtain most of its l-DOPA directly from its original host, its internal l-DOPA synthetase is still functional, especially when extra l-DOPA is removed from the diet. This capability to enhance its shield ensures the ecological adaptation of this insect. "
negative,"Comparative and functional genomics of lipases in holometabolous insects. Lipases have key roles in insect lipid acquisition, storage and mobilisation and are also fundamental to many physiological processes underpinning insect reproduction, development, defence from pathogens and oxidative stress, and pheromone signalling. We have screened the recently sequenced genomes of five species from four orders of holometabolous insects, the dipterans Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, the hymenopteran Apis mellifera, the moth Bombyx mori and the beetle Tribolium castaneum, for the six major lipase families that are also found in other organisms. The two most numerous families in the insects, the neutral and acid lipases, are also the main families in mammals, albeit not in Caenorhabditis elegans, plants or microbes. Total numbers of the lipases vary two-fold across the five insect species, from numbers similar to those in mammals up to numbers comparable to those seen in C. elegans. Whilst there is a high degree of orthology with mammalian lipases in the other four families, the great majority of the insect neutral and acid lipases have arisen since the insect orders themselves diverged. Intriguingly, about 10% of the insect neutral and acid lipases have lost motifs critical for catalytic function. Examination of the length of lid and loop regions of the neutral lipase sequences suggest that most of the insect lipases lack triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis activity, although the acid lipases all have intact cap domains required for TAG hydrolysis. We have also reviewed the sequence databases and scientific literature for insights into the expression profiles and functions of the insect neutral and acid lipases and the orthologues of the mammalian adipose triglyceride lipase which has a pivotal role in lipid mobilisation. These data suggest that some of the acid and neutral lipase diversity may be due to a requirement for rapid accumulation of dietary lipids. The different roles required of lipases at the four discrete life stages of holometabolous insects may also contribute to the diversity of lipases required by insects. In addition, insects use lipases to perform roles for which there are no correlates in mammals, including as yolk and male accessory gland proteins. "
negative,"Genome-wide dissection of sex determination genes in the highly invasive whitefly species Bemisia tabaci Q / MED. Sex determination genes are important regulators of reproduction as well as of the development of both behavioural and morphological sex characteristics. The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is an emerging insect pest worldwide. The recent release of the genome sequence of the highly invasive B. tabaciQ / MED allows us to investigate the mechanisms and genes involved in sex determination. The combined genome and transcriptome-wide analyses identified 26 genes putatively associated with sex determination in B. tabaciQ / MED. The temporal profiles of these genes exhibited a consistent expression pattern at all B. tabaci developmental stages: the highest transcript levels were detected in eggs (21 genes, 80.8%) and the lowest in adults (24 genes, 92.3%). The expression pattern was further validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis. Alternative splicing analysis found that (1) da and mle have sex-specific isoforms in B. tabaci adults, whereas Imp does not, and (2) exon skipping is a common splicing mechanism involved in B. tabaci sex determination. This research provides a comprehensive list of genes involved in B. tabaci sex determination and provides an opportunity to further understand the mechanisms underlying sex determination in a globally invasive insect pest that reproduces both sexually and asexually. "
positive,"Molecular cloning of a multidomain cysteine protease and protease inhibitor precursor gene from the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and functional expression of the cathepsin F-like cysteine protease domain. A Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) cysteine protease inhibitor, MsCPI, purified from larval hemolymph has an apparent molecular mass of 11.5 kDa, whereas the size of the mRNA is very large (∼9 kilobases). MsCPI cDNA consists of a 9,273 nucleotides that encode a polypeptide of 2,676 amino acids, which includes nine tandemly repeated MsCPI domains, four cystatin-like domains and one procathepsin F-like domain. The procathepsin F-like domain protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and processed to its active mature form by incubation with pepsin. The mature enzyme hydrolyzed Z-Leu-Arg-MCA, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA and Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA rapidly, whereas hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Tyr-MCA and Z-Arg-Arg-MCA was very slow. The protease was strongly inhibited by MsCPI, egg-white cystatin and sunflower cystatin with K(i) values in the nanomolar range. When the MsCPI tandem protein linked to two MsCPI domains was treated with proteases, it was degraded by the cathepsin F-like protease. However, tryptic digestion converted the MsCPI tandem protein to an active inhibitory form. These data support the hypothesis that the mature MsCPI protein is produced from the MsCPI precursor protein by trypsin-like proteases. The resulting mature MsCPI protein probably plays a role in the regulation of the activity of endogenous cysteine proteases. "
negative,"Insect iron binding proteins: insights from the genomes. Sequencing of the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, and Bombyx mori provided an opportunity to examine the diversity and organization of genes encoding insect transferrins (Tsf) and ferritins. Information obtained from the genomes significantly advances our knowledge of these major players in insect iron metabolism and complements the results of molecular studies on their temporal, spatial, and inducible expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms conducted in diverse insect species. Analysis of genes encoding new members of the Tsf family and non-secreted ferritin subunits allows making preliminary hypotheses about their possible functions and opens possibilities to study lesser-known aspects of insect iron homeostasis. Proteomic and gene expression studies that followed the whole genome sequencing quickly contribute to defining or better understanding of the important and diverse biological roles of Tsf and ferritin, particularly their involvement in insect's defenses against oxidative stress and infection. "
positive,"Expression of a doublesex homologue is altered in sexual mosaics of Ostrinia scapulalis moths infected with Wolbachia. A homologue of the sex-determining gene doublesex, Osdsx, was identified in the adzuki bean borer Ostrinia scapulalis. Three isoforms of the Osdsx transcript (Osdsx(M), Osdsx(FL) and Osdsx(FS)) differing in length were found. Osdsx(M) was specifically found in males, and contained an 852-bp ORF encoding a protein of 284 amino acids. Osdsx(FL) and Osdsx(FS) were found in females, and had the same 813-bp ORF encoding a protein of 271 amino acids. The Osdsx gene was inferred to have six exons and five introns. The variation in the transcript could be explained by the alternative splicing of Osdsx: Osdsx(M) was formed by the splicing of exons 1, 2, 5 and 6, Osdsx(FS) by the splicing of exons 1-4 and 6, and Osdsx(FL) by the splicing of exons 1-6. RT-PCR analysis indicated that Osdsx was transcribed in a sex-specific manner in all somatic tissues examined, regardless of developmental stage. In Wolbachia-induced sexual mosaics of O. scapulalis, which are genetically male, the female-specific isoform of Osdsx (Osdsx(FL)) was shown to be expressed in addition to the male-specific isoform (Osdsx(M)). This finding provides the first evidence that Wolbachia manipulates the sex of its host by interfering either with the sex-specific splicing of Osdsx itself or with another upstream sex determination process. "
negative,"Mobility of the piggyBac transposon in embryos of the vectors of Dengue fever (Aedes albopictus) and La Crosse encephalitis (Ae. triseriatus). The re-emergence of arboviral diseases such as Dengue Fever and La Crosse encephalitis is primarily due to the failure of insect vector control strategies. The development of a procedure capable of producing stable germ-line transformants in the insect vectors of these diseases would bridge the gap between gene expression systems being developed to curb vector transmission and the identification of important genes and regulatory sequences and their reintroduction back into the insect genome in the form of vector control strategies. The transposable element piggyBac is capable of transposition in a variety of insect species, and could serve as a versatile insect transformation vector. Using plasmid-based excision and transposition assays, we report that this short-ITR transposon undergoes precise, transposase-dependent excision and transposition in embryos of Aedes albopictus and Aedes triseriatus, the vectors of Dengue fever and LaCrosse encephalitis, respectively. These assays allow us easily and rapidly to confirm and assess the potential utility of piggyBac as a gene transfer tool in a given species. piggyBac is an exceptionally mobile and versatile genetic transformation vector, comparable to other transposons currently in use for the transformation of insects. The mobility of the piggyBac element seen in both Ae. albopictus and Ae. triseriatus is further evidence that it can be employed as a germ-line vector in important insect disease vectors. "
positive,"Characterization and expression profiling of odorant-binding proteins in Anoplophora glabripennis Motsch. In insects, olfaction plays a critical role in locating hosts, recognizing mates, and selecting oviposition sites. The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis Motschulsky) feeds on 43 species of trees in 15 families, but its chemosensory mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, genes encoding 61 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) were identified from the published genome and our previous A. glabripennis transcriptomic data. To investigate their physiological functions, we performed expression profiling of all AglaOBPs in the antennae, legs, and maxillary palps of both sexes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered A. glabripennis OBPs into four subgroups, comprising 29 Minus-C OBPs, 15 Antennae-binding proteins (ABPIIs), 10 Classic OBPs, and one Plus-C OBP. 12 AglaOBP genes were expressed specifically in antennae, and AglaOBP3, AglaOBP18, AglaOBP21, AglaOBP33, AglaOBP41, AglaOBP45, and AglaOBP47 were particularly highly expressed in male antennae. These proteins may function in the detection of female sex pheromones. AglaOBP23 and AglaOBP44 were preferentially expressed in maxillary palps. Expression profiling suggests that many OBPs may be involved in olfaction and gustation, in addition to carrying hydrophobic molecules. The AglaOBPs family has acquired functional diversity concurrently with functional constraints, and further investigation could provide insight into the roles of OBPs in chemoreception. "
negative,"Genomic sequence and phylogenetic analysis of Culex flavivirus, an insect-specific flavivirus, isolated from Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) in Iowa. Adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were collected in 2007 and tested for specific viruses, including West Nile virus, as part of the ongoing arbovirus surveillance efforts in the state of Iowa. A subset of these mosquitoes (6,061 individuals in 340 pools) was further tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using flavivirus universal primers. Of the 211 pools of Culex pipiens (L.) tested, 50 were positive. One of 51 pools of Culex tarsalis Coquillet was also positive. The flavivirus minimum infection rates (expressed as the number of positive mosquito pools per 1,000 mosquitoes tested) for Cx. pipiens and Cx. tarsalis were 10.3 and 1.2, respectively. Flavivirus RNA was not detected in Aedes triseriatus (Say) (52 pools), Culex erraticus (Dyar & Knab) (25 pools), or Culex territans Walker (one pool). Sequence analysis of all RT-PCR products revealed that the mosquitoes had been infected with Culex flavivirus (CxFV), an insect-specific virus previously isolated in Japan, Indonesia, Texas, Mexico, Guatemala and Trinidad. The complete genome of one isolate was sequenced, as were the envelope protein genes of eight other isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CxFV isolates from the United States (Iowa and Texas) are more closely related to CxFV isolates from Asia than those from Mexico, Guatemala, and Trinidad. "
negative,"A genomic analysis of transcytosis in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, a mechanism involved in virus transmission. Aphids are the primary vectors of plant viruses. Transmission can occur via attachment to the cuticle lining of the insect (non-circulative transmission) or after internalization in the insect cells with or without replication (circulative transmission). In this paper, we have focused on the circulative and non-propagative mode during which virions enter the cell following receptor-mediated endocytosis, are transported across the cell in vesicles and released by exocytosis without replicating. The correct uptake, transport and delivery of the vesicles cargo relies on the participation of proteins from different families which have been identified in the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome. Assemblage of this annotated dataset provides a useful basis to improve our understanding of the molecules and mechanisms involved in virus transmission by A. pisum and other aphid species. "
negative,"Genetic technologies for disease vectors. The first genetic technologies for insect vectors of disease were introduced 20 years ago. As of today there are 12 classes of genetic technologies used as functional genomic tools for insect vectors of important diseases. Although the applications of genetic technologies in insect disease vectors have been conducted primarily in mosquitoes, other insect systems could benefit from current technologies. While the various technological platforms are likely to function in diverse arthropods, the delivery of these technologies to cells and tissues of interest is the major technical constraint that limits their widespread adoption. Increased community resources of various types would enhance the adoption of these technologies and potentially eliminate technical limitations. "
negative,"Identification and partial characterization of the enzyme of omega: one of five putative DPP IV genes in Drosophila melanogaster. The omega (ome) gene product is a modifier of larval cuticle protein 5 and its alleles (and duplicates) in the third instar of Drosophila melanogaster. Using deletion mapping the locus mapped to 70F-71A on the left arm of chromosome 3. A homozygote null mutant (ome 1) shows a pleiotropic phenotype that affected the size, developmental time of the flies, and the fertility (or perhaps the behavior) of homozygous mutant males. The omega gene was verified as producing a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) by genetic analysis, substrate specificity and pH optimum. The identity of the gene was confirmed as CG32145 (cytology 70F4) in the Celera Database (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project), which is consistent with its deletion map position. The genomic structure of the gene is described and the decrease in DPPIV activity in the mutant ome1 is shown to be due to the gene CG32145 (omega). The D. melanogaster omega DPPIV enzyme was partially purified and characterized. The exons of the ome1 mutant were sequenced and a base substitution mutation in exon 4 was identified that would yield a truncated protein caused by a stop codon. A preliminary study of the compartmentalization of the omega DPPIV enzyme in several organs is also reported. "
positive,"Discovery and functional identification of fecundity-related genes in the brown planthopper by large-scale RNA interference. Recently, transcriptome and proteome data have increasingly been used to identify potential novel genes related to insect phenotypes. However, there are few studies reporting the large-scale functional identification of such genes in insects. To identify novel genes related to fecundity in the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, 115 genes were selected from the transcriptomic and proteomic data previously obtained from high- and low-fecundity populations in our laboratory. The results of RNA interference (RNAi) feeding experiments showed that 91.21% of the genes were involved in the regulation of vitellogenin (Vg) expression and may influence BPH fecundity. After RNAi injection experiments, 12 annotated genes were confirmed as fecundity-related genes and three novel genes were identified in the BPH. Finally, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) was shown to play an important role in BPH fecundity. Knockdown of CtBP not only led to lower survival, underdeveloped ovaries and fewer eggs laid but also resulted in a reduction in Vg protein expression. The novel gene resources gained from this study will be useful for constructing a Vg regulation network and may provide potential target genes for RNAi-based pest control. "
positive,"Transcriptional response of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to insecticides in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. When any living organism is frequently exposed to any drugs or toxic substances, they evolve different detoxification mechanism to confront with toxicants during absorption and metabolism. Likewise, the insects have evolved detoxification mechanisms as they are frequently exposed to different toxic secondary plant metabolites and commercial insecticides. ABC transporter superfamily is one of the largest and ubiquitous group of proteins which play an important role in phase III of the detoxification process. However, knowledge about this gene family remains largely unknown. To help fill this gap, we have identified a total of 54 ABC transporters in the Helicoverpa armigera genome which are classified into eight subfamilies (A-H) by phylogenetic analysis. The temporal and spatial expression profiles of these 54 ABC transporters throughout H. armigera development stages and seven tissues and their responses to five different insecticides, were investigated using RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of eight selected genes in different tissues and six genes responses to insecticides were confirmed by the quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, H. armigera become more sensitive to abamectin and indoxacarb when P-gp was inhibited. These results provide a foundation for further studies of ABCs in H. armigera. "
negative,"Comparative Analysis of Intra- and Inter-Specific Genomic Variability in the Peach Potato Aphid, Myzus persicae. The availability of genomic data in the last decade relating to different aphid species has allowed the analysis of the genomic variability occurring among such species, whereas intra-specific variability has hitherto very largely been neglected. In order to analyse the intra-genomic variability in the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, comparative analyses were performed revealing several clone-specific gene duplications, together with numerous deletions / rearrangements. Our comparative approach also allowed us to evaluate the synteny existing between the two M. persicae clones tested and between the peach potato aphid and the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Even if part of the observed rearrangements are related to a low quality of some assembled contigs and / or to the high number of contigs present in these aphid genomes, our evidence reveals that aphid clones are genetically more different than expected. These results suggest that the choice of performing genomes sequencing combining different biotypes / populations, as revealed in the case of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, is unlikely to be very informative in aphids. Interestingly, it is possible that the holocentric nature of aphid chromosomes favours genome rearrangements that can be successively inherited transgenerationally via the aphid's apomictic (parthenogenetic) mode of reproduction. Lastly, we evaluated the structure of the cluster of genes coding for the five histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) in order to better understand the quality of the two M. persicae genomes and thereby to improve our knowledge of this functionally important gene family. "
negative,"Multispecies coalescent analysis confirms standing phylogenetic instability in Hexapoda. The multispecies coalescent (MSC) has been increasingly used in phylogenomic analyses due to the accommodation of gene tree topological heterogeneity by taking into account population-level processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting. In this sense, the phylogeny of insect species, which are characterized by their large effective population sizes, is suitable for a coalescent-based analysis. Furthermore, studies so far recovered short internal branches at early divergences of the insect tree of life, indicating fast evolutionary radiations that increase the probability of incomplete lineage sorting in deep time. Here, we investigated the performance of the MSC for a phylogenomic data set of hexapods compiled by Misof et al. (2014, Science 346:763). Our analysis recovered the monophyly of most insect orders, and major phylogenetic relationships were in agreement with current insect systematics. We identified, however, some evolutionary associations that were consistently problematic. Most noticeable, Hexapod monophyly was disrupted by the sister group relationship between the remiped crustacean and Insecta. Additionally, the interordinal relationships within Polyneoptera and Neuropteroidea were found to be phylogenetically unstable. We show that these controversial phylogenetic arrangements were also poorly supported by previous analyses, and therefore, we evaluated their robustness to stochastic errors from sampling sites and terminals, confirming standing problems in hexapod phylogeny in the genomics age. "
positive,"Transgenic soybean plants expressing Spb18S dsRNA exhibit enhanced resistance to the soybean pod borer Leguminivora glycinivorella (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae). The soybean pod borer [SPB; Leguminivora glycinivorella (Mats.) Obraztsov] is a major soybean pest in northeastern Asia. A useful method for addressing this problem is the generation of transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that target essential insect genes. In this study, we confirmed that 18S ribosomal RNA is critical for SPB development. Downregulated Spb18S expression induced by dsRNA injection increased larval mortality rates and resulted in early pupation. We also assessed whether Spb18S is silenced in SPB larvae fed on transgenic soybean expressing Spb18S dsRNA. Transgenic plants downregulated Spb18S expression levels and second-instar larval survival rates. Moreover, such plants were less damaged by SPB larvae than control plants under field conditions. "
positive,"Molecular cloning, genomic structure, and genetic mapping of two Rdl-orthologous genes of GABA receptors in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) gene encodes a subunit of the insect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. Cyclodiene resistance in many insects is associated with replacement of a single amino acid (alanine at position 302) with either a serine or a glycine in the Rdl gene. Two Rdl-orthologous genes of GABA receptors (PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2) were cloned and sequenced from a susceptible strain (Roth) of Plutella xylostella. PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 showed 84% and 77% identity with the Rdl gene of Drosophila melanogaster at an amino acid level, respectively. The coding regions of PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 both comprise ten exons, with two alternative RNA-splicing forms in exon 3 of both genes. At the orthologous position of alanine-302 in D. melanogaster Rdl, PxGABARalpha1 has a conserved alanine at position 282. PxGABARalpha2 has a serine instead of an alanine at the equivalent position. With two informative DNA markers, both PxGABARalpha1 and PxGABARalpha2 were mapped onto the Z chromosome of P. xylostella. "
negative,"Elucidation of the genomic basis of indirect plant defense against insects. Using airborne signals to attract herbivore predators and parasitoids is an important strategy that plants use in defense against herbivorous insects. The volatiles involved in this indirect plant defense are often chemically complex and variable across species. We recently established rice as a model for studying the molecular and genomic basis of volatile-mediated indirect plant defense. Rice plants when damaged by fall armyworm larvae become highly attractive to parasitic wasps. The volatiles potentially responsible for parasitoid attraction were determined to be a blend of compounds predominated by terpenoids, of which S-linalool is the most abundant. Racemic linalool alone was shown to be effective in attracting parasitic wasps. By combining volatile profiling and microarray analysis, a catalog of candidate genes for volatile biosynthesis was identified. Three genes encoding terpene synthases were biochemically characterized. They are responsible for the production of the majority of volatile terpenes released from insect-damaged rice plants. Additional candidate genes are being currently characterized for their role in production of other insect-induced volatiles from rice plants. Identification of a complete set of key genes for synthesizing herbivory-induced volatiles in rice will provide an important reference for comparative studies of this important defense trait across a variety of plant species. "
negative,"Quantitative detection of relative expression levels of the whole genome of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus and its replication in different hosts. BACKGROUND: In recent years, a disease caused by Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) has resulted in significant loss in rice production in Southern China and has spread quickly throughout East and Southeast Asia. This virus is transmitted by an insect vector, white-backed planthopper (WBPH) Sogatella furcifera (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), in a persistent propagative manner. Aside from rice, SRBSDV can also infect numerous Poaceae plants. However, the molecular mechanism of interaction between SRBSDV and its plant or insect vector remains unclear. In order to address this, we investigated the whole viral genome relative mRNA expression level in distinct hosts and monitored their expression level in real-time in rice plants. METHODS: In this study, a reliable, rapid, and sensitive method for detecting viral gene expression transcripts is reported. A SYBR Green I based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was adopted for the quantitative detection of SRBSDV gene expression in different hosts and real-time changes in gene expression in rice. RESULTS: Compared to the relative mRNA expression level of the whole genome of SRBSDV, P3, P7-1, and P9-2 were dominantly expressed in rice and WBPH. Similarly, these genes also exhibited high expression levels in corn, suggesting that they have more important functions than other viral genes in the interaction between SRBSDV and hosts, and that they could be used as molecular detection target genes of SRBSDV. In contrast, the levels of P6 and P10 were relative low. Western blotting analysis partially was also verified our qPCR results at the level of protein expression. Analysis of the real-time changes in SRBSDV-infected rice plants revealed four distinct temporal expression patterns of the thirteen genes. Moreover, expression levels of P1 and other genes were significantly down-regulated on days 14 and 20, respectively. CONCLUSION: SRBSDV genes showed similar expression patterns in distinct hosts (rice, corn, and WBPH), indicating that SRBSDV uses the same infection strategy in plant and insect hosts. P3, P7-1, and P9-2 were the dominantly expressed genes in the three tested hosts. Therefore, they are likely to be genes with the most crucial function and could be used as sensitive molecular detection targets for SRBSDV. Furthermore, real-time changes in SRBSDV genes provided a basis for understanding the mechanism of interaction between SRBSDV and its hosts. "
negative,"Comparative mitochondrial genome analysis of Grammodes geometrica and other noctuid insects reveals conserved mitochondrial genome organization and phylogeny. The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) plays an important role in revealing molecular evolution. In this study, the complete mitogenome of Grammodes geometrica (G. geometrica) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) was sequenced and characterized. The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A + T biased, accounting for 80.49%. Most protein-coding genes (PCGs) are initiated by ATN codons except for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene, which was initiated by CGA. The order and orientation of genes with the order trnM-trnI-trnQ-nad2 is a typical rearrangement compared with those ancestral insects in which trnM is located between trnQ and nad2. Most tRNA genes were folded into the typical cloverleaf structure except for trnS1 (AGN). The A + T-rich region contains the conserved motif ""ATAGA"" followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, which was also observed in other Noctuoidea species. In addition, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees among the nucleotide alignments of five families of Noctuoidea species except the Oenosandridae. Finally, we achieved a well-supported tree, which showed that G. geometrica belongs to the Erebidae family. Moreover, the relationships at the family-level can be displayed as follows: (Notodontidae + (Erebidae + (Nolidae + (Euteliidae + Noctuidae)))). "
negative,"Two female-specific DSX proteins are encoded by the sex-specific transcripts of dsx, and are required for female sexual differentiation in two wild silkmoth species, Antheraea assama and Antheraea mylitta (Lepidoptera, Saturniidae). doublesex (dsx) is the bottom most gene of the sex-determination cascade of Drosophila melanogaster. The pre-mRNA of dsx splices to produce male- and female-specific transcripts which code for the male- and female-specific proteins, respectively. dsx homologues have been characterized from different (many in Diptera, two in Hypmenoptera and only one in Lepidoptera) insect species. Sex-specific splice forms of dsx pre-mRNA in all these species code for one male- and one female-specific DSX proteins, which regulate the downstream target genes responsible for sex-specific characters. In the present study we have cloned and characterized the dsx homologues from two saturniid silkmoths, Antheraea assama and Antheraea mylitta. The divergence time between Saturniidae and Bombycidae to which the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori belongs is estimated to be around 160.9 MY. Interestingly, the dsx pre-mRNA of these wild silkmoths sex-specifically splices to generate multiple splice variants. On the basis of their open reading frame (ORF) and conceptual translation, two female-specific (DSX(F1) and DSX(F2)) and one male-specific (DSX(M)) proteins could be inferred, in both the moths. Presence or absence of a 15 bp stretch within the ORF of the two groups of female-specific transcripts resulted in the production of two distinct female-specific DSX proteins. The sex-specific DSX proteins have common amino-terminal sequence but sex-specific carboxy termini. The two female-specific DSX proteins (DSX(F1) and DSX(F2)) share common DNA binding domain (DM domain) and oligomerization domain (OD domain) and differ only at their extreme C-termini by 21aa. Functional analysis of dsx transcripts in A. assama by dsRNA mediated knock-down resulted in complete abolition of expression of vitellogenin and hexamerin genes, the direct targets of the DSX proteins, irregular differentiation of gonads, and drastic reduction in fecundity and hatchability. Together, these results suggest the involvement of both the female-specific DSX proteins in the process of female sexual differentiation. Further, conservation of the 4th exon sequence, especially the PESS sequence responsible for the sex-specific splicing of Bmdsx in the female-specific transcripts of Aadsx and Amydsx, indicated the existence of a common mechanism of sex-specific splicing of dsx homologues in silkmoths. To our knowledge this is the first report of existence of multiple splice forms of dsx pre-mRNA encoding two female-specific DSX proteins. "
positive,"Clustered miR-2, miR-13a, miR-13b and miR-71 coordinately target Notch gene to regulate oogenesis of the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), ∼22-nt small noncoding RNAs with a crucial role in various biological processes of organisms, are usually clustered in the genome. However, little is known about the miRNA clusters involved in insect reproduction. By small RNA sequencing and quantification followed by qRT-PCR, we found that the expression of invertebrate-specific miR-2 / 13 / 71 cluster including miR-2, miR-13a, miR-13b and miR-71 significantly decreased after adult ecdysis of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation demonstrated that miR-2 / 13 / 71 bound to the protein coding sequence of Notch and downregulated its expression. Injection of miR-2 / 13 / 71 agomiRs led to significant decrease of Notch expression as well as markedly reduced levels of Vitellogenin mRNA, suppressed oocyte maturation and impaired ovarian growth. Moreover, the expression of miR-2 / 13 / 71 was repressed by juvenile hormone (JH). Our results thus point to a previously unidentified mechanism by which JH-repressed miR-2 / 13 / 71 coordinately downregulates Notch to modulate insect reproduction. The increase of JH and decrease of miR-2 / 13 / 71 expression in both previtellogenic and vitellogenic stages of adult females ensure a high level of Notch expression, critically contributing to JH-dependent vitellogenesis and oogenesis. "
negative,"Genomic hardwiring and phenotypic plasticity of terpenoid-based defenses in conifers. Over evolutionary history, conifers have faced a myriad of threats from phloem- and xylem-feeding insects, defoliating insects, and fungal pathogens. Among the trees' defenses, terpenoids appear to play a major role by harming, disabling, deterring, repelling, or otherwise reducing the fitness of potential invaders. Each of the three classes of terpenoids in conifers, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, are composed of a large number of representative compounds. In most cases, the presence of a particular terpenoid compound in the oleoresin or volatile emissions from a specific conifer can be accounted for by the expression of one of many committed terpene synthase (TPS) genes. However, while each TPS may produce one or a few major products, many produce a variety of minor products with relatively constant component ratios in the product blends. TPS genes exist in conifers in large and functionally diverse, yet monophyletic, gene families. Within these gene families, new biochemical functions of TPS appear to have evolved by gene duplication and changes in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme's active site. In addition, TPS genes may be differentially expressed prior to, during, and following attack by insects or pathogens. Thus, while the production of any particular terpenoid is hardwired into a conifer's genome, these trees have the capacity to change the mixture of terpenoids in oleoresin secretions and volatile emissions. Anatomical changes may also accompany induced terpenoid production, supplementing the plasticity of the molecular and biochemical events. "
negative,"Members of the neuropeptide transcriptional network in Helicoverpa armigera and their expression in response to light stress. Neuropeptides and peptide hormones play central roles in the regulation of various types of insect physiology and behavior. Artificial light at night, a form of environmental stress, has recently been regarded as a source of light stress on nocturnal insects. Because related genomic information is not available, molecular biological studies on the response of neuropeptides in nocturnal insects to light stress are limited. Based on the de novo sequencing of the Helicoverpa armigera head transcriptome, we obtained 124,960 unigenes. Of these, the number of unigenes annotated as neuropeptides and peptide hormones, neurotransmitter precursor processing enzymes, and neurotransmitter receptors were 34, 17, and 58, respectively. Under light stress, there were sex-specific differences in gene expression measured by qRT-PCR. The IMFamide, leucokinin and sNPF genes were differentially expressed at the mRNA level in males but not in females in response to light stress. The results provide new insights on the diversity of the neuropeptide transcriptional network of H. armigera. In addition, some neuropeptides exhibited sex-specific differential expression in response to light stress. Taken collectively, these results not only expand the catalog of known insect neuropeptides but also provide a framework for future functional studies on the physiological roles they play in the light stress response behavior of nocturnal moths. "
negative,"Evolution of the mitochondrial DNA control region in the Anopheles gambiae complex. We have sequenced the AT-rich control region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of six species in the Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex and the closely related A. christyi. Contrary to expectations, the AT-rich region in this group is evolving rather slowly, more slowly than the third position of mtDNA protein-coding genes. Despite being relatively conserved between species, we detected intraspecific and intra-individual (heteroplasmy) variation in this region. Phylogenetically, we found we could place the rare endemic A. bwambae as a sister taxon to A. melas, the same evolutionary position as indicated by chromosomal inversions. The outgroup, A. christyi, gave evidence of the root of the tree. In comparing the molecular trees with that deduced by chromosomal inversions, they are completely congruent with the exception of the placement of A. arabiensis. The anomalous position of this species can be explained by introgression with A. gambiae. From the phylogenetic position, we could infer mtDNA gene flow from A. gambiae to A. arabiensis. "
positive,"Molecular cloning and functional expression of a Drosophila receptor for the neuropeptides capa-1 and -2. The Drosophila Genome Project website contains an annotated gene (CG14575) for a G protein-coupled receptor. We cloned this receptor and found that the cloned cDNA did not correspond to the annotated gene; it partly contained different exons and additional exons located at the 5(')-end of the annotated gene. We expressed the coding part of the cloned cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells and found that the receptor was activated by two neuropeptides, capa-1 and -2, encoded by the Drosophila capability gene. Database searches led to the identification of a similar receptor in the genome from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (58% amino acid residue identities; 76% conserved residues; and 5 introns at identical positions within the two insect genes). Because capa-1 and -2 and related insect neuropeptides stimulate fluid secretion in insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, the identification of this first insect capa receptor will advance our knowledge on insect renal function. "
negative,"Eicosanoids: Exploiting Insect Immunity to Improve Biological Control Programs. Insects, like all invertebrates, express robust innate, but not adaptive, immune reactions to infection and invasion. Insect immunity is usually resolved into three major components. The integument serves as a physical barrier to infections. Within the hemocoel, the circulating hemocytes are the temporal first line of defense, responsible for clearing the majority of infecting bacterial cells from circulation. Specific cellular defenses include phagocytosis, microaggregation of hemocytes with adhering bacteria, nodulation and encapsulation. Infections also stimulate the humoral component of immunity, which involves the induced expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and activation of prophenoloxidase. These peptides appear in the hemolymph of challenged insects 6-12 hours after the challenge. Prostaglandins and other eicosanoids are crucial mediators of innate immune responses. Eicosanoid biosynthesis is stimulated by infection in insects. Inhibition of eicosanoid biosynthesis lethally renders experimental insects unable to clear bacterial infection from hemolymph. Eicosanoids mediate specific cell actions, including phagocytosis, microaggregation, nodulation, hemocyte migration, hemocyte spreading and the release of prophenoloxidase from oenocytoids. Some invaders have evolved mechanisms to suppress insect immunity; a few of them suppress immunity by targeting the first step in the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways, the enzyme phospholipase A₂. We proposed research designed to cripple insect immunity as a technology to improve biological control of insects. We used dsRNA to silence insect genes encoding phospholipase A₂, and thereby inhibited the nodulation reaction to infection. The purpose of this article is to place our view of applying dsRNA technologies into the context of eicosanoid actions in insect immunity. The long-term significance of research in this area lies in developing new pest management technologies to contribute to food security in a world with a rapidly growing human population.  "
negative,"Evolution of polydnaviruses as insect immune suppressors. Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are endogenous particles that are used by some endoparasitic hymenoptera to disrupt host immunity and development. Recent analyses of encapsidated PDV genes have increased the number of known PDV gene families, which are often closely related to insect genes. Several PDV proteins inactivate host haemocytes by damaging their actin cytoskeleton. These proteins share no significant sequence homology and occur in polyphyletic PDV genera, possibly indicating that convergent evolution has produced functionally similar immune-suppressive molecules causing a haemocyte phenotype characterised by damaged cytoskeleton and inactivation. These phenomena provide further insights into the immune-suppressive activity of PDVs and raise interesting questions about PDV evolution, a topic that has puzzled researchers ever since the discovery of PDVs. "
positive,"Latrophilin mediates insecticides susceptibility and fecundity through two carboxylesterases, esterase4 and esterase6, in Tribolium castaneum. Latrophilin (LPH) is known as an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor which involved in multiple physiological processes in organisms. Previous studies showed that lph not only involved the susceptibility to anticholinesterase insecticides but also affected fecundity in Tribolium castaneum. However, its regulatory mechanisms in these biological processes are still not clear. Here, we identified two potential downstream carboxylesterase (cce) genes of Tclph, esterase4 and esterase6, and further characterized their interactions with Tclph. After treatment of T. castaneum larvae with carbofuran or dichlorvos insecticides, the transcript levels of Tcest4 and Tcest6 were significantly induced from 12 to 72 h. RNAi against Tcest4 or Tcest6 led to the higher mortality compared with the controls after the insecticides treatment, suggesting that these two genes play a vital role in detoxification of insecticides in T. castaneum. Furthermore, with insecticides exposure to Tclph knockdown beetles, the expression of Tcest4 was upregulated but Tcest6 was downregulated, indicating that beetles existed a compensatory response against the insecticides. Additionally, RNAi of Tcest6 resulted in 43% reductions in female egg laying and completely inhibited egg hatching, which showed the similar phenotype as that of Tclph knockdown. These results indicated that Tclph affected fecundity by positively regulating Tcest6 expression. Our findings will provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of Tclph involved in physiological functions in T. castaneum. "
negative,"Renal neuroendocrine control of desiccation and cold tolerance by Drosophila suzukii. BACKGROUND: Neuropeptides are central to the regulation of physiological and behavioural processes in insects, directly impacting cold and desiccation survival. However, little is known about the control mechanisms governing these responses in Drosophila suzukii. The close phylogenetic relationship of D. suzukii with Drosophila melanogaster allows, through genomic and functional studies, an insight into the mechanisms directing stress tolerance in D. suzukii. RESULTS: Capability (Capa), leucokinin (LK), diuretic hormone 44 (DH44 ) and DH31 neuropeptides demonstrated a high level of conservation between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster with respect to peptide sequences, neuronal expression, receptor localisation, and diuretic function in the Malpighian tubules. Despite D. suzukii's ability to populate cold environments, it proved sensitive to both cold and desiccation. Furthermore, in D. suzukii, Capa acts as a desiccation- and cold stress-responsive gene, while DH44 gene expression is increased only after desiccation exposure, and the LK gene after nonlethal cold stress recovery. CONCLUSION: This study provides a comparative investigation into stress tolerance mediation by neuroendocrine signalling in two Drosophila species, providing evidence that similar signalling pathways control fluid secretion in the Malpighian tubules. Identifying processes governing specific environmental stresses affecting D. suzukii could lead to the development of targeted integrated management strategies to control insect pest populations. © 2017 The Authors.

negative,"Genome of the house fly, Musca domestica L., a  global vector of diseases with adaptations to a  septic environment. BACKGROUND: Adult house flies, Musca domestica L., are mechanical vectors of more than 100 devastating diseases that have severe consequences for human and animal health. House fly larvae play a vital role as decomposers of animal wastes, and thus live in intimate association with many animal pathogens. RESULTS: We have sequenced and analyzed the genome of the house fly using DNA from female flies. The sequenced genome is 691 Mb. Compared with Drosophila melanogaster, the genome contains a rich resource of shared and novel protein coding genes, a significantly higher amount of repetitive elements, and substantial increases in copy number and diversity of both the recognition and effector components of the immune system, consistent with life in a pathogen-rich environment. There are 146 P450 genes, plus 11 pseudogenes, in M. domestica, representing a significant increase relative to D. melanogaster and suggesting the presence of enhanced detoxification in house flies. Relative to D. melanogaster, M. domestica has also evolved an expanded repertoire of chemoreceptors and odorant binding proteins, many associated with gustation. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first genome sequence of an insect that lives in intimate association with abundant animal pathogens. The house fly genome provides a rich resource for enabling work on innovative methods of insect control, for understanding the mechanisms of insecticide resistance, genetic adaptation to high pathogen loads, and for exploring the basic biology of this important pest. The genome of this species will also serve as a close out-group to Drosophila in comparative genomic studies. "
positive,"Downregulation of female doublesex expression by oral-mediated RNA interference reduces number and fitness of Anopheles gambiae adult females. BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne diseases affect millions worldwide, with malaria alone killing over 400 thousand people per year and affecting hundreds of millions. To date, the best strategy to prevent the disease remains insecticide-based mosquito control. However, insecticide resistance as well as economic and social factors reduce the effectiveness of the current methodologies. Alternative control technologies are in development, including genetic control such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). The SIT is a pivotal tool in integrated agricultural pest management and could be used to improve malaria vector control. To apply the SIT and most other newer technologies against disease transmitting mosquitoes, it is essential that releases are composed of males with minimal female contamination. The removal of females is an essential requirement because released females can themselves contribute towards nuisance biting and disease transmission. Thus, females need to be eliminated from the cohorts prior to release. Manual separation of Anopheles gambiae pupae or adult mosquitoes based on morphology is time consuming, is not feasible on a large scale and has limited the implementation of the SIT technique. The doublesex (dsx) gene is one of the effector switches of sex determination in the process of sex differentiation in insects. Both males and females have specific splicing variants that are expressed across the different life stages. Using RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce expression of the female specific (dsxF) variant of this gene has proven to have detrimental effects to the females in other mosquito species, such as Aedes aegypti. We tested oral RNAi on dsx (AgdsxF) in An. gambiae. METHODS: We studied the expression pattern of the dsx gene in the An. gambiae G3 strain. We knocked down AgdsxF expression in larvae through oral delivery of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced by bacteria and observed its effects in adults. RESULTS: Our results show that feeding of AgdsxF dsRNA can effectively reduce (> 66%) the mRNA of female dsx transcript and that there is a concomitant reduction in the number of female larvae that achieve adulthood. Control groups produced 52% (± 3.9% SE) of adult males and 48% (± 4.0% SE) females, while AgdsxF dsRNA treated groups had 72.1% (± 4.0% SE) males vs 27.8% females (± 3.3% SE). In addition, the female adults produce fewer progeny, 37.1% (± 8.2% SE) less than the controls. The knockdown was sex-specific and had no impact on total numbers of viable male adults, in the male dsx transcripts or male fitness parameters such as longevity or body size. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that RNAi could be used to improve novel mosquito control strategies that require efficient sex separation and male-only release of An. gambiae by targeting sex determination genes such as AgdsxF. The advantages of using RNAi in a controlled setting for mosquito rearing are numerous, as the dose and time of exposure are controlled, and the possibility of off-target effects and the waste of female production would be significantly reduced. "
negative,"Novel events associated with phenotypic reversion of a P element mutant in Drosophila melanogaster. Transposable P elements have been used extensively for Drosophila mutagenesis. While their mutagenic activity has long been recognized, the mechanisms by which P elements cause mutations are varied and not completely understood. We describe here an experiment to replace a P element at vestigial (vg) that caused a strong mutant phenotype (P[21-3]) with a P element (P[21]) known to produce a very weak phenotype when inserted at vg. In addition to testing the feasibility of P element replacements at vg, our investigation led to the production of 7 new vg alleles and 1 apparent second site suppressor. All the vg21-3 revertants that we recovered had a P element inserted into the first exon of vg at the same location and in the same orientation as the original element in vg21-3, providing a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of transposon mutagenesis. A majority of the revertants arose from a previously described event: internal deletion of P sequences, including the P promoter. In addition, 3 novel reversions of the vg21-3 wing phenotype were recovered. The wings of homozygous vg21r36 flies were normal. However, vg21r36 in combination with a deletion of the vg locus exhibited a strong mutant wing phenotype. This was surprising, because the P element insertion in vg21r36 was very similar to that found in the vg21 allele, which showed only slight nicking of the wings in combination with a deletion. In vg21r4, reversion was caused by a tandem insertion of P[21] and the original P[21-3] element present in vg21-3. Finally, the vg21r7 revertant had a P[21-3] insert at vg and 3 additional P elements elsewhere in the genome. We hypothesize that reversion in the 3 novel cases might be caused by P repressor produced by an element at vg or, in the case of vg21r7, elsewhere in the genome. This raises an interesting aspect of P element evolution. While P transposons produce mutations that might prove deleterious to their host, their success in invading the genome of D. melanogaster may be explained by their ability to silence those same mutations by a range of repressor-producing elements. "
negative,"Genome sequences of Photorhabdus luminescens strains isolated from entomopathogenic nematodes from southern India. We report here draft whole genome sequences of three novel strains of Photorhabdus luminescens of 5.2-5.3 Mbps in size, and with a G + C content of 42.5% (each). Symbiotic γ-proteobacteria belonging to the genera, Photorhabdus (Family: Enterobacteriaceae) with their natural vectors, the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) (Phylum: Nematoda; Order: Rhabditida; Family: Heterorhabditidae), have emerged as important biological control agents of insect pests, and are capable of production and delivery of diverse compounds to influence host biology [1], [2], [3]. Analysis of these genomes is expected to provide enhanced insight into mechanisms of virulence, insecticidal toxin genetic diversity, antibiotic resistance and monoxenicity. The nucleotide sequence information for the three strains NBAII PLHb105, NBAII HiPL101 and NBAII H75HRPL105 has been deposited in NCBI Nucleotide database and is accessible via AZAB00000000, JTHJ00000000 and JXUR00000000 accession numbers respectively.

negative,"Complete mitochondrial genomes of four entomopathogenic nematode species of the genus Steinernema. BACKGROUND: Nematodes belonging to the genus Steinernema are insect parasites and are used as effective biological agents against soil-dwelling insect pests. Although the full nuclear genomes of multiple Steinernema species have become available recently, mitochondrial genome information for the genus is limited. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of four species of Steinernema and analysed their structure, codon usage and phylogenetic relationships. RESULTS: Mitochondrial genomes of Steinernema carpocapsae, S. glaseri, S. kushidai and S. litorale comprised 13,924, 13,851, 15,182 and 21,403 bp, respectively, with highly AT-rich nucleotide contents (AT ratio of 71.05-76.76 %). All the expected genes, including 12 protein-coding genes (encoding ATP6, CYTB, COX1-3, ND1-6 and ND4L), two rRNA genes and 22 tRNA genes were identified in the four genomes. Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of the 12 protein-coding genes identified the Steinernema species as monophyletic, representing a sister clade of Rhabditina and Ascaridida. In addition, they were more closely positioned to other Clade 10 nematodes, including Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, Aphelenchoides besseyi and Panagrellus redivivus, than to Strongyloides species. Gene arrangements and codon usage analyses supported this relationship. Mitochondrial genome comparison of two distinct strains of S. carpocapsae detected high intra-specific diversity. CONCLUSIONS: The mitochondrial genomes of four species of Steinernema determined in this study revealed inter- and intra-species divergences / diversities of mitochondrial genomes in this genus. This information provides useful insights into the phylogenetic position of the genus Steinernema within the Nematoda and represents a useful resource for selecting molecular markers for diagnosis and population studies. These data will increase our understanding of the interesting biology of insect parasites. "
negative,"Analysis of a food-borne fungal pathogen outbreak: virulence and genome of a Mucor circinelloides isolate from yogurt. Food-borne pathogens are ongoing problems, and new pathogens are emerging. The impact of fungi, however, is largely underestimated. Recently, commercial yogurts contaminated with Mucor circinelloides were sold, and >200 consumers became ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Mucoralean fungi cause the fatal fungal infection mucormycosis, whose incidence has been continuously increasing. In this study, we isolated an M. circinelloides strain from a yogurt container, and multilocus sequence typing identified the strain as Mucor circinelloides f. circinelloides. M. circinelloides f. circinelloides is the most virulent M. circinelloides subspecies and is commonly associated with human infections, whereas M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus and M. circinelloides f. griseocyanus are less common causes of infection. Whole-genome analysis of the yogurt isolate confirmed it as being close to the M. circinelloides f. circinelloides subgroup, with a higher percentage of divergence with the M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus subgroup. In mating assays, the yogurt isolate formed sexual zygospores with the (-) M. circinelloides f. circinelloides tester strain, which is congruent with its sex locus encoding SexP, the (+) mating type sex determinant. The yogurt isolate was virulent in murine and wax moth larva host systems. In a murine gastromucormycosis model, Mucor was recovered from fecal samples of infected mice for up to 10 days, indicating that Mucor can survive transit through the GI tract. In interactions with human immune cells, M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus induced proinflammatory cytokines but M. circinelloides f. circinelloides did not, which may explain the different levels of virulence in mammalian hosts. This study demonstrates that M. circinelloides can spoil food products and cause gastrointestinal illness in consumers and may pose a particular risk to immunocompromised patients. Importance: The U.S. FDA reported that yogurt products were contaminated with M. circinelloides, a mucoralean fungal pathogen, and >200 consumers complained of symptoms, including vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. The manufacturer voluntarily withdrew the affected yogurt products from the market. Compared to other food-borne pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, less focus has been placed on the risk of fungal pathogens. This study evaluates the potential risk from the food-borne fungal pathogen M. circinelloides that was isolated from the contaminated commercial yogurt. We successfully cultured an M. circinelloides isolate and found that the isolate belongs to the species M. circinelloides f. circinelloides, which is often associated with human infections. In murine and insect host models, the isolate was virulent. While information disseminated in the popular press would suggest this fungal contaminant poses little or no risk to consumers, our results show instead that it is capable of causing significant infections in animals. "
negative,"The importance of genomic novelty in social evolution. Insect societies dominate the natural world: They mould landscapes, sculpt habitats, pollinate plants, sow seeds and control pests. The secret to their success lies in the evolution of queen (reproductive) and worker (provisioner and carer) castes (Oster & Wilson 1978). A major problem in evolutionary biology is explaining the evolution of insect castes, particularly the workers (Darwin 1859). Next-generation sequencing technologies now make it possible to understand how genomic material is born, lost and reorganized in the evolution of alternative phenotypes. Such analyses are revealing a general role for novel (e.g. taxonomically restricted) genes in phenotypic innovations across the animal kingdom (Chen et al. 2013). In this issue of molecular ecology, Feldmeyer et al. (2014) provide overwhelming evidence for the importance of novel genes in caste evolution in an ant. Feldmeyer et al.'s study is important and exciting because it cements the role of genomic novelty, as well as conservation, firmly into the molecular jigsaw of social evolution. Evolution is eclectic in its exploitation of both old and new genomic material to generate replicated phenotypic innovations across the tree of life. "
negative,"Draft genome sequence of the novel enteric bacterium Galloisinimonas intestini B14T KCTC 32180, isolated from the gut of a Galloisiana species (Notoptera: Grylloblattidae) fossil insect. We report the 3.74-Mb genome sequence of Galloisinimonas intestini B14(T), isolated from the gut of one of the world's rarest insect species, Galloisiana sp., collected at a Mosan cave, Moonkyung, Gyungsangbook-do, South Korea. Strain B14(T) is a novel genus candidate of the family Enterobacteriaceae. "
positive,"Drosophila asterless and vertebrate Cep152 Are orthologs essential for centriole duplication. The centriole is the core structure of centrosome and cilium. Failure to restrict centriole duplication to once per cell cycle has serious consequences and is commonly observed in cancer. Despite its medical importance, the mechanism of centriole formation is poorly understood. Asl was previously reported to be a centrosomal protein essential for centrosome function. Here we identify mecD, a severe loss-of-function allele of the asl gene, and demonstrate that it is required for centriole and cilia formation. Similarly, Cep152, the Asl ortholog in vertebrates, is essential for cilia formation and its function can be partially rescued by the Drosophila Asl. The study of Asl localization suggests that it is closely associated with the centriole wall, but is not part of the centriole structure. By analyzing the biogenesis of centrosomes in cells depleted of Asl, we found that, while pericentriolar material (PCM) function is mildly affected, Asl is essential for daughter centriole formation. The clear absence of several centriolar markers in mecD mutants suggests that Asl is critical early in centriole duplication. "
negative,"Insect genomes: progress and challenges. In the wake of constant improvements in sequencing technologies, numerous insect genomes have been sequenced. Currently, 1219 insect genome-sequencing projects have been registered with the National Center for Biotechnology Information, including 401 that have genome assemblies and 155 with an official gene set of annotated protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics analysis showed that the expansion or contraction of gene families was associated with well-studied physiological traits such as immune system, metabolic detoxification, parasitism and polyphagy in insects. Here, we summarize the progress of insect genome sequencing, with an emphasis on how this impacts research on pest control. We begin with a brief introduction to the basic concepts of genome assembly, annotation and metrics for evaluating the quality of draft assemblies. We then provide an overview of genome information for numerous insect species, highlighting examples from prominent model organisms, agricultural pests and disease vectors. We also introduce the major insect genome databases. The increasing availability of insect genomic resources is beneficial for developing alternative pest control methods. However, many opportunities remain for developing data-mining tools that make maximal use of the available insect genome resources. Although rapid progress has been achieved, many challenges remain in the field of insect genomics. "
negative,"Genomic transitions during host race and species formation. Darwin recognized species as discontinuous, yet considered them to be formed by an incremental process of natural selection. Recent theoretical work on 'genome-wide congealing' is bridging this gap between the gradualism of divergent selection and rapid genome-wide divergence, particularly during ecological speciation-with-gene-flow. Host races and species of phytophagous insects, displaying a spectrum of divergence and gene flow among member taxa, provide model systems for testing predicted non-linear transitions from 'genic' divergence at a few uncoupled loci to 'genomic' divergence with genome-wide coupling of selected loci and strong reproductive isolation. Integrating across natural history, genomics, and evolutionary theory, emerging research suggests a tipping point from 'genic' to 'genomic' divergence between host races and species, during both sympatric speciation and secondary contact. "
negative,"Erratum to: The draft genome of a socially polymorphic halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes. During the type-setting of the final version of the article [1] some of the additional files were swapped, and several were completely replaced. The correct files are republished in this Erratum.  "
negative,"Genome engineering-based analysis of Bearded family genes reveals both functional redundancy and a nonessential function in lateral inhibition in Drosophila. Lateral inhibition mediated by Notch receptor signaling regulates the determination of sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs) in Drosophila. The selection of SOPs from proneural cluster cells appears to rely on a negative feedback loop linking activation of the Notch receptor to downregulation of its ligand Delta within each cell. The molecular basis of this regulatory feedback mechanism is not known. Here, we have tested the role of the Bearded (Brd) family genes in this process. The Drosophila genome encodes eight Brd family members that interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized (Neur) and act as inhibitors of Neur-mediated Delta signaling. Genome engineering technologies were used to create specific deletions of all eight Brd family genes. We find that the Brd family genes malpha, m4, and m6 encoded by the Enhancer of split Complex (E(spl)-C) are dispensable for Drosophila development and that deletion of the five Brd family genes encoded by the Brd Complex only reduces viability. However, deletion of all Brd family genes results in embryonic lethality. Additionally, the malpha, m4, and m6 genes act redundantly with the other five Brd family genes to spatially restrict Notch activation in stage 5 embryos. These data reveal that the Brd family genes have an essential but redundant activity. While the activity of all eight Brd genes appears to be dispensable for SOP determination, clone border studies indicate that both the relative activity levels of Neur and Brd family members influence competition for the SOP fate during lateral inhibition. We propose that inhibition of Neur-Delta interaction by Brd family members is part of the feedback loop that underlies lateral inhibition in Drosophila. "
negative,"Improved injection needles facilitate germline transformation of the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia. Germline transformation with transposon vectors is an important tool for insect genetics, but progress in developing transformation protocols for butterflies has been limited by high post-injection ova mortality. Here we present an improved glass injection needle design for injecting butterfly ova that increases survival in three Nymphalid butterfly species. Using the needles to genetically transform the common buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia, the hatch rate for injected Junonia ova was 21.7%, the transformation rate was 3%, and the overall experimental efficiency was 0.327%, a substantial improvement over previous results in other butterfly species. Improved needle design and a higher efficiency of transformation should permit the deployment of transposon-based genetic tools in a broad range of less fecund lepidopteran species.  "
negative,"Reductive genome evolution in Buchnera aphidicola. We have sequenced the genome of the intracellular symbiont Buchnera aphidicola from the aphid Baizongia pistacea. This strain diverged 80-150 million years ago from the common ancestor of two previously sequenced Buchnera strains. Here, a field-collected, nonclonal sample of insects was used as source material for laboratory procedures. As a consequence, the genome assembly unveiled intrapopulational variation, consisting of approximately 1,200 polymorphic sites. Comparison of the 618-kb (kbp) genome with the two other Buchnera genomes revealed a nearly perfect gene-order conservation, indicating that the onset of genomic stasis coincided closely with establishment of the symbiosis with aphids, approximately 200 million years ago. Extensive genome reduction also predates the synchronous diversification of Buchnera and its host; but, at a slower rate, gene loss continues among the extant lineages. A computational study of protein folding predicts that proteins in Buchnera, as well as proteins of other intracellular bacteria, are generally characterized by smaller folding efficiency compared with proteins of free living bacteria. These and other degenerative genomic features are discussed in light of compensatory processes and theoretical predictions on the long-term evolutionary fate of symbionts like Buchnera. "
positive,"Constitutive overexpression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes contributes to chlorantraniliprole resistance in Chilo suppressalis (Walker). BACKGROUND: The rice striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis (Walker), which is one of the most economically important phytophagous pests, has developed resistance to multiple insecticides. The resistance of SSB against chlorantraniliprole has been investigated in detail. However, the mechanism of its metabolic resistance has rarely been studied. RESULTS: A field population from Wuhu City, China was used to establish chlorantraniliprole resistant and susceptible strains (WHR and WHS) by laboratory continuous selection. Enzyme activities data suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in WHR. CYP6CV5, CYP9A68, CYP321F3, and CYP324A12 were significantly overexpressed in WHR (from 4.48 to 44.88-fold). These four P450 genes were expressed in the late developmental stages of WHR; however, they were almost absent during the egg stage. In addition, their expressions were much more sensitive to chlorantraniliprole induction in WHR than in WHS. Injection of individual and mixture dsRNAs reduced the expression of the four target genes (55.2-73.2% and 43.2-50.2%, respectively) and caused significant larvae mortality (55.1-65.1% and 88.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Multiple overexpressed P450 genes were potentially associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance, as confirmed by the RNA interference (RNAi) assay. Our findings suggested that metabolic resistance to chlorantraniliprole might be mediated by P450s. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
positive,"Identification, characterization and expression analysis of Anopheles stephensi double peroxidase. Peroxidases catalyze the reduction of peroxides and that, in turn, oxidize various substrates. They have been widely reported to play an important role in mosquito innate immunity against various pathogens. Here, we have characterized double heme peroxidase (AsDBLOX) gene from the Indian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. It is a true ortholog of An. gambiae DBLOX. This 4209 bp AsDBLOX gene encodes for a protein of 1402 amino acids that has two duplicated peroxidase domains, domain I (from amino acid 61 to 527) and domain II (from amino acid 714 to 1252). The first domain has only substrate binding sites and lacks all other motifs of a functional heme peroxidase (e.g. heme binding site, calcium binding site and homodimer interface). Instead, it has two integrin binding motifs-LDV (Leu-Asp-Val) and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp). The second peroxidase domain, however, has all the features of a complete heme peroxidase along with an integrin binding motif LDI (Leu-Asp-Ile). Thus, AsDBLOX gene is a unique type of peroxinectin as these groups of proteins are characterized by integrin binding motifs along with a heme peroxidase domain. We also observed that the AsDBLOX gene is expressed in all the life cycle stages of mosquito and is highly induced in the pupal stage of development which indicates its possible role in development. "
positive,"CYP6B cytochrome p450 monooxygenases from Papilio canadensis and Papilio glaucus: potential contributions of sequence divergence to host plant associations. Two groups of furanocoumarin-inducible cytochrome p450 genes, the CYP6B4 group and the CYP6B17 group, characterized in two closely related tiger swallowtails, Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis, are induced to different extents, with generally higher levels of CYP6B transcripts in P. glaucus. To investigate the evolutionary history of these CYP6B genes in the context of their association with furanocoumarin detoxification, we isolated thirteen CYP6B genes from these species. Each of these genes contains an intron at a conserved position (1334 nucleotides from the translation start site), which varies in length due to three insertion / deletions. The proximal 5' end flanking sequence from the transcription initiation site is highly conserved (91-98% nt identity). The sequence 5' to -640 is significantly variable due largely to the presence of three insertion / deletions. The sequence at the 3' end of this region contains a putative xenobiotic response element to xanthotoxin (XRE-xan), important for basal and xanthotoxin-inducible transcription of the P. polyxenes CYP6B1v3 gene, and multiple elements known to regulate vertebrate phase I and II promoters, including an XRE-AhR (Xenobiotic Response Element to Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor), an OCT-1 element (octamer protein binding site), an ARE (Antioxidant Response Element), an EcRE (Ecdysone Response Element), and an imperfect PXR (Pregnane X Receptor) responsive element (PRE). Our analyses of CYP6B genes in these two species indicate that these genes are in an early stage of divergence and that differential exposure of these two species to chemically distinct host plants resulting from geographical isolation has had functional impacts not only on the coding regions of these genes but also on their promoter regions. Thus, changes in p450 regulation as well as catalytic activity may play a role in the evolution of host plant associations in herbivorous insects. "
negative,"Anopheles stephensi Dox-A2 shares common ancestry with genes from distant groups of eukaryotes encoding a 26S proteasome subunit and is in a conserved gene cluster. The sequence of a cloned Anopheles stephensi gene showed 72% inferred amino acid identity with Drosophila melanogaster Dox-A2 and 93% with its putative ortholog in Anopheles gambiae. Dox-A2 is the reported but herein disputed structural locus for diphenol oxidase A2. Database searches identified Dox-A2 related gene sequences from 15 non-insect species from diverse groups. Phylogenetic trees based on alignments of inferred protein sequences, DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are orthologous. The only inconsistency was that the C-terminus appears to be more primitive in the yeasts than in plants. In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable. A plausible additional role, in which the 26S proteasome is implicated in regulation of phenol oxidase, would also apply to at least the mammalian genes. No function has yet been reported for the other included sequences. These were from genome projects and included Caenorhabiditus elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Fugu rubripes, and Toxoplasma gondii. A consensus of the results predicts a protein containing exceptionally long stretches of helix with a hydrophilic C-terminus. Phosphorylation site motifs were identified at two conserved positions. Possible SRY and GATA-1 binding motifs were found at conserved positions upstream of the mosquito genes. The location of A. stephensi Dox-A2 was determined by in situ hybridization at 34D on chromosome arm 3R. It is in a conserved gene cluster with respect to the other insects. However, the A. stephensi cluster contains a gene showing significant sequence identity to human and pigeon carnitine acetyltransferase genes, therefore showing divergence with the distal end of the D. melanogaster cluster. "
negative,"Leveraging genomic databases: from an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line to the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae via the Drosophila genome project. An important justification for genome sequencing efforts is the anticipation that data from model organisms will provide a framework for the more rapid analysis of other, less studied genomes. In this investigation, we sequenced an internal region of 25 amino acids from a 52 kDa protein that was differentially expressed in 20-hydroxyecdysone-treated Aedes albopictus cells in culture. Within the GenBank non-mouse and non-human expressed sequence tag (EST) database, this ""Aedes peptide"" uncovered a putative homology to hypothetical translation products from Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The hypothetical translation product from D. melanogaster, which included 462 amino acids, uncovered five expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. When the Anopheles ESTs were aligned against the hypothetical Drosophila protein, we found that in aggregate they covered 324 amino acids, with gaps measuring 19, 30, and 87 amino acids. To approximate the complete amino acid sequence, gaps between translation products from Anopheles ESTs were replaced with corresponding amino acids from Drosophila to arrive at a calculated mass of 51 104 and a pI of 5.84 for the mosquito protein, consistent with the position of the Ae. albopictus protein on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Finally, tandem mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of the 52 kDa Ae. albopictus protein revealed 33 peptides with masses within 1 Dalton of those predicted from an in silico digestion of the reconstructed Anophleles protein. In addition to providing the first direct evidence that a hypothetical protein in Drosophila is in fact translated, this analysis provides a general approach for maximizing recovery, from existing databases, of information that can facilitate prioritization of efforts among several candidate proteins. "
positive,"The beta2-tubulin gene from three tephritid fruit fly species and use of its promoter for sperm marking. To isolate testis-specific regulatory DNA that could be used in genetically transformed insect pest species to improve their biological control, beta2-tubulin genes and their proximal genomic DNA were isolated from three economically important tephritid pest species, Anastrepha suspensa, Anastrepha ludens, and Bactrocera dorsalis. Gene isolation was first attempted by degenerate PCR on an A. suspensa adult male testes cDNA library, which fortuitously isolated the 2.85 kb beta1-tubulin gene that encodes a 447 amino acid polypeptide. Subsequent PCR using 5' and 3' RACE generated the 1.4 kb Asbeta2-tubulin gene that encodes a 446 amino acid polypeptide. Using primers to conserved sequences, the highly similar A. ludens and B. dorsalis beta2-tubulin genes, encoding identical amino acid sequences, were then isolated. To verify Asbeta2-tubulin gene identification based on gene expression, qRT-PCR showed that Asbeta2-tubulin transcript was most abundant in pupal and adult males, and specific to the testes. This was further tested in transformants having the DsRed.T3 reporter gene regulated by the Asbeta2-tubulin 1.3 kb promoter region. Fluorescent protein was specifically expressed in testes from third instar larvae to adults, and fluorescent sperm could be detected in the spermathecae of non-transgenic females mated to transgenic males.To confirm these matings, a PCR protocol was developed specific to the transgenic sperm DNA. "
negative,"Genome editing in Bombyx mori: New opportunities for silkworm functional genomics and the sericulture industry. In recent years, research in life sciences has been remarkably revolutionized owing to the establishment, development and application of genome editing technologies. Genome editing has not only accelerated fundamental research but has also shown promising applications in agricultural breeding and therapy. In particular, the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology has become an indispensable tool in molecular biology owing to its high efficacy and simplicity. Genome editing tools have also been established in silkworm (Bombyx mori), a model organism of Lepidoptera insects with high economic importance. This has remarkably improved the level and scope of silkworm research and could reveal new mechanisms or targets in basic entomology and pest management studies. In this review, we summarize the progress and potential of genome editing in silkworm and its applications in functional genomic studies for generating novel genetic materials. "
negative,"Genome landscape and evolutionary plasticity of chromosomes in malaria mosquitoes. BACKGROUND: Nonrandom distribution of rearrangements is a common feature of eukaryotic chromosomes that is not well understood in terms of genome organization and evolution. In the major African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, polymorphic inversions are highly nonuniformly distributed among five chromosomal arms and are associated with epidemiologically important adaptations. However, it is not clear whether the genomic content of the chromosomal arms is associated with inversion polymorphism and fixation rates. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of chromosomal inversions, we created a physical map for an Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, and compared it with the genome of An. gambiae. We also developed and deployed novel Bayesian statistical models to analyze genome landscapes in individual chromosomal arms An. gambiae. Here, we demonstrate that, despite the paucity of inversion polymorphisms on the X chromosome, this chromosome has the fastest rate of inversion fixation and the highest density of transposable elements, simple DNA repeats, and GC content. The highly polymorphic and rapidly evolving autosomal 2R arm had overrepresentation of genes involved in cellular response to stress supporting the role of natural selection in maintaining adaptive polymorphic inversions. In addition, the 2R arm had the highest density of regions involved in segmental duplications that clustered in the breakpoint-rich zone of the arm. In contrast, the slower evolving 2L, 3R, and 3L, arms were enriched with matrix-attachment regions that potentially contribute to chromosome stability in the cell nucleus. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: These results highlight fundamental differences in evolutionary dynamics of the sex chromosome and autosomes and revealed the strong association between characteristics of the genome landscape and rates of chromosomal evolution. We conclude that a unique combination of various classes of genes and repetitive DNA in each arm, rather than a single type of repetitive element, is likely responsible for arm-specific rates of rearrangements. "
negative,"Re-thinking the social ladder approach for elucidating the evolution and molecular basis of insect societies. The evolution of large insect societies is a major evolutionary transition that occurred in the long-extinct ancestors of termites, ants, corbiculate bees, and vespid wasps. Researchers have long used 'social ladder thinking': assuming progressive stepwise phenotypic evolution and asserting that extant species with simple societies (e.g. some halictid bees) represent the ancestors of species with complex societies, and thus provide insight into general early steps of eusocial evolution. We discuss how this is inconsistent with data and modern evolutionary 'tree thinking'. Phylogenetic comparative methods with broad sampling provide the best means to make rigorous inferences about ancestral traits and evolutionary transitions that occurred within each lineage, and to determine whether consistent phenotypic and genomic changes occurred across independent lineages. "
negative,"The genome of a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori. Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, is a major insect model for research, and the first lepidopteran for which draft genome sequences became available in 2004. Two independent data sets from whole-genome shotgun sequencing were merged and assembled together with newly obtained fosmid- and BAC-end sequences. The remarkably improved new assembly is presented here. The 8.5-fold sequence coverage of an estimated 432 Mb genome was assembled into scaffolds with an N50 size of approximately 3.7 Mb; the largest scaffold was 14.5 million base pairs. With help of a high-density SNP linkage map, we anchored 87% of the scaffold sequences to all 28 chromosomes. A particular feature was the high repetitive sequence content estimated to be 43.6% and that consisted mainly of transposable elements. We predicted 14,623 gene models based on a GLEAN-based algorithm, a more accurate prediction than the previous gene models for this species. Over three thousand silkworm genes have no homologs in other insect or vertebrate genomes. Some insights into gene evolution and into characteristic biological processes are presented here and in other papers in this issue. The massive silk production correlates with the existence of specific tRNA clusters, and of several sericin genes assembled in a cluster. The silkworm's adaptation to feeding on mulberry leaves, which contain toxic alkaloids, is likely linked to the presence of new-type sucrase genes, apparently acquired from bacteria. The silkworm genome also revealed the cascade of genes involved in the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway, and a large number of cuticular protein genes. "
negative,"Novel sex pheromone desaturases in the genomes of corn borers generated through gene duplication and retroposon fusion. The biosynthesis of female moth sex pheromone blends is controlled by a number of different enzymes, many of which are encoded by members of multigene families. One such multigene family, the acyl-CoA desaturases, is composed of certain genes that function as key players in moth sex pheromone biosynthesis. Although much is known regarding the function of some of these genes, very little is known regarding how novel genes have evolved within this family and how this might impact the establishment of new sex pheromone blends within a species. We have discovered that several cryptic Delta11 and Delta14 desaturase genes exist in the genomes of the European and Asian corn borers (Ostrinia nubilalis and Ostrinia furnacalis, respectively). Furthermore, an entirely novel class of desaturase gene has arisen in the Ostrinia lineage and is derived from duplication of the Delta11 desaturase gene and subsequent fusion with a retroposon. Interestingly, the genes have been maintained over relatively long evolutionary time periods in corn borer genomes, and they have not been recognizably pseudogenized, suggesting that they maintain functional integrity. The existence of cryptic desaturase genes in moth genomes indicates that the evolution of moth sex pheromone desaturases in general is much more complex than previously recognized. "
positive,"Circadian clock genes link photoperiodic signals to lipid accumulation during diapause preparation in the diapause-destined female cabbage beetles Colaphellus bowringi. Many organisms have evolved a series of adaptions, such as dormancy or diapause in insects that enable them to withstand seasonally adverse conditions. In insects, photoperiodic signals received during the diapause induction phase have irreversible effect on diapause initiation. Insects continue to be exposed to diapause-inducing photoperiod after the diapause induction phase during diapause preparation before they enter diapause. However, how photoperiodic signals experienced during the diapause preparation phase (DPP) regulate diapause remains largely unclear. In this paper, we investigate this in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi. The cabbage beetle is in many respects an ideal experimental model in which to investigate the effect of photoperiodic signals on the DPP because it has facultative reproductive diapause induced by long-day length and has differentiable diapause induction and preparation phases. We found that the lipid content of female cabbage beetles decreased after diapause-destined (DD) individuals were exposed to a diapause-inhibiting photoperiod during the DPP. Two circadian clock negative regulators, per and tim, were probably involved in the photoperiodic response of beetles during the DPP. Per and tim presented obvious oscillation of circadian rhythm and photoperiodic response during the DPP in DD females and knock-down of these genes in DD females caused their lipid content to decrease. Per and tim probably promote lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of genes that regulate lipogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, decreased lipid accumulation caused by exposure to different photoperiods during the DPP was independent of juvenile hormone. In summary, these results suggest that photoperiodic signals received during the DPP influence lipid accumulation in DD insects. DD insects still have some ability to monitor photoperiodic changes during the DPP and per and tim are probably involved in regulating physiological responses to photoperiodic signals during diapause preparation. These results shed light on the relationship between photoperiodic signals and diapause preparation, and may provide new insights on both how to better utilize insects as resources and for pest management.

negative,"A high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of a generalist herbivore, Trichoplusia ni. The cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, is a globally distributed highly polyphagous herbivore and an important agricultural pest. T. ni has evolved resistance to various chemical insecticides, and is one of the only two insect species that have evolved resistance to the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in agricultural systems and has been selected for resistance to baculovirus infections. We report a 333-Mb high-quality T. ni genome assembly, which has N50 lengths of scaffolds and contigs of 4.6 Mb and 140 Kb, respectively, and contains 14,384 protein-coding genes. High-density genetic maps were constructed to anchor 305 Mb (91.7%) of the assembly to 31 chromosomes. Comparative genomic analysis of T. ni with Bombyx mori showed enrichment of tandemly duplicated genes in T. ni in families involved in detoxification and digestion, consistent with the broad host range of T. ni. High levels of genome synteny were found between T. ni and other sequenced lepidopterans. However, genome synteny analysis of T. ni and the T. ni derived cell line High Five (Hi5) indicated extensive genome rearrangements in the cell line. These results provided the first genomic evidence revealing the high instability of chromosomes in lepidopteran cell lines known from karyotypic observations. The high-quality T. ni genome sequence provides a valuable resource for research in a broad range of areas including fundamental insect biology, insect-plant interactions and co-evolution, mechanisms and evolution of insect resistance to chemical and biological pesticides, and technology development for insect pest management.

negative,"The draft genome sequence of Arsenophonus nasoniae, son-killer bacterium of Nasonia vitripennis, reveals genes associated with virulence and symbiosis. Four percent of female Nasonia vitripennis carry the son-killer bacterium Arsenophonus nasoniae, a microbe with notably different biology from other inherited parasites and symbionts. In this paper, we examine a draft genome sequence of the bacterium for open reading frames (ORFs), structures and pathways involved in interactions with its insect host. The genome data suggest that A. nasoniae carries multiple type III secretion systems, and an array of toxin and virulence genes found in Photorhabdus, Yersinia and other gammaproteobacteria. Of particular note are ORFs similar to those known to affect host innate immune functioning in other bacteria, and four ORFs related to pro-apoptotic exotoxins. The genome sequences for both A. nasoniae and its Nasonia host are useful tools for examining functional genomic interactions of microbial survival in hostile immune environments, and mechanisms of passage through gut epithelia, in a whole organism context.

positive,"Two delta class glutathione S-transferases involved in the detoxification of malathion in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). BACKGROUND: The oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a widespread agricultural pest, has evolved resistance to many insecticides, including organophosphorus compounds. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in xenobiotic detoxification and insecticide resistance in many insects. However, the role of delta class GSTs in detoxifying malathion in B. dorsalis is unknown. Here, we evaluated the roles of two delta class GSTs in malathion detoxification in this species. RESULTS: Two delta class GSTs genes, BdGSTd1 and BdGSTd10, were characterized in B. dorsalis. They were highly expressed in 5-day-old adults, as well as in midgut and Malpighian tubules. Upon malathion exposure, the two genes were upregulated by 2.63- and 2.85-fold, respectively. Injection of double-stranded RNA targeting BdGSTd1 or BdGSTd10 significantly reduced their mRNA levels in adults and also significantly increased adult susceptibility to malathion. The expression of these two GSTs in Escherichia coli helped the host to endure malathion stress at a concentration of 10 µg mL-1 according to a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses indicated that malathion could be significantly depleted by the two delta GSTs. The role of BdGSTd10 in malathion sequestration was also discussed. CONCLUSION: BdGSTd1 and BdGSTd10 play important roles in the detoxification of malathion in B. dorsalis. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Imaginal discs--a new source of chromosomes for genome mapping of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary global vector for dengue and yellow fever viruses. Sequencing of the Ae. aegypti genome has stimulated research in vector biology and insect genomics. However, the current genome assembly is highly fragmented with only ~31% of the genome being assigned to chromosomes. A lack of a reliable source of chromosomes for physical mapping has been a major impediment to improving the genome assembly of Ae. aegypti. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we demonstrate the utility of mitotic chromosomes from imaginal discs of 4(th) instar larva for cytogenetic studies of Ae. aegypti. High numbers of mitotic divisions on each slide preparation, large sizes, and reproducible banding patterns of the individual chromosomes simplify cytogenetic procedures. Based on the banding structure of the chromosomes, we have developed idiograms for each of the three Ae. aegypti chromosomes and placed 10 BAC clones and a 18S rDNA probe to precise chromosomal positions. CONCLUSION: The study identified imaginal discs of 4(th) instar larva as a superior source of mitotic chromosomes for Ae. aegypti. The proposed approach allows precise mapping of DNA probes to the chromosomal positions and can be utilized for obtaining a high-quality genome assembly of the yellow fever mosquito. "
positive,"Characterization of the novel role of NinaB orthologs from Bombyx mori and Tribolium castaneum. Carotenoids can be enzymatically converted to apocarotenoids by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases. Insect genomes encode only one member of this ancestral enzyme family. We cloned and characterized the ninaB genes from the silk worm (Bombyx mori) and the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). We expressed BmNinaB and TcNinaB in E. coli and analyzed their biochemical properties. Both enzymes catalyzed a conversion of carotenoids into cis-retinoids. The enzymes catalyzed a combined trans to cis isomerization at the C11, C12 double bond and oxidative cleavage reaction at the C15, C15' bond of the carotenoid carbon backbone. Analyses of the spatial and temporal expression patterns revealed that ninaB genes were differentially expressed during the beetle and moth life cycles with high expression in reproductive organs. In Bombyx mori, ninaB was almost exclusively expressed in female reproductive organs of the pupa and adult. In Tribolium castaneum, low expression was found in reproductive organs of females but high expressions in male reproductive organs of the pupa and imagoes. We performed RNAi experiments to characterize the role of NinaB in insect reproduction. We observed that RNAi treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of BmninaB and TcninaB and reduced the egg laying capacity of both insects. Together, our study revealed that NinaB's unique enzymatic properties are well conserved among insects and implicate NinaB function in insect reproduction. "
negative,"Genomic organization and immune regulation of the defensin gene from the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. The defensin gene from the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, is present as a single copy per haploid genome. Two exons, encoding a 102 residue preprodefensin, are separated by a 105 bp intron bounded by consensus splice sites. The upstream regulatory sequence includes a TATA box, arthropod initiator and numerous motifs homologous to insect and mammalian immune response elements. This promoter is capable of upregulation by immune challenge in cultured cells and activity is further stimulated by Gambif1, a mosquito Rel protein known to translocate to the nucleus and bind NF-kappa B sites in target promoters. Activity is inhibited by p50, a mammalian Rel protein that competitively binds NF-kappa B sites, and virtually abolished by p40, an avian I kappa B protein that inhibits nuclear translocation. "

negative,"An apoptosis-inhibiting baculovirus gene with a zinc finger-like motif. Spodoptera frugiperda SF-21 cells infected with Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus mutants which lack a functional p35 gene undergo apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death. To identify p35-homologous genes in other baculoviruses, A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA containing a deletion in p35 was cotransfected into SF-21 cells along with genomic DNAs from other baculoviruses. One of the viral DNAs which were able to rescue wild-type infection was from Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV). The CpGV gene responsible for the effect was mapped to a 1.6-kb SalI-SstI subclone of the SalI B fragment of CpGV. The sequence of the SalI-SstI subclone revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a polypeptide of 31 kDa which was sufficient to rescue wild-type infection; this gene was thus called iap (inhibitor of apoptosis). The predicted sequence of the IAP polypeptide exhibited no significant homology to P35 but contained a zinc finger-like motif which is also found in other genes with the potential to regulate apoptosis, including several mammalian proto-oncogenes and two insect genes involved in embryonic development. In the context of the viral genome, both iap and p35 were able to block apoptosis induced by actinomycin D, indicating that these genes act by blocking cellular apoptosis rather than by preventing viral stimulation of apoptosis. Several independent recombinant viruses derived from cotransfections with either the entire CpGV genome or the 1.6-kb subclone were characterized. "
