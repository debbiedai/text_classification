negative,"A small genomic region containing several loci required for gastrulation in Drosophila. Genetic screens in Drosophila designed to search for loci involved in gastrulation have identified four regions of the genome that are required zygotically for the formation of the ventral furrow. For three of these, the genes responsible for the mutant phenotypes have been found. We now describe a genetic characterization of the fourth region, which encompasses the cytogenetic interval 24C3-25B, and the mapping of genes involved in gastrulation in this region. We have determined the precise breakpoints of several existing deficiencies and have generated new deficiencies. Our results show that the region contains at least three different loci associated with gastrulation effects. One maternal effect gene involved in ventral furrow formation maps at 24F but could not be identified. For a second maternal effect gene which is required for germ band extension, we identify a candidate gene, CG31660, which encodes a G protein coupled receptor. Finally, one gene acts zygotically in ventral furrow formation and we identify it as Traf4. "
positive,"Genome-wide identification of chitin-binding proteins and characterization of BmCBP1 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The insect cuticle plays important roles in numerous physiological functions to protect the body from invasion of pathogens, physical injury and dehydration. In this report, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide search for genes encoding proteins with peritrophin A-type (ChtBD2) chitin-binding domain (CBD) in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. One of these genes, which encodes the cuticle protein BmCBP1, was additionally cloned, and its expression and location during the process of development and molting in B. mori were investigated. In total, 46 protein-coding genes were identified in the silkworm genome, including those encoding 15 cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with one CBD (CPAP1s), nine cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins with three CBD (CPAP3s), 15 peritrophic membrane proteins (PMPs), four chitinases, and three chitin deacetylases, which contained at least one ChtBD2 domain. Microarray analysis indicated that CPAP-encoding genes were widely expressed in various tissues, whereas PMP genes were highly expressed in the midgut. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that the cuticle protein BmCBP1 was highly expressed in the epidermis and head, particularly during molting and metamorphosis. An immunofluorescence study revealed that chitin co-localized with BmCBP1 at the epidermal surface during molting. Additionally, BmCBP1 was notably up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. These results provide a genome-level view of the chitin-binding protein in silkworm and suggest that BmCBP1 participates in the formation of the new cuticle during molting. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti BGSC 4C1, a typical strain with toxicity to Lepidoptera insects. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar alesti was used to control caterpillars from 1970s. Here we reported the complete genome of BGSC 4C1, the type strain of this serovar. It has a circular chromosome and six plasmids. The largest plasmid pBMB267 contains five insecticidal crystal protein genes (two copies of cry1Ae, cry1Gb, cry2Ab, and a novel cry1M-type gene) and three vegetative insecticidal protein genes (a novel binary toxin gene operon vip1-vip2 and vip3Aa). Besides, the strain also has many genes encodeing virulence factors, and some secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters involved in synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and bacteriocins. In addition, there is a poly γ-glutamate synthesis gene cluster, whose product is a candidate to control inflammasome-mediated disorders and potential in many other fields. "
negative,"Expansion of LINEs and species-specific DNA repeats drives genome expansion in Asian Gypsy Moths. Two subspecies of Asian gypsy moth (AGM), Lymantria dispar asiatica and L. dispar japonica, pose a serious alien invasive threat to North American forests. Despite decades of research on the ecology and biology of this pest, limited AGM-specific genomic resources are currently available. Here, we report on the genome sequences and functional content of these AGM subspecies. The genomes of L.d. asiatica and L.d. japonica are the largest lepidopteran genomes sequenced to date, totaling 921 and 999 megabases, respectively. Large genome size in these subspecies is driven by the accumulation of specific classes of repeats. Genome-wide metabolic pathway reconstructions suggest strong genomic signatures of energy-related pathways in both subspecies, dominated by metabolic functions related to thermogenesis. The genome sequences reported here will provide tools for probing the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic traits that are thought to enhance AGM invasiveness. "
negative,"Caste development and reproduction: a genome-wide analysis of hallmarks of insect eusociality. The honey bee queen and worker castes are a model system for developmental plasticity. We used established expressed sequence tag information for a Gene Ontology based annotation of genes that are differentially expressed during caste development. Metabolic regulation emerged as a major theme, with a caste-specific difference in the expression of oxidoreductases vs. hydrolases. Motif searches in upstream regions revealed group-specific motifs, providing an entry point to cis-regulatory network studies on caste genes. For genes putatively involved in reproduction, meiosis-associated factors came out as highly conserved, whereas some determinants of embryonic axes either do not have clear orthologs (bag of marbles, gurken, torso), or appear to be lacking (trunk) in the bee genome. Our results are the outcome of a first genome-based initiative to provide an annotated framework for trends in gene regulation during female caste differentiation (representing developmental plasticity) and reproduction. "
negative,"Isolation and characterization of a genomic clone for the gene of an insect molting enzyme, chitinase. Genomic clones for a chitinolytic enzyme were isolated from a library of Sau 3A digested DNA from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, using a previously isolated chitinase cDNA clone as a probe [Kramer et al., Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 23, 691-701 (1993)]. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot analysis of four genomic clones suggested that these are overlapping clones. Sequence analysis of the genomic clones and Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA also suggest that the M. sexta genome has only one chitinase gene detectable by the cDNA probe. This gene is organized into at least 11 exons in a region spanning > 11 kb. The sequenced M. sexta chitinase gene has a series of exons corresponding to identifiable structural / functional regions of the protein. Similarities in structure and organization between the M. sexta chitinase gene and chitinase genes from other sources are described. "
negative,"The genomics of insecticide resistance: insights from recent studies in African malaria vectors. Over 80% of the world's population is at risk from arthropod-vectored diseases, and arthropod crop pests are a significant threat to food security. Insecticides are our front-line response for controlling these disease vectors and pests, and consequently the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance is of global concern. Here we provide a brief overview of how genomics can be used to implement effective insecticide resistance management (IRM), with a focus on recent advances in the study of Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria in Africa. These advances unlock the potential for a predictive form of IRM, allowing tractable feedback for stakeholders, where the latest field data and well parameterised models can maximise the lifetime and effectiveness of available insecticides. "
negative,"Chromosomal deletions mediated by CRISPR / Cas9 in Helicoverpa armigera. Helicoverpa armigera, cotton bollworm, is one of the most disastrous pests worldwide, threatening various food and economic crops. Functional genomic tools may provide efficient approaches for its management. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, dependent on a single guide RNA (sgRNA), has been used to induce indels for targeted mutagenesis in cotton bollworm. However, genomic deletions may be more desirable to disrupt the function of noncoding genes or regulatory sequences. By injecting two sgRNAs with Cas9 protein targeting different exons, we obtained predictable genomic deletions of several hundred bases. We achieved this type of modification with different combinations of sgRNA pairs, including HaCad and HaABCC2. Our finding indicated that CRISPR / Cas9 can be used as an efficient tool to engineer genomes with chromosomal deletion in H. armigera. "
negative,"Disease vectors in the era of next generation sequencing. Almost 20 % of all infectious human diseases are vector borne and, together, are responsible for over one million deaths per annum. Over the past decade, the decreasing costs of massively parallel sequencing technologies have facilitated the agnostic interrogation of insect vector genomes, giving medical entomologists access to an ever-expanding volume of high-quality genomic and transcriptomic data. In this review, we highlight how genomics resources have provided new insights into the physiology, behavior, and evolution of human disease vectors within the context of the global health landscape. "
negative,"Rapid evolution in insect pests: the importance of space and time in population genomics studies. Pest species in agroecosystems often exhibit patterns of rapid evolution to environmental and human-imposed selection pressures. Although the role of adaptive processes is well accepted, few insect pests have been studied in detail and most research has focused on selection at insecticide resistance candidate genes. Emerging genomic datasets provide opportunities to detect and quantify selection in insect pest populations, and address long-standing questions about mechanisms underlying rapid evolutionary change. We examine the strengths of recent studies that stratify population samples both in space (along environmental gradients and comparing ancestral vs. derived populations) and in time (using chronological sampling, museum specimens and comparative phylogenomics), resulting in critical insights on evolutionary processes, and providing new directions for studying pests in agroecosystems. "
negative,"Genomic data reveal high conservation but divergent evolutionary pattern of Polycomb / Trithorax group genes in arthropods. Epigenetic gene control is maintained by chromatin-associated Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) genes, which act antagonistically via the interplay between PcG and TrxG regulation to generate silenced or permissive transcriptional states. In this study, we searched for PcG / TrxG genes in 180 arthropod genomes, covering all the sequenced arthropod genomes at the time of conducting this study, to perform a global investigation of PcG / TrxG genes in a phylogenetic frame. Results of ancestral state reconstruction analysis revealed that the ancestor of arthropod species has an almost complete repertoire of PcG / TrxG genes, and most of these genes were seldom lost above order level. The domain diversity analysis indicated that the PcG / TrxG genes show variable extent of domain structure changes; some of these changes could be associated with lineage-specific events. The likelihood ratio tests for selection pressure detected a number of PcG / TrxG genes which underwent episodic positive selection on the branch leading to the insects with holometabolous development. These results suggest that, despite their high conservation across arthropod species, different members of PcG / TrxG genes showed considerable differences in domain structure and sequence divergence in arthropod evolution. Our cross species comparisons using large-scale genomic data provide insights into divergent evolutionary pattern on highly conserved genes in arthropods. "
negative,"Implication for DNA methylation involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). DNA methylation exerts extensive impacts on gene expression of various living organisms exposed to environmental variation. However, little is known whether DNA methylation is involved in the host transfer of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a worldwide destructive pest of crucifers. In this study, we found that P. xylostella genome exhibited a relatively low level of DNA methylation on the basis of the CpG O / E prediction and experimental validation. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between the stage-specific expressions of PxDNMT1 and DNA methylation levels (5mC content). Particularly, high levels of DNA methylation and gene expression of PxDNMT1 were observed in eggs and mature females of P. xylostella. After host transfer of P. xylostella from Raphanus sativus to Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified some potential genomic loci that might have changed methylation levels. Using the method of fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP), we also found the corresponding genes primarily involved in neural system and signaling. The expressions of six candidate genes were verified by qRT-PCR. One of the genes, Px009600, might be regulated by a DNA methylation-mediated mechanism in response to host transfer. Our study provides evidence for a functional system of DNA methylation in P. xylostella and its possible role in adaptation during host transfer. Further studies should examine methylation as responsive factors to different host plants and environmental cues in insect pests. "
positive,"Biochemical characterization of three midgut chitin deacetylases of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori. Peritrophic membrane (PM) is a chitin and protein-containing extracellular matrix that lines the midgut in most insect species, functioning as a barrier to exogenous toxins and pathogens. Midgut chitin deacetylases (CDAs) are chitin-modifying enzymes known to alter the mechanical property and permeability of PM. However, biochemical properties and specific roles of these enzymes remain elusive. In this study, the midgut-expressed CDAs (BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8) from Bombyx mori were cloned, recombinantly expressed and purified and their enzymatic activities toward PM chitin were determined. Of the three enzymes, BmCDA7 exhibited the highest activity (0.284 μmol / min / μmol), while BmCDA8 showed lower activity of 0.061 μmol / min / μmol. BmCDA6 was inactive towards PM chitin. Gene expression patterns indicated that although all three CDA genes were specifically expressed in the anterior midgut, they differed in their temporal expression patterns. BmCDA6 was expressed almost exclusively at the mid-molt stage, the stage when the PM was thick and with multiple chitin layers. Unlike BmCDA6, high expression levels of BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 were observed only at the feeding stage, the stage when the PM is thin and with fewer chitin layers. The different gene expression patterns and biochemical characteristics provide new information about the functional specialization among BmCDA6, BmCDA7 and BmCDA8 proteins. "
positive,"The cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. Members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel (cysLGIC) superfamily mediate chemical neurotransmission and are studied extensively as potential targets of drugs used to treat neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Insect cys-loop LGICs also have central roles in the nervous system and are targets of highly successful insecticides. Here, we describe the cysLGIC superfamily of the parasitoid wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is emerging as a highly useful model organism and is deployed as a biological control of insect pests. The wasp superfamily consists of 26 genes, which is the largest insect cysLGIC superfamily characterized, whereas Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum have 23, 21 and 24, respectively. As with Apis, Drosophila and Tribolium, Nasonia possesses ion channels predicted to be gated by acetylcholine, gamma-amino butyric acid, glutamate and histamine, as well as orthologues of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to other insects, wasp cysLGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing and RNA A-to-I editing, which may also serve to generate species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on N. vitripennis enhance our understanding of cysLGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the study of their function in the wasp model, as well as for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species. "
negative,"Comparative genomics of insect-symbiotic bacteria: influence of host environment on microbial genome composition. Commensal symbionts, thought to be intermediary amid obligate mutualists and facultative parasites, offer insight into forces driving the evolutionary transition into mutualism. Using macroarrays developed for a close relative, Escherichia coli, we utilized a heterologous array hybridization approach to infer the genomic compositions of a clade of bacteria that have recently established symbiotic associations: Sodalis glossinidius with the tsetse fly (Diptera, Glossina spp.) and Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE) with the rice weevil (Coleoptera, Sitophilus oryzae). Functional biologies within their hosts currently reflect different forms of symbiotic associations. Their hosts, members of distant insect taxa, occupy distinct ecological niches and have evolved to survive on restricted diets of blood for tsetse and cereal for the rice weevil. Comparison of genome contents between the two microbes indicates statistically significant differences in the retention of genes involved in carbon compound catabolism, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and transport. The greatest reductions have occurred in carbon catabolism, membrane proteins, and cell structure-related genes for Sodalis and in genes involved in cellular processes (i.e., adaptations towards cellular conditions) for SOPE. Modifications in metabolic pathways, in the form of functional losses complementing particularities in host physiology and ecology, may have occurred upon initial entry from a free-living to a symbiotic state. It is possible that these adaptations, streamlining genomes, act to make a free-living state no longer feasible for the harnessed microbe. "
negative,"Body lice and head lice (Anoplura: Pediculidae) have the smallest genomes of any hemimetabolous insect reported to date. The human body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus L. (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is a vector of several diseases, including louse-borne epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, and trench fever, whereas the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Anoplura: Pediculidae), is more a pest of social concern. Sequencing of the body louse genome has recently been proposed and undertaken by National Human Genome Research Institute. One of the first steps in understanding an organism's genome is to determine its genome size. Here, using flow cytometry determinations, we present evidence that body louse genome size is 104.7 + / - 1.4 Mb for females and 108.3 + / - 1.1 Mb for males. Our results suggest that head lice also have a small genome size, of similar size to the body louse. Thus, Pediculus lice have one of the smallest genome sizes known in insects, suggesting it may be a suitable choice as a minimal hemimetabolous genome. "
positive,"Expression of a novel member of the odorant-binding protein gene family in Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae). We previously showed that gene expression in the midgut of female Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was altered after ingestion of a bloodmeal and some of the expressed cDNAs showed stage-, sex-, and tissue-specific expression. One of these expressed cDNAs, CN G11B, is here shown to be similar to members of a gene family that encodes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 is a cDNA fragment of 721 bp, is incomplete at the 5'-end, and contains a canonical polyadenylic acid tail signal sequence in the 103-bp 3'-untranslated region. Translation of CN G11B.1 provides a putative protein product of 207 amino acids. GenBank tblastx, VectorBase, and Pfam database searches showed identity to hypothetical proteins from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (86%) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (55%). These proteins have structural motifs similar to those found in the gene family that includes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 putative protein has two of the six cysteines that are highly conserved in most invertebrate odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 expression increased in thoraces (6-12 h) and in abdomens (3-48 h) of blood fed female Cx. nigripalpus but was not detected in RNA from heads, indicating a possible role in both chemoreception and blood feeding. "
positive,"Molecular diversity of PBAN family peptides from fire ants. The PBAN / Pyrokinin peptide family is a major neuropeptide family characterized with a common FXPRLamide in the C-termini. These peptides are ubiquitously distributed in the Insecta and are involved in many essential endocrinal functions, e.g., pheromone production. Previous work demonstrated the localization of PBAN in the fire ant central nervous system, and identified a new family of PBAN from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. In this study, we identified five more PBAN / Pyrokinin genes from S. geminata, S. richteri, S. pergandii, S. carolinensis, and a hybrid of S. invicta and S. richteri. The gene sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these species and hybrid, which compared well to the morphologically defined fire ant subgroup complexes. The putative PBAN and other peptides were determined from the amino acid sequences of the PBAN / pyrokinin genes. We summarized all known insect PBAN family neuropeptides, and for the first time constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the full amino acid sequences translated from representative PBAN cDNAs. The PBAN / pyrokinin gene is well conserved in Insecta and probably extends into the Arthropod phylum; however, translated pre-propeptides may vary and functional diversity may be retained, lost, or modified during the evolutionary process. "
negative,"Transient expression of a promoter-reporter construct in differentiated adult salivary glands and embryos of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Vector-borne pathogens develop in close association with specific tissues in their insect hosts. Efforts are being made to characterize insect genes that are expressed in tissues that have important roles in pathogen propagation. Successful transfection and expression of exogenous genes in terminally differentiated tissues of insects has previously proven difficult. Here we report a method that should allow the analysis of genes that are expressed in adult tissues and organs. Transient expression assays have been developed using the salivary glands of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which can now be used to analyze salivary gland-specific promoter sequences. A liposome-based transfection reagent was used to transfect cultured adult salivary glands with a DNA construct carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock 70 promoter. Luciferase activity was detected in glands 18-20 hr post-transfection. This assay can now be used to determine the regulatory activity of other putative promoter sequences from salivary gland-specific genes. Alternatively, the assay may be used to study the effect of recombinant gene expression on parasite invasion and development. In addition, transient expression of gene constructs in embryos is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing genes that are expressed at this stage of the mosquito life cycle. "
positive,"Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in fruit fly Bactrocera minax. BACKGROUND: Vision plays a critical role in host location and oviposition behavior for herbivorous insects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying visual regulation in host recognition and oviposition site selection in insects remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the key visual genes that are linked to the host plant location of the fruit fly, Bactrocera minax. RESULTS: Using a host specialist fruit fly, B. minax, which lays eggs only into immature green citrus fruit, we undertook behavioral, transcriptomic, and RNAi research to identify the molecular basis for host fruit color recognition. In laboratory and field assays we found that adults prefer green over other colors, and this preference is significantly increased in sexually mature over immature flies. Furthermore, we identified that the Rh6 gene, responsible for green spectral sensitivity, has elevated expression in mature flies over immature flies. RNAi suppression of Rh6 eliminated the preference for green, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of eggs laid by B. minax in green unripe citrus. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Rh6 gene modulates the visual mechanism of host utilization in B. minax, providing a genetic basis for visual host location in a non-model insect herbivore. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

negative,"Many roads to resistance: how invertebrates adapt to Bt toxins. The Cry family of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal and nematicidal proteins constitutes a valuable source of environmentally benign compounds for the control of insect pests and disease agents. An understanding of Cry toxin resistance at a molecular level will be critical to the long-term utility of this technology; it may also shed light on basic mechanisms used by other bacterial toxins that target specific organisms or cell types. Selection and cross-resistance studies have confirmed that genetic adaptation can elicit varying patterns of Cry toxin resistance, which has been associated with deficient protoxin activation by host proteases, and defective Cry toxin-binding cell surface molecules, such as cadherins, aminopeptidases and glycolipids. Recent work also suggests Cry toxin resistance may be induced in invertebrates as an active immune response. The use of model invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as advances in insect genomics, are likely to accelerate efforts to clone Cry toxin resistance genes and come to a detailed and broad understanding of Cry toxin resistance. "
negative,"Genome-wide microarray screening for Bombyx mori genes related to transmitting the determination outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs. The bivoltine silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) exhibits a maternally controlled embryonic diapause. Maternal silkworms decide whether to lay diapause or nondiapause eggs depending on environmental factors such as the temperature and photoperiod during the egg and larval stages, and then induce diapause eggs during the pupal stage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism that conveys the outcome of whether to produce diapause or nondiapause eggs from the egg or larval stages to the pupal stage. This study used microarray analysis to investigate differentially expressed genes in the larval brains of diapause- and nondiapause-egg producers, to which bivoltine silkworms were destined by thermal or photic stimulation during the egg stage. The cytochrome P450 18a1 and Krüppel homolog 1 genes were upregulated in producers of diapause eggs compared with those of nondiapause eggs under both experimental conditions. Cytochrome P450 18a1 encodes a key enzyme for steroid hormone inactivation and Krüppel homolog 1 is an early juvenile hormone-inducible gene that mediates the repression of metamorphosis. The upregulation of these genes during the larval stage might be involved in the signaling pathway that transmits information about the diapause program from the egg stage to the pupal stage in the silkworm. "
positive,"Identification and functional characterisation of a novel N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid metabolising cytochrome P450, CYP9Q6, from the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Recent work has shown that two bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5, are important biochemical determinants of sensitivity to neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we report the characterisation of a third P450 gene CYP9Q6, previously mis-annotated in the genome of B. terrestris, encoding an enzyme that metabolises the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids thiacloprid and acetamiprid with high efficiency. The genomic location and complete ORF of CYP9Q6 was corroborated by PCR and its metabolic activity characterised in vitro by expression in an insect cell line. CYP9Q6 metabolises both thiacloprid and acetamiprid more rapidly than the previously reported CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5. We further demonstrate a direct, in vivo correlation between the expression of the CYP9Q6 enzyme in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and an increased tolerance to thiacloprid and acetamiprid. We conclude that CYP9Q6 is an efficient metaboliser of N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids and likely plays a key role in the high tolerance of B. terrestris to these insecticides. "
negative,"Butterfly genomics eclosing. Technological and conceptual advances of the last decade have led to an explosion of genomic data and the emergence of new research avenues. Evolutionary and ecological functional genomics, with its focus on the genes that affect ecological success and adaptation in natural populations, benefits immensely from a phylogenetically widespread sampling of biological patterns and processes. Among those organisms outside established model systems, butterflies offer exceptional opportunities for multidisciplinary research on the processes generating and maintaining variation in ecologically relevant traits. Here we highlight research on wing color pattern variation in two groups of Nymphalid butterflies, the African species Bicyclus anynana (subfamily Satyrinae) and species of the South American genus Heliconius (subfamily Heliconiinae), which are emerging as important systems for studying the nature and origins of functional diversity. Growing genomic resources including genomic and cDNA libraries, dense genetic maps, high-density gene arrays, and genetic transformation techniques are extending current gene mapping and expression profiling analysis and enabling the next generation of research questions linking genes, development, form, and fitness. Efforts to develop such resources in Bicyclus and Heliconius underscore the general challenges facing the larger research community and highlight the need for a community-wide effort to extend ongoing functional genomic research on butterflies. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome of Diaphania indica(saunders) (Lepidoptera: Pyraloidea) and implications for its phylogeny. The cucumber moth, Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepipdoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important insect pest of cucurbits and is widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Herein, we obtained entire mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of D. indica using polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing method. The complete mitogenome of D. indica is 15,367bp long, including 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and an A+T rich element. Both the AT skew and GC skew are slightly negative in the newly sequenced mitogenome. All of the 12 PCGs initiate with canonical start codon (ATN), except for coxI that initiate with CGA. The A+T rich element of D. indica is 467bp long and contains many features common to Pyraloidea insects. In addition, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the eight superfamiles of lepidopterans by employing Neighbor joining (NJ) and Maximum likelihood (ML) methods, and both yielded identical topologies. The phylogeny results supported the monophyly of lepidopteran superfamilies. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree showed that D. indica belongs to the Pyraloidea superfamily. "
negative,"A picorna-like virus from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta: initial discovery, genome sequence, and characterization. We report the first discovery and genome sequence of a virus infecting the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. The 8026 nucleotide, polyadenylated, RNA genome encoded two large open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), flanked and separated by 27, 223, and 171 nucleotide untranslated regions, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 5' proximal ORF1 (nucleotides 28 to 4218) exhibited significant identity and possessed consensus sequences characteristic of the helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence motifs from picornaviruses, picorna-like viruses, comoviruses, caliciviruses, and sequiviruses. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 3' proximal ORF2 (nucleotides 4390-7803) showed similarity to structural proteins in picorna-like viruses, especially the acute bee paralysis virus. Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained samples from virus-infected fire ants revealed isometric particles with a diameter of 31 nm, consistent with Picornaviridae. A survey for the fire ant virus from areas around Florida revealed a pattern of fairly widespread distribution. Among 168 nests surveyed, 22.9% were infected. The virus was found to infect all fire ant caste members and developmental stages, including eggs, early (1st-2nd) and late (3rd-4th) instars, worker pupae, workers, sexual pupae, alates ( male symbol and female symbol ), and queens. The virus, tentatively named S. invicta virus (SINV-1), appears to belong to the picorna-like viruses. We did not observe any perceptible symptoms among infected nests in the field. However, in every case where an SINV-1-infected colony was excavated from the field with an inseminated queen and held in the laboratory, all of the brood in these colonies died within 3 months. "
negative,"The GH / IGF-I axis and longevity. Several converging lines of evidence obtained over the last years in a wide variety of experimental model organisms suggest that the ageing process is regulated by genes that encode proteins from the somatotroph axis: longevity genes like daf-2, which were identified using mutant Caenorhabditis elegans strains, turned out to be orthologues of the mammalian genes encoding insulin-like signalling cascade proteins. Transgenic flies with mutations in the corresponding insect genes showed a similar pattern of increased lifespan. Finally, mice with spontaneous mutations leading to pituitary hormone deficiency significantly outlived controls. While these and other genetic models suggest that the downregulation of the somatotroph axis can slow the ageing process, other results from studies using pharmacological administration of growth hormone suggest that such stimulating treatment can restore some of the phenotypic traits associated with youth. To better understand the role of the insulin-like receptors in mammalian lifespan regulation and ageing, we explored the phenotype of heterozygous IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) knockout mice. Compared with control littermates these mutants live longer without any obvious impairment of their health and physiology, except a reduced glucose tolerance that we observed in males. These IGF1R(+ / -) mutants were also more resistant to oxidative stress in vivo, and we identified a possible molecular pathway linking underphosphorylation of IGF-I receptors to the lack of activation of p66Shc, a protein capable of increasing resistance to oxidative stress through regulation of a set of downstream genes. These and other results suggest that in mammals too, lifespan can be increased by continuous, long-term downregulation of IGF signalling. Since growth hormone administration normally stimulates IGF production in tissues, the question arises whether the beneficial effects of GH, as reported by others, could be IGF independent. This hypothesis can be addressed, for example, by adequately combining existing transgenic mouse models. "
positive,"Isolation of diapause-regulated genes from the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis by suppressive subtractive hybridization. Subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH) was used to characterize the diapause transcriptome of the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. Through these efforts, we isolated 97 unique clones which were used as probes in northern hybridization to assess their expression during diapause. Of these, 17 were confirmed to be diapause upregulated and 1 was diapause downregulated, while 12 were shown to be unaffected by diapause in this species. The diapause upregulated genes fall into several broad categories including heat shock proteins, heavy metal responsive genes, neuropeptides, structural genes, regulatory elements, and several genes of unknown function. In combination with other large-scale analyses of gene expression during diapause, this study assists in the characterization of the S. crassipalpis diapause transcriptome, and begins to identify common elements involved in diapause across diverse taxa.

negative,"Identification of two arginases generated by alternative splicing in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. Here, we have cloned two arginase cDNAs from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The analysis of exon / intron structures showed that the two mRNAs named bmarg-r and bmarg-f were generated from a single gene by alternative usage of exons. The bmarg-r and bmarg-f were predicted to encode almost the same amino acid sequences, except that the latter had additional ten N-terminal residues. Recombinant bmARG-r and bmARG-f in Escherichia coli cell lysates were roughly similar to each other in enzymatic characteristics, which did not show large difference from those of arginases assayed by using tissue extracts. Differential RT-PCR experiments and tissue distribution analyses of arginase activity indicated that the bmarg-r gene is expressed in the male reproductive organs, especially in the glandula lacteola and vesicular seminalis, from which it is secreted to the seminal fluid and transferred to the female during copulation, whereas the bmarg-f gene is expressed in the larval and adult nonreproductive organs including the fat body and muscle, where the produced arginase proteins are considered to stay in the cells. Thus, the two silkworm arginase isoforms may have a difference in whether or not the product is excreted out of the cells in which it is synthesized. "
negative,"Extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice (Phthiraptera: Insecta). The arrangement of genes in the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of most insects is the same, or near-identical, to that inferred to be ancestral for insects. We sequenced the entire mt genome of the small pigeon louse, Campanulotes bidentatus compar, and part of the mt genomes of nine other species of lice. These species were from six families and the three main suborders of the order Phthiraptera. There was no variation in gene arrangement among species within a family but there was much variation in gene arrangement among the three suborders of lice. There has been an extraordinary number of gene rearrangements in the mitochondrial genomes of lice! "
negative,"Rice bean: a lesser known pulse with well-recognized potential. MAIN CONCLUSION: Required genetic resources for the improvement of agronomic, nutritional and economic value of rice bean are available in the world collection. International cooperative effort is required to utilize and conserve them. Rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi], a lesser known pulse among the Asiatic Vigna, has long been considered as a food security crop of small and marginal farmers of Southeast Asia. Considered as a nutritionally rich food and fodder, it is also a source of genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance including drought, soil acidity and storage pest. Although it spread from its centre of domestication in the Indo-China region to other parts around the world, it never became an important crop anywhere probably because of agronomic disadvantages. Crop improvement for determinate nature, good yield, less variable seed colour, pleasant organoleptic properties and lower antinutrients is required. Scanning of scientific literature indicates that genetic resources with desirable agronomic and nutritional traits exist within the current collection but are spread across countries. Genomic studies in the species indicate that except for insect resistance and aluminium toxicity tolerance, not much attention has been paid to decipher and utilize other stress tolerance and nutritional quality traits. Collaborative efforts towards improving farming, food, trade value and off-farm conservation of rice bean would not only help marginal farmers but will also help to preserve the yet to be explored genomic resources available in this sturdy pulse.

negative,"Sequencing of Culex quinquefasciatus establishes a platform for mosquito comparative genomics. Culex quinquefasciatus (the southern house mosquito) is an important mosquito vector of viruses such as West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as well as of nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. C. quinquefasciatus is one species within the Culex pipiens species complex and can be found throughout tropical and temperate climates of the world. The ability of C. quinquefasciatus to take blood meals from birds, livestock, and humans contributes to its ability to vector pathogens between species. Here, we describe the genomic sequence of C. quinquefasciatus: Its repertoire of 18,883 protein-coding genes is 22% larger than that of Aedes aegypti and 52% larger than that of Anopheles gambiae with multiple gene-family expansions, including olfactory and gustatory receptors, salivary gland genes, and genes associated with xenobiotic detoxification. "
negative,"Pheromone production in bark beetles. The first aggregation pheromone components from bark beetles were identified in 1966 as a mixture of ipsdienol, ipsenol and verbenol. Since then, a number of additional components have been identified as both aggregation and anti-aggregation pheromones, with many of them being monoterpenoids or derived from monoterpenoids. The structural similarity between the major pheromone components of bark beetles and the monoterpenes found in the host trees, along with the association of monoterpenoid production with plant tissue, led to the paradigm that most if not all bark beetle pheromone components were derived from host tree precursors, often with a simple hydroxylation producing the pheromone. In the 1990 s there was a paradigm shift as evidence for de novo biosynthesis of pheromone components began to accumulate, and it is now recognized that most bark beetle monoterpenoid aggregation pheromone components are biosynthesized de novo. The bark beetle aggregation pheromones are released from the frass, which is consistent with the isoprenoid aggregation pheromones, including ipsdienol, ipsenol and frontalin, being produced in midgut tissue. It appears that exo-brevocomin is produced de novo in fat body tissue, and that verbenol, verbenone and verbenene are produced from dietary α-pinene in fat body tissue. Combined biochemical, molecular and functional genomics studies in Ips pini yielded the discovery and characterization of the enzymes that convert mevalonate pathway intermediates to pheromone components, including a novel bifunctional geranyl diphosphate synthase / myrcene synthase, a cytochrome P450 that hydroxylates myrcene to ipsdienol, and an oxidoreductase that interconverts ipsdienol and ipsdienone to achieve the appropriate stereochemistry of ipsdienol for pheromonal activity. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes and their corresponding enzymes proved complex and diverse in different species. Mevalonate pathway genes in pheromone producing male I. pini have much higher basal levels than in females, and feeding induces their expression. In I. duplicatus and I. pini, juvenile hormone III (JH III) induces pheromone production in the absence of feeding, whereas in I. paraconfusus and I. confusus, topically applied JH III does not induce pheromone production. In all four species, feeding induces pheromone production. While many of the details of pheromone production, including the site of synthesis, pathways and knowledge of the enzymes involved are known for Ips, less is known about pheromone production in Dendroctonus. Functional genomics studies are under way in D. ponderosae, which should rapidly increase our understanding of pheromone production in this genus. This chapter presents a historical development of what is known about pheromone production in bark beetles, emphasizes the genomic and post-genomic work in I. pini and points out areas where research is needed to obtain a more complete understanding of pheromone production. "
negative,"Bacillus thuringiensis toxin resistance mechanisms among Lepidoptera: progress on genomic approaches to uncover causal mutations in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. Transgenic plants that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (Cry) protein toxins (Bt crops) effectively control feeding by the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, although documented resistance evolution among a number of species in both the laboratory and field has heightened concerns about the durability of this technology. Research has provided major insights into the mutations that alter Bt toxin binding receptor structure and function within the midgut of Lepidoptera that directly impacts the efficacy of Bt toxins, and potentially leads to the evolution of resistance to Bt crops in the field. In this manuscript we provide an overview of available data on the identification of genes involved in high levels of resistance to Cry toxins, with emphasis on resistance described for O. nubilalis as the main target of Bt corn. "
negative,"Ascovirus P64 Homologs: A Novel Family of Large Cationic Proteins That Condense Viral Genomic DNA for Encapsidation. Eukaryotic dsDNA viruses use small basic protamine-like proteins or histones, typically <15 kDa, to condense and encapsidate their genomic (g)DNAs during virogenesis. Ascoviruses are large dsDNA (~100⁻200 kbp) viruses that are pathogenic to lepidopteran larvae. Little is known about the molecular basis for condensation and encapsidation of their gDNAs. Previous proteomic analysis showed that Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus (SfAV-1a) virions contain a large unique DNA-binding protein (P64; 64 kDa, pI = 12.2) with a novel architecture proposed to condense its gDNA. Here we used physical, biochemical, and transmission electron microscopy techniques to demonstrate that P64's basic C-terminal domain condenses SfAV-1a gDNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that only P64 homologs in other ascovirus virions are unique in stably binding DNA. As similar protein families or subfamilies were not identified in extensive database searches, our collective data suggest that ascovirus P64 homologs comprise a novel family of atypical large viral gDNA condensing proteins.

negative,"Maize plants prime anti-herbivore responses by the memorizing and recalling of airborne information in their genome. Intact maize plants prime for defensive action against herbivory in response to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HI PVs) emitted from caterpillar-infested conspecific plants. The recent research showed that the primed defense in receiver plants that had been exposed to HI PVs was maintained for at least 5 d after exposure. Herbivory triggered the receiver plants to enhance the expression of a defense gene for trypsin inhibitor (TI ). At the upstream sequence of a TI gene, non-methylated cytosine residues were observed in the genome of HI PV-exposed plants more frequently than in that of healthy plant volatile-exposed plants. These findings provide an innovative mechanism for the memory of HI PV-mediated habituation for plant defense. This mechanism and further innovations for priming of defenses via plant communications will contribute to the development of plant volatile-based pest management methods in agriculture and horticulture. "
negative,"Plant-mediated RNAi silences midgut-expressed genes in congeneric lepidopteran insects in nature. BACKGROUND: Plant-mediated RNAi (PMRi) silencing of insect genes has enormous potential for crop protection, but whether it works robustly under field conditions, particularly with lepidopteran pests, remains controversial. Wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and cultivated tobacco (N. tabacum) (Solanaceae) is attacked by two closely related specialist herbivores Manduca sexta and M. quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae). When M. sexta larvae attack transgenic N. attenuata plants expressing double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) targeting M. sexta's midgut-expressed genes, the nicotine-ingestion induced cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (invert repeat (ir)CYP6B46-plants) and the lyciumoside-IV-ingestion induced β-glucosidase1 (irBG1-plants), these larval genes which are important for the larvae's response to ingested host toxins, are strongly silenced. RESULTS: Here we show that the PMRi procedure also silences the homologous genes in native M. quinquemaculata larvae feeding on irCYP6B46 and irBG1-transgenic N. attenuata plants in nature. The PMRi lines shared 98 and 96% sequence similarity with M. quinquemaculata homologous coding sequences, and CYP6B46 and BG1 transcripts were reduced by ca. 90 and 80%, without reducing the transcripts of the larvae's most similar, potential off-target genes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the PMRi procedure can robustly and specifically silence genes in native congeneric insects that share sufficient sequence similarity and with the careful selection of targets, might protect crops from attack by congeneric-groups of insect pests. "
positive,"Two functionally distinct CYP4G genes of Anopheles gambiae contribute to cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) biosynthesis is a major pathway of insect physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster the cytochrome P450 CYP4G1 catalyses the insect-specific oxidative decarbonylation step, while in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, two CYP4G paralogues, CYP4G16 and CYP4G17 are present. Analysis of the subcellular localization of CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 in larval and pupal stages revealed that CYP4G16 preserves its PM localization across developmental stages analyzed; however CYPG17 is differentially localized in two distinct types of pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes of larval and adult developmental specificity. Western blot analysis showed the presence of two CYP4G17 forms, potentially associated with each oenocyte type. Both An. gambiae CYP4Gs were expressed in D. melanogaster flies in a Cyp4g1 silenced background in order to functionally characterize them in vivo. CYP4G16, CYP4G17 or their combination rescued the lethal phenotype of Cyp4g1-knock down flies, demonstrating that CYP4G17 is also a functional decarbonylase, albeit of somewhat lower efficiency than CYP4G16 in Drosophila. Flies expressing mosquito CYP4G16 and / or CYP4G17 produced similar CHC profiles to 'wild-type' flies expressing the endogenous CYP4G1, but they also produce very long-chain dimethyl-branched CHCs not detectable in wild type flies, suggesting that the specificity of the CYP4G enzymes contributes to determine the complexity of the CHC blend. In conclusion, both An. gambiae CYP4G enzymes contribute to the unique Anopheles CHC profile, which has been associated to defense, adult desiccation tolerance, insecticide penetration rate and chemical communication. "
negative,"Evidence of two mechanisms involved in Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis decreased toxicity against mosquito larvae: Genome dynamic and toxins stability. Biopesticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis are the most used and most successful around the world. This bacterium is characterized by a dynamic genome able to win or lose genetic materials which leads to a decrease in its effectiveness. The detection of such phenomena is of great importance to monitor the stability of B. thuringiensis strains in industrial production processes of biopesticides. New local B. thuringiensis israelensis isolates were investigated. They present variable levels of delta-endotoxins production and insecticidal activities against Aedes aegypti larvae. Searching on the origin of this variability, molecular and biochemical analyses were performed. The obtained results describe two main reasons of the decrease of B. thuringiensis israelensis insecticidal activity. The first reason was the deletion of cry4Aa and cry10Aa genes from the 128-kb pBtoxis plasmid as evidenced in three strains (BLB124, BLB199 and BLB506) among five. The second was the early degradation of Cry toxins by proteases in larvae midgut mainly due to some amino acids substitutions evidenced in Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa δ-endotoxins detected in BLB356. Before biological treatment based on B. thuringiensis israelensis, the studies of microflore in each ecosystem have a great importance to succeed pest management programs.  "
negative,"Genome-based identification of spliceosomal proteins in the silk moth Bombyx mori. Pre-messenger RNA splicing is a highly conserved eukaryotic cellular function that takes place by way of a large, RNA-protein assembly known as the spliceosome. In the mammalian system, nearly 300 proteins associate with uridine-rich small nuclear (sn)RNAs to form this complex. Some of these splicing factors are ubiquitously present in the spliceosome, whereas others are involved only in the processing of specific transcripts. Several proteomics analyses have delineated the proteins of the spliceosome in several species. In this study, we mine multiple sequence data sets of the silk moth Bombyx mori in an attempt to identify the entire set of known spliceosomal proteins. Five data sets were utilized, including the 3X, 6X, and Build 2.0 genomic contigs as well as the expressed sequence tag and protein libraries. While homologs for 88% of vertebrate splicing factors were delineated in the Bombyx mori genome, there appear to be several spliceosomal polypeptides absent in Bombyx mori and seven additional insect species. This apparent increase in spliceosomal complexity in vertebrates may reflect the tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing requirements in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 eukaryotic taxa using the core splicing factors suggest that the essential functional units of the pre-mRNA processing machinery have remained highly conserved from yeast to humans. The Sm and LSm proteins are the most conserved, whereas proteins of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle are the most divergent. These data highlight both the differential conservation and relative phylogenetic signals of the essential spliceosomal components throughout evolution. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Sasakia funebris (Leech) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and comparison with other Apaturinae insects. Sasakia funebris, a member of the lepidopteran family, Nymphalidae (superfamily Papilionoidea) is a rare species and is found only in some areas of South China. In this study, the 15,233 bp long complete mitochondrial genome of S. funebris was determined, and harbors the gene arrangement identical to all other sequenced lepidopteran insects. The nucleotide composition of the genome is highly A+T biased, accounting for 81.2%. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) start with typical ATN codons, except for COI which begins with the CGA codon. All tRNAs have a typical clover-leaf secondary structure, except for tRNASer(AGN), the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of which forms a simple loop. The S. funebris A+T-rich region of 370 bp contains several features common to the Lepidoptera insects, including the motif ATAGA followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch, and two tandem repeats consisting of 18 bp repeat units and 14 bp repeat units. The phylogenetic analyses of Apaturinae based on mitogenome sequences showed: (S. funebris+Sasakia charonda)+(Apatura metis+Apatura ilia). This result is consistent with the morphological classification. "
negative,"Genome interdependence in insect-bacterium symbioses. Symbioses between unicellular and multicellular organisms have contributed significantly to the evolution of life on Earth. As exemplified by several studies of bacterium-insect symbioses, modern genomic techniques are providing exciting new information about the molecular basis and the biological roles of these complex relationships, revealing for instance that symbionts have lost many genes for functions that are provided by the host, but that they can provide amino acids that the host cannot synthesize. "
positive,"Characterization of a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene from Spodoptera exigua and its function identification through RNA interference. Trehalose is an important disaccharide and a key regulation factor for the development of many organisms, including plants, bacteria, fungi and insects. In order to study the trehalose synthesis pathway, a cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Spodoptera exigua (SeTPS) was cloned which contained an open reading frame of 2481 nucleotides encoding a protein of 826 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 92.65kDa. The SeTPS genome has 12 exons and 11 introns. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body and in the ovary. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in day 1 S. exigua pupae. The concentrations of trehalose and glucose in the hemolymph were determined by HPLC and showed that they varied at different developmental stages and were negatively correlated to each other. The survival rates of the insects injected with dsRNA corresponding to SeTPS gene reached 53.95%, 49.06%, 34.86% and 33.24% for 36, 48, 60 and 204h post-injection respectively which were significantly lower than those of the insects in three control groups. These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and potential function of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene. "
negative,"Post-integration behavior of a Minos transposon in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Transposable elements represent important tools to perform functional studies in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, the remobilization properties of transposable elements have been utilized for enhancer-trapping and insertional mutagenesis experiments, which have considerably helped in the functional characterization of the fruitfly genome. In Anopheles mosquitoes, the sole vectors of human malaria, as well as in other mosquito vectors of disease, the use of transposons has also been advocated to achieve the spread of anti-parasitic genes throughout field populations. Here we report on the post-integration behavior of the Minos transposon in both the germ-line and somatic tissues of Anopheles mosquitoes. Transgenic An. stephensi lines developed using the piggyBac transposon and expressing the Minos transposase were tested for their ability to remobilize an X-linked Minos element. Germ-line remobilization events were not detected, while somatic excisions and transpositions were consistently recovered. The analysis of these events showed that Minos activity in Anopheles cells is characterized by unconventional functionality of the transposon. In the two cases analyzed, re-integration of the transposon occurred onto the same X chromosome, suggesting a tendency for local hopping of Minos in the mosquito genome. This is the first report of the post-integration behavior of a transposable element in a human malaria vector. "
negative,"Enhanced whitefly resistance in transgenic tobacco plants expressing double stranded RNA of v-ATPase A gene. BACKGROUND: Expression of double strand RNA (dsRNA) designed against important insect genes in transgenic plants have been shown to give protection against pests through RNA interference (RNAi), thus opening the way for a new generation of insect-resistant crops. We have earlier compared the efficacy of dsRNAs / siRNAs, against a number of target genes, for interference in growth of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) upon oral feeding. The v-ATPase subunit A (v-ATPaseA) coding gene was identified as a crucial target. We now report the effectiveness of transgenic tobacco plants expressing siRNA to silence v-ATPaseA gene expression for the control of whitefly infestation. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Transgenic tobacco lines were developed for the expression of long dsRNA precursor to make siRNA and knock down the v-ATPaseA mRNA in whitefly. Molecular analysis and insecticidal properties of the transgenic plants established the formation of siRNA targeting the whitefly v-ATPaseA, in the leaves. The transcript level of v-ATPaseA in whiteflies was reduced up to 62% after feeding on the transgenic plants. Heavy infestation of whiteflies on the control plants caused significant loss of sugar content which led to the drooping of leaves. The transgenic plants did not show drooping effect. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Host plant derived pest resistance was achieved against whiteflies by genetic transformation of tobacco which generated siRNA against the whitefly v-ATPaseA gene. Transgenic tobacco lines expressing dsRNA of v-ATPaseA, delivered sufficient siRNA to whiteflies feeding on them, mounting a significant silencing response, leading to their mortality. The transcript level of the target gene was reduced in whiteflies feeding on transgenic plants. The strategy can be taken up for genetic engineering of plants to control whiteflies in field crops. "
negative,"Experimental RNomics and genomic comparative analysis reveal a large group of species-specific small non-message RNAs in the silkworm Bombyx mori. Accumulating evidences show that small non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in development, stress response and other cellular processes. The silkworm is an important model for studies on insect genetics and control of lepidopterous pests. Here, we have performed the first systematic identification and analysis of intermediate size ncRNAs (50-500 nt) in the silkworm. We identified 189 novel ncRNAs, including 141 snoRNAs, six snRNAs, three tRNAs, one SRP and 38 unclassified ncRNAs. Forty ncRNAs showed significantly altered expression during silkworm development or across specific stage transitions. Genomic comparisons revealed that 123 of these ncRNAs are potentially silkworm-specific. Analysis of the genomic organization of the ncRNA loci showed that 32.62% of the novel snoRNA loci are intergenic, and that all the intronic snoRNAs follow the pattern of one-snoRNA-per-intron. Target site analysis predicted a total of 95 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modification sites of rRNAs, snRNAs and tRNAs. Together, these findings provide new clues for future functional study of ncRNA during insect development and evolution. "
negative,"Host-mediated RNA interference targeting a cuticular protein gene impaired fecundity in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae. BACKGROUND: The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a devastating sap-sucking insect pest that damages many host plants worldwide and causes billions of dollars of crop losses. Induction of RNA interference (RNAi) through oral feeding of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been demonstrated in aphids. Therefore, host-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to vital structural genes of aphids has been envisaged as a tool for the development of resistance against this aphid species. RESULTS: Cuticular protein (CP) senses seasonal photoperiodism and drives a shift from clonal to sexual generation in aphids. Thus, attenuation of CP gene expression is likely to result in a different reproductive orientation in aphids and thereby affect their fecundity. A gene encoding CP in M. persicae has been targeted for RNAi-mediated knockdown. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing dsRNA homologous to the MyCP gene was developed. The dsRNA-transgenics produced gene-specific siRNAs fed by aphids infesting the transgenics. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) study revealed an attenuated level of transcripts of the CP gene in aphid nymphs reared on the transgenic plants. Decreased expression of the CP gene resulted in a noticeable decline in aphid fecundity on the transgenic Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSION: Increasing genetic resistance is the only sustainable way of minimizing the use of toxic agrochemicals to protect plants. Host-mediated RNAi of important insect genes has been proposed as a potential avenue for developing crop resistance against insect pests. This study demonstrated the potential of MyCP dsRNA in developing RNAi-based resistance to M. persicae. RNAi-mediated resistance is expected to be more durable compared with other transgenic strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. "
negative,"Evolution in the fast lane: rapidly evolving sex-related genes in Drosophila. A large portion of the annotated genes in Drosophila melanogaster show sex-biased expression, indicating that sex and reproduction-related genes (SRR genes) represent an appreciable component of the genome. Previous studies, in which subsets of genes were compared among few Drosophila species, have found that SRR genes exhibit unusual evolutionary patterns. Here, we have used the newly released genome sequences from 12 Drosophila species, coupled to a larger set of SRR genes, to comprehensively test the generality of these patterns. Among 2505 SRR genes examined, including ESTs with biased expression in reproductive tissues and genes characterized as involved in gametogenesis, we find that a relatively high proportion of SRR genes have experienced accelerated divergence throughout the genus Drosophila. Several testis-specific genes, male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs), and spermatogenesis genes show lineage-specific bursts of accelerated evolution and positive selection. SFP genes also show evidence of lineage-specific gene loss and / or gain. These results bring us closer to understanding the details of the evolutionary dynamics of SRR genes with respect to species divergence. "
negative,"A whole genome screening and RNA interference identify a juvenile hormone esterase-like gene of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in preventing precocious metamorphosis and stimulating reproduction. Thus, its hemolymph titer should be under a tight control. As a negative controller, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) performs a rapid breakdown of residual JH in the hemolymph during last instar to induce a larval-to-pupal metamorphosis. A whole genome of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, has been annotated and proposed 11 JHE candidates. Sequence analysis using conserved motifs commonly found in other JHEs proposed a putative JHE (Px004817). Px004817 (64.61 kDa, pI=5.28) exhibited a characteristic JHE expression pattern by showing high peak at the early last instar, at which JHE enzyme activity was also at a maximal level. RNA interference of Px004817 reduced JHE activity and interrupted pupal development with a significant increase of larval period. This study identifies Px004817 as a JHE-like gene of P. xylostella. "
negative,"The genome biology of phytoplasma: modulators of plants and insects. Phytoplasmas are bacterial pathogens of plants that are transmitted by insects. These bacteria uniquely multiply intracellularly in both plants (Plantae) and insects (Animalia). Similarly to bacterial endosymbionts, phytoplasmas have reduced genomes with limited metabolic capabilities. Nonetheless, the chromosomes of many phytoplasmas are rich in repeated DNA consisting of mobile elements. Phytoplasmas produce an arsenal of effectors most of which are encoded on these mobile elements and on plasmids. These effectors target conserved plant transcription factors resulting in witches' broom and leafy flower symptoms and suppression of plant defense to insect vectors that transmit the phytoplasmas. Future studies of these fascinating microbes will generate a wealth of new knowledge about forces that shape genomes and microbial interactions with multicellular hosts. "
negative,"The distribution of microsatellites in the Nasonia parasitoid wasp genome. Microsatellites are important molecular markers used in numerous genetic contexts. Despite this widespread use, the evolutionary processes governing microsatellite distribution and diversity remain controversial. Here, we present results on the distribution of microsatellites of three species in the parasitic wasp genus Nasonia generated by an in silico data-mining approach. Our results show that the overall microsatellite density in Nasonia is comparable to that of the honey bee, but much higher than in eight non-Hymenopteran arthropods. Across the Nasonia vitripennis genome, microsatellite density varied both within and amongst chromosomes. In contrast to other taxa, dinucleotides are the most abundant repeat type in all four species of Hymenoptera studied. Whether the differences between the Hymenoptera and other taxa are of functional significance remains to be determined. "
negative,"Transcriptome analysis in the beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). The beet webworm, Spoladea recurvalis Fabricius, is a destructive pest on vegetable crops in tropics and subtropics; its main host plant is amaranth. It has become imperative to develop non-chemical methods to control S. recurvalis on amaranth. However, the lack of molecular information about this species has hindered the development of novel pest management strategies. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing covering de novo sequence assemblies, functional annotation of transcripts, gene function classification and enrichment was performed on S. recurvalis. Illumina sequencing generated a total of 120 435 transcript contigs ranging from 201 to 22 729 bases with a mean length of 688 bases. The assembled transcripts were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool-X (BLASTX) to obtain the annotations against non-redundant, Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) protein databases. A subset of 58 225 transcript sequences returned hits from known proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and the majority of the transcript sequences had the highest number of hits for Danaus plexippus (50.43%). A total of 1217 Gene Ontology-level 3 annotations were assigned to 51 805 transcripts, while 39 650 transcripts were predicted as functional protein-coding genes in the COG database and 20 037 transcripts were enriched to KEGG pathways. We identified 40 putative genes related to pheromone production and reception in S. recurvalis, with the expression of one gene between 0.29 and 1141.79 fragments per kilo base per million (FPKM) reads. The transcriptome sequence of S. recurvalis is a first step toward offering a comprehensive genomic resource which would enable better understanding of molecular mechanisms to enable development of effective pest management practices for this species.

negative,"Superinfection of five Wolbachia in the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) (Coleoptera: Curuculionidae). Wolbachia bacteria are among the most common endosymbionts in insects. In Wolbachia research, the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene has been used as a phylogenetic tool, but relationships inferred by single-locus analysis can be unreliable because of the extensive genome recombination among Wolbachia strains. Therefore, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method for Wolbachia, which relies upon a set of five conserved genes, is recommended. In this study, we examined whether the alnus ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford), is infected with Wolbachia using wsp and MLST genes. Wolbachia was detected from all tested specimens of X. germanus (n=120) by wsp amplification. Five distinct sequences (i.e. five alleles) for wsp were found, and labeled as wXge1-5. MLST analysis and molecular phylogeny of concatenated sequences of MLST genes identified wXge3 and wXge5 as closely-related strains. The detection rate of wXge4 and wXge1 was 100% and 63.3%, respectively; wXge2, wXge3 and wXge5 were detected from less than 15% of specimens. We performed mitochondrial haplotype analyses that identified three genetic types of X. germanus, i.e. Clades A, B and C. Wsp alleles wXge1, wXge2 and wXge4 were detected in all clade A beetles; wXge2 allele was absent from Clades B and C. We concluded that (i) five wsp alleles were found from X. germanus, (ii) use of MLST genes, rather than the wsp gene, are more suited to construct Wolbachia phylogenies and (iii) wsp alleles wXge2 and wXge3 / wXge5 would infect clade A and clade B / C of X. germanus, respectively.

negative,"Complete Genome Sequence of Bacillus bombysepticus, a Pathogen Leading to Bombyx mori Black Chest Septicemia. Bacillus bombysepticus is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium. Here, we announce the first complete genome sequence of this organism isolated from the cadavers of silkworm larvae that had been sick. The genome contains a single circular chromosome and a circular plasmid. Analyses of the B. bombysepticus genome will provide insights into its pathomechanisms and biology.  "
negative,"The complete mitogenome of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) and comparison with other lepidopteran insects. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Bombyx mori strain Dazao (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) was determined to be 15,653bp, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a A+T-rich region. It has the typical gene organization and order of mitogenomes from lepidopteran insects. The AT skew of this mitogenome was slightly positive and the nucleotide composition was also biased toward A+T nucleotides (81.31%). All PCGs were initiated by ATN codons, except for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene which was initiated by CGA. The cox1 and cox2 genes had incomplete stop codons consisting of just a T. All the tRNA genes displayed a typical clover-leaf structure of mitochondrial tRNA. The A+T-rich region of the mitogenome was 495bp in length and consisted of several features common to the lepidopteras. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the B. mori Dazao was close to Bombycidae. "
positive,"Downregulation of dystrophin expression in pupae of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci inhibits the emergence of adults. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a major pest to agriculture. Adults are able to fly for long distances and to colonize staple crops, herbs and ornamentals, and to vector viruses belonging to several important taxonomic groups. During their early development, whiteflies mature from eggs through several nymphal stages (instars I to IV) until adults emerge from pupae. We aim at reducing whitefly populations by inhibiting the emergence of adults from nymphs. Here we targeted dystrophin, a conserved protein essential for the development of the muscle system in humans, other animals and insects. We have exploited the fact that whitefly nymphs developing on tomato leaves feed from the plant phloem via their stylets. Thus, we delivered dystrophin-silencing double-stranded RNA to nymphs developing on leaves of tomato plantlets with their roots bathing in the silencing solution. Downregulation of dystrophin expression occurred mainly in pupae. Dystrophin silencing induced also the downregulation of the dystrophin-associated protein genes actin and tropomyosin, and disrupted F-actin. Most significantly, the treatment inhibited the emergence of adults from pupae, suggesting that targeting dystrophin may help to restrain whitefly populations. This study demonstrates for the first time the important role of dystrophin in the development of a major insect pest to agriculture. "
negative,"Ecdysteroid-mediated expression of hexamerin (arylphorin) in the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The insect development is intricately controlled by morphogenetic hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) through the regulation of gene / protein expression. The role of hexamerins in the metamorphosis of insects and reproduction and their control by 20E at the gene level has been widely reported in insects. In the present study we for the first time report the role of ecdysteroids in the regulation of hexamerin synthesis in a lepidopteran insect Corcyra cephalonica. The hormonal studies were carried out using the normal and the thorax-ligated insects with both 20E and its non-steroidal agonist RH-5992. The in vitro as well as in vivo studies showed a stimulatory effect of 20E and its agonist on the hexamerin synthesis including arylphorin (Hex 2), whereas hormone blockade with azadirachtin caused a time dependent reduction in synthesis. The northern analysis using Hex 2b cDNA as probe too confirmed the above result. This was followed by the cloning of the Hex 2b gene. The full length of the genomic clone was found to be 3.5kb long and has four exons interspersed by three introns. The genome walking analysis revealed the presence of a steroid hormone binding sequence ""Ecdysone response element"" (EcRE) in the 5' untranscribed region (UTR) of the gene. The data presented in this paper clearly suggest that hexamerin synthesis in C. cephalonica is transcriptionally regulated by 20E. "
negative,"Morphological and genomic characterization of the polydnavirus associated with the parasitoid wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Glyptapanteles indiensis polydnavirus (GiPDV) is essential for successful parasitization of the larval stage of the lepidopteran Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) by the endoparasitic wasp Glyptapanteles indiensis. This virus has not been characterized previously. Ultrastructural studies of GiPDV showed that virions had a rod-like or rectangular form and each contained as many as ten nucleocapsids enclosed by a single unit membrane envelope. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) analysis of the virus genomic DNA revealed that GiPDV had a segmented genome composed of 13 dsDNA segments, ranging in size from approximately 11 kb to more than 30 kb. Four genomic segments were present in higher molar concentration than the others. Further characterization of the GiPDV genome yielded several cDNA clones which derived from GiPDV-specific mRNAs, and Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of isolated cDNA clones in the parasitized host. Each was present on more than one GiPDV genomic DNA segment, suggesting the existence of related sequences among DNA segments. It has been proposed previously that in polydnavirus systems, genome segmentation, hypermolar ratio segments and segment nesting may function to increase the copy number of essential genes and to increase the levels of gene expression in the absence of virus replication. The present data support this notion and suggest that GiPDV morphology and genomic organization may be intrinsically linked to the function and evolutionary strategies of the virus. "
negative,"Insect symbionts as valuable grist for the biotechnological mill: an alkaliphilic silkworm gut bacterium for efficient lactic acid production. Insects constitute the most abundant and diverse animal class and act as hosts to an extraordinary variety of symbiotic microorganisms. These microbes living inside the insects play critical roles in host biology and are also valuable bioresources. Enterococcus mundtii EMB156, isolated from the larval gut (gut pH >10) of the model organism Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), efficiently produces lactic acid, an important metabolite for industrial production of bioplastic materials. E. mundtii EMB156 grows well under alkaline conditions and stably converts various carbon sources into lactic acid, offering advantages in downstream fermentative processes. High-yield lactic acid production can be achieved by the strain EMB156 from renewable biomass substrates under alkaline pretreatments. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology revealed its 3.01 Mbp whole genome sequence. A total of 2956 protein-coding sequences, 65 tRNA genes, and 6 rRNA operons were predicted in the EMB156 chromosome. Remarkable genomic features responsible for lactic acid fermentation included key enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate (PP) / glycolytic pathway, and an alpha amylase and xylose isomerase were characterized in EMB156. This genomic information coincides with the phenotype of E. mundtii EMB156, reflecting its metabolic flexibility in efficient lactate fermentation, and established a foundation for future biotechnological application. Interestingly, enzyme activities of amylase were quite stable in high-pH broths, indicating a possible mechanism for strong EMB156 growth in an alkaline environment, thereby facilitating lactic acid production. Together, these findings implied that valuable lactic acid-producing bacteria can be discovered efficiently by screening under the extremely alkaline conditions, as exemplified by gut microbial symbionts of Lepidoptera insects. "
negative,"Midgut and salivary gland transcriptomes of the arbovirus vector Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Numerous Culicoides spp. are important vectors of livestock or human disease pathogens. Transcriptome information from midguts and salivary glands of adult female Culicoides sonorensis provides new insight into vector biology. Of 1719 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from adult serum-fed female midguts harvested within 5 h of feeding, twenty-eight clusters of serine proteases were derived. Four clusters encode putative iron binding proteins (FER1, FERL, PXDL1, PXDL2), and two clusters encode metalloendopeptidases (MDP6C, MDP6D) that probably function in bloodmeal catabolism. In addition, a diverse variety of housekeeping cDNAs were identified. Selected midgut protease transcripts were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR): TRY1_115 and MDP6C mRNAs were induced in adult female midguts upon feeding, whereas TRY1_156 and CHYM1 were abundant in midguts both before and immediately after feeding. Of 708 salivary gland ESTs analysed, clusters representing two new classes of protein families were identified: a new class of D7 proteins and a new class of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. Additional cDNAs representing putative immunomodulatory proteins were also identified: 5' nucleotidases, antigen 5-related proteins, a hyaluronidase, a platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, mucins and several immune response cDNAs. Analysis by q-PCR showed that all D7 and Kunitz domain transcripts tested were highly enriched in female heads compared with other tissues and were generally absent from males. The mRNAs of two additional protease inhibitors, TFPI1 and TFPI2, were detected in salivary glands of paraffin-embedded females by in situ hybridization. "
negative,"Behavioral and genomic characterization of molt-sleep in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. During the transition from feeding to molting, larval insects undergo profound changes in behavior and patterns of gene expression regulated by the neuroendocrine system. For some species, a distinctive characteristic of molting larvae is presence of a quiescent state sometimes referred to as ""molt-sleep"". Here, observations of 4th instar Manduca sexta larvae indicate the molting period involves a predominantly quiescent state that shares behavioral properties of adult insect sleep in that it is rapidly reversible and accompanied by a reduced responsiveness to both mildly arousing and noxious stimuli. When subjected to noxious stimuli, molting larvae exhibit locomotory and avoidance behaviors similar to those of inter-molt larvae. Although less consolidated, inter-molt quiescence shares many of the same behavioral traits with molting quiescence. However, when subjected to deprivation of quiescence, inter-molt larvae display a compensatory rebound behavior that is not detected in molting larvae. This suggests that molting quiescence is a specialized form of inactivity that affords survival advantages to molting larvae. RNA-seq analysis of molting larvae shows general reduction in expression of genes encoding GPCRs and down regulation of genes connected with cyclic nucleotide signaling. On the other hand, certain ion channel genes are up-regulated, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, chloride channels and a voltage-dependent calcium channel. These findings suggest patterns of gene expression consistent with elevation of quiescent state characteristic of the molt in a model holometabolous insect.  "
negative,"An expansion of the dual clip-domain serine proteinase family in Manduca sexta: gene organization, expression, and evolution of prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase-2, hemolymph proteinase 12, and other related proteinases. Prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases (PAPs) take part in insect defense responses including melanotic encapsulation and wound healing. To understand their gene structure and regulation, we screened a genomic library and isolated overlapping lambda clones for Manduca sexta PAP-2, hemolymph proteinase 12 (HP12), and HP24. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that all three genes encode polypeptides with two regulatory clip domains at the amino terminus, a linker region, and a catalytic serine proteinase domain at the carboxyl terminus. Each gene contains eight exons, with introns located at equivalent positions. Similar sequences are present in introns as well as exons, indicating that these genes arose from recent gene duplication and sequence divergence. We analyzed their 5' flanking sequences and identified putative immune and hormone responsive elements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions confirmed that PAP-2 and HP12 mRNA levels in the larval fat body and hemocytes increased after a bacterial challenge. However, HP24 expression was barely detected. PAP-2 transcripts in cultured fat body became less abundant after 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. Thus, PAP-2, HP12, and HP24 mRNA levels are differentially regulated by immune and developmental signals. Comparison with HP15, HP23, and PAP-3 sequences suggested an evolutionary pathway of the dual clip-domain serine proteinases in M. sexta. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Ceratitis capitata has been determined. The circular genome is 15 980 bp long and contains a standard gene complement, i.e. the large and small ribosomal RNA subunits, twenty-two transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and thirteen genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. When comparing the sequence to fragments previously sequenced from other isolates it becomes apparent that interstrain polymorphisms are not rare. These differences are potentially useful for the development of diagnostic tools for population analysis applications, such as determining the source of recent introductions. Moreover, they could help obtain a solution to the long-lasting controversy on the possible eradication of the Medfly from certain locations. "
negative,"Stimulation of polydnavirus replication by 20-hydroxyecdysone. During oviposition the endoparasitic wasp Campoletis sonorensis, introduces a polydnavirus into parasitized insects where viral gene expression is required for endoparasite survival. The polydnavirus is integrated into wasp chromosomal DNA and replicates only in the ovary. Ecdysteroids regulate the developmental expression of many insect genes and may regulate polydnavirus replication. Direct verification of viral replication was performed by dot blot hybridization and by amplifying DNA sequences containing the viral integration site; this 'junction' fragment cannot be amplified from integrated virus. Thoracic ligations and in vitro ecdysteroid treatments of wasp ovaries support the hypothesis that polydnavirus DNA replication is regulated by ecdysteroid during parasite development. "
negative,"Insect herbivory elicits genome-wide alternative splicing responses in Nicotiana attenuata. Changes in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) are involved in many responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in eukaryotic organisms. In response to attack and oviposition by insect herbivores, plants elicit rapid changes in gene expression which are essential for the activation of plant defenses; however, the herbivory-induced changes in AS remain unstudied. Using mRNA sequencing, we performed a genome-wide analysis on tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) feeding-induced AS in both leaves and roots of Nicotiana attenuata. Feeding by M. sexta for 5 h reduced total AS events by 7.3% in leaves but increased them in roots by 8.0% and significantly changed AS patterns in leaves and roots of existing AS genes. Feeding by M. sexta also resulted in increased (in roots) and decreased (in leaves) transcript levels of the serine / arginine-rich (SR) proteins that are involved in the AS machinery of plants and induced changes in SR gene expression that were jasmonic acid (JA)-independent in leaves but JA-dependent in roots. Changes in AS and gene expression elicited by M. sexta feeding were regulated independently in both tissues. This study provides genome-wide evidence that insect herbivory induces changes not only in the levels of gene expression but also in their splicing, which might contribute to defense against and / or tolerance of herbivory.  "
negative,"Reliable protocols for whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum: a comprehensive survey and analysis. RNA in situ hybridization (ISH), including chromogenic ISH (CISH) and fluorescent ISH (FISH), has become a powerful tool for revealing the spatial distribution of gene transcripts in model organisms. Previously, we developed a robust protocol for whole-mount RNA CISH in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, an emerging insect genomic model. In order to improve the resolving capacity of gene detection, we comprehensively surveyed current protocols of whole-mount RNA-FISH and developed protocols that allow, using confocal microscopy, clearer visualization of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) - including those subcellularly localized and those with spatially overlapping expression. We find that Fast dye-based substrate fluorescence (SF), tyramide signal amplification (TSA), and TSA Plus all enable identifying gene expression thanks to multiplex amplification of fluorescent signals. By contrast, methods of direct fluorescence (DF) do not allow visualizing signals. Detection of a single gene target was achieved with SF and TSA Plus for most mRNAs, whereas TSA only allowed visualization of abundant transcripts such as Apvas1 and Appiwi2 in the germ cells. For detection of multiple gene targets using double FISH, we recommend: (i) TSA / TSA, rather than TSA Plus / TSA Plus for colocalized mRNAs abundantly expressed in germ cells, as proteinase K treatment can be omitted; and (ii) SF / TSA Plus for other gene targets such as Apen1 and Apen2 as inactivation of enzyme conjugates is not required. SF / SF is not ideal for double FISH experiments due to signal blurring. Based on these new conditions for RNA-FISH, we have obtained a better understanding of germline specification and embryonic segmentation in the pea aphid. We anticipate that the RNA-FISH protocols for the pea aphid may also be used for other aphids and possibly other insect species, thus expanding the range of species from which useful insights into development and evolution may be obtained.  "
negative,"The Bear Giant-Skipper genome suggests genetic adaptations to living inside yucca roots. Giant-Skippers (Megathymini) are unusual thick-bodied, moth-like butterflies whose caterpillars feed inside Yucca roots and Agave leaves. Giant-Skippers are attributed to the subfamily Hesperiinae and they are endemic to southern and mostly desert regions of the North American continent. To shed light on the genotypic determinants of their unusual phenotypic traits, we sequenced and annotated a draft genome of the largest Giant-Skipper species, the Bear (Megathymus ursus violae). The Bear skipper genome is the least heterozygous among sequenced Lepidoptera genomes, possibly due to much smaller population size and extensive inbreeding. Their lower heterozygosity helped us to obtain a high-quality genome with an N50 of 4.2 Mbp. The ~ 430 Mb genome encodes about 14000 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis supports placement of Giant-Skippers with Grass-Skippers (Hesperiinae). We find that proteins involved in odorant and taste sensing as well as in oxidative reactions have diverged significantly in Megathymus as compared to Lerema, another Grass-Skipper. In addition, the Giant-Skipper has lost several odorant and gustatory receptors and possesses many fewer (1 / 3-1 / 2 of other skippers) anti-oxidative enzymes. Such differences may be related to the unusual life style of Giant-Skippers: they do not feed as adults, and their caterpillars feed inside Yuccas and Agaves, which provide a source of antioxidants such as polyphenols. "
positive,"Isolation and expression analysis of a homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon gene in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. A full-length 14-3-3 gene homolog (also referred to as the Px14-3-3 epsilon ""ε"" or Px14-3-3ε gene) was cloned from cDNA of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. The Px14-3-3 transcript is 789 nucleotides in length, and the predicted polypeptide is 263 amino acids in length, with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The Px14-3-3 gene contains the typical and predicted 14-3-3 domains and motifs. The amino acid sequence of the diamondback moth 14-3-3 gene is very similar to that of other insect epsilons (ε) but not to other insect zetas (ζ). In particular, the protein sequence of the Px14-3-3 gene shows high identity to the Bombyx mori epsilon (96.2%). Western blot analysis using an antibody against Px14-3-3ε verified the expression of 14-3-3ε in the larval, pupal, and adult stages. The Px14-3-3ε expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth instar larvae. Px14-3-3ε was detected in every tissue examined, including the body fat, hemocytes, brain, gut, and cuticle. "
negative,"A new mapping method for quantitative trait loci of silkworm. BACKGROUND: Silkworm is the basis of sericultural industry and the model organism in insect genetics study. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying economically important traits of silkworm is of high significance for promoting the silkworm molecular breeding and advancing our knowledge on genetic architecture of the Lepidoptera. Yet, the currently used mapping methods are not well suitable for silkworm, because of ignoring the recombination difference in meiosis between two sexes. RESULTS: A mixed linear model including QTL main effects, epistatic effects, and QTL × sex interaction effects was proposed for mapping QTLs in an F2 population of silkworm. The number and positions of QTLs were determined by F-test and model selection. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to estimate and test genetic effects of QTLs and QTL × sex interaction effects. The effectiveness of the model and statistical method was validated by a series of simulations. The results indicate that when markers are distributed sparsely on chromosomes, our method will substantially improve estimation accuracy as compared to the normal chiasmate F2 model. We also found that a sample size of hundreds was sufficiently large to unbiasedly estimate all the four types of epistases (i.e., additive-additive, additive-dominance, dominance-additive, and dominance-dominance) when the paired QTLs reside on different chromosomes in silkworm. CONCLUSION: The proposed method could accurately estimate not only the additive, dominance and digenic epistatic effects but also their interaction effects with sex, correcting the potential bias and precision loss in the current QTL mapping practice of silkworm and thus representing an important addition to the arsenal of QTL mapping tools. "
negative,"Mitochondrial genome characteristics of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) and comparation with other Noctuoidea insects. In this study, mitogenome of Somena scintillans (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) were sequenced and compared with other Noctuoidea species. The mitogenome is 15,410 base pairs in length. All 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) are initiated by ATN codons except cox1 with CGA and all of PCGs terminate with TAA except nad4 with TAG. The codons ACG and CGC are absent. All the tRNA genes could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure except the trnS1 which not only loses dihydrouridine (DHU) arm but also mutates its anticodon into TCT. In the AT-rich region of the mitogenome the motif 'ATAGA' mutates to 'ATATA' and two copies of 161 bp-tandem repeats and two 'TA' short tandem repeats are founded. Phylogenetic analyses showed that S. scintillans is clustered into subfamily Lymatriinae. The phylogenetic relationships within Noctuoidea is (((Nolidae + (Euteliidae + Noctuidae)) + Erebidae) + Notodontidae). "
positive,"Isolation and molecular characterization of Musca domestica delta-9 desaturase sequences. We have isolated fatty acyl-CoA desaturase cDNA (Mdomd9) and genomic sequences from the housefly, Musca domestica. Two approximately 1.66 kb cDNAs were recovered. They had identical coding regions and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but differed in their 5' UTRs. The open reading frame encodes a 380 amino acid (aa) protein with 82% identity to Drosophila melanogaster desat1, and significant (> 50%) identity with other insect delta-9 desaturases. Functional analyses in a yeast expression system confirmed the cDNA encodes a delta9 desaturase. Northern analysis indicated two transcripts of 1.7 and 2.9 kb that hybridized specifically to the open reading frame. PCR amplification of genomic templates revealed three intron sites that are conserved among other insect species. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicated at least two desaturase gene copies per haploid genome. There is a high degree of polymorphism, most of which appears to be due to variable intron sequences; curiously, individual flies had varying morphs of intron II and intron III. Together, the data suggest that there are more delta9 desaturase alleles within the population studied than there are loci within the genome, and support other studies suggesting that insect fatty acyl-CoA desaturases are a dynamically evolving gene family. "
negative,"A molecular and genomic reference system for conifer defence against insects. Insect pests are part of natural forest ecosystems contributing to forest rejuvenation but can also cause ecological disturbance and economic losses that are expected to increase with climate change. The white pine or spruce weevil (Pissodes strobi) is a pest of conifer forests in North America. Weevil-host interactions with various spruce (Picea) species have been explored as a genomic and molecular reference system for conifer defence against insects. Interactions occur in two major phases of the insect life cycle. In the exophase, adult weevils are free-moving and display behaviour of host selection for oviposition that is affected by host traits. In the endophase, insects live within the host where mobility and development from eggs to young adults are affected by a complex system of host defences. Genetic resistance exists in several spruce species and involves synergism of constitutive and induced chemical and physical defences that comprise the conifer defence syndrome. Here, we review conifer defences that disrupt the weevil life cycle and mechanisms by which trees resist weevil attack. We highlight molecular and genomic aspects and a possible role for the weevil microbiome. Knowledge of this conifer defence system is supporting forest health strategies and tree breeding for insect resistance. "
negative,"Characterization of Adult Transcriptomes from the Omnivorous Lady Beetle Coleomegilla maculata Fed Pollen or Insect Egg Diet. Diet, nutrition, and obesity are important topics of current research. While many insect genome and / or transcriptome models are based on dietary specialists, the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata, a common New World species, is highly omnivorous. C. maculata feeds on plants, fungi, insects and other arthropods; its diet frequently includes conspecific cannibalism. This study reports and discusses the first nutritionally based C. maculata transcriptomes. These transcriptomes were prepared from highly inbred specimens provided limited diets, after adult eclosion, of either pollen only or eggs of a soft bodied hemipteran insect only. Selected sequences from the transcriptomes were compared to verify basic genetic similarity of the sampled individuals. Differentially expressed genes associated with these diets were identified to aid with studies of omnivore diet and nutrition. Selected transcriptome sequences described herein are filed with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), GenBank Bioproject PRJNA236444.  "
negative,"Power, resolution and bias: recent advances in insect phylogeny driven by the genomic revolution. Our understanding on the phylogenetic relationships of insects has been revolutionised in the last decade by the proliferation of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS). NGS has allowed insect systematists to assemble very large molecular datasets that include both model and non-model organisms. Such datasets often include a large proportion of the total number of protein coding sequences available for phylogenetic comparison. We review some early entomological phylogenomic studies that employ a range of different data sampling protocols and analyses strategies, illustrating a fundamental renaissance in our understanding of insect evolution all driven by the genomic revolution. The analysis of phylogenomic datasets is challenging because of their size and complexity, and it is obvious that the increasing size alone does not ensure that phylogenetic signal overcomes systematic biases in the data. Biases can be due to various factors such as the method of data generation and assembly, or intrinsic biological feature of the data per se, such as similarities due to saturation or compositional heterogeneity. Such biases often cause violations in the underlying assumptions of phylogenetic models. We review some of the bioinformatics tools available and being developed to detect and minimise systematic biases in phylogenomic datasets. Phylogenomic-scale data coupled with sophisticated analyses will revolutionise our understanding of insect functional genomics. This will illuminate the relationship between the vast range of insect phenotypic diversity and underlying genetic diversity. In combination with rapidly developing methods to estimate divergence times, these analyses will also provide a compelling view of the rates and patterns of lineagenesis (birth of lineages) over the half billion years of insect evolution. "
positive,"Environmental dissemination of mcr-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae by Chrysomya spp. (common blowfly): An increasing public health risk. Until recently, the role of insects, and particularly flies, in disseminating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been poorly studied. In this study, we screened blowflies (Chrysomya spp.) from different areas near the city of Phitsanulok, Northern Thailand, for the presence of AMR genes and in particular, mcr-1, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). In total, 48 mcr-1-positive isolates were recovered, consisting of 17 mcr-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (MCRPKP) and 31 mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) strains. The 17 MCRPKP were shown to be clonal (ST43) with few single poly nucleomorphs (SNPs) by WGS analysis. In in-vitro models, the MCRPKP were shown to be highly virulent. In contrast, 31 recovered MCRPEC isolates are varied, belonging to 12 different sequence types shared with those causing human infections. The majority of mcr-1 gene are located on IncX4 plasmids (29 / 48, 60.42%), sharing an identical plasmid backbone. These findings highlight the contribution of flies to the AMR contagion picture in low- and middle-income countries and the challenges of tackling global AMR. "
positive,"The insect ecdysone receptor is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control. RNA interference (RNAi) has great potential for use in insect pest control. However, some significant challenges must be overcome before RNAi-based pest control can become a reality. One challenge is the proper selection of a good target gene for RNAi. Here, we report that the insect ecdysone receptor (EcR) is a good potential target for RNAi-based pest control in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a serious insect pest of rice plants. We demonstrated that the use of a 360 bp fragment (NlEcR-c) that is common between NlEcR-A and NlEcR-B for feeding RNAi experiments significantly decreased the relative mRNA expression levels of NlEcR compared with those in the dsGFP control. Feeding RNAi also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of offspring per pair of N. lugens. Consequently, a transgenic rice line expressing NlEcR dsRNA was constructed by Agrobacterium- mediated transformation. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the total copy number of the target gene in all transgenic rice lines was 2. Northern blot analysis showed that the small RNA of the hairpin dsNlEcR-c was successfully expressed in the transgenic rice lines. After newly hatched nymphs of N. lugens fed on the transgenic rice lines, effective RNAi was observed. The NlEcR expression levels in all lines examined were decreased significantly compared with the control. In all lines, the survival rate of the nymphs was nearly 90%, and the average number of offspring per pair in the treated groups was significantly less than that observed in the control, with a decrease of 44.18-66.27%. These findings support an RNAi-based pest control strategy and are also important for the management of rice insect pests.  "
negative,"Genome-wide patterns of polymorphism in an inbred line of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Anopheles gambiae is a major mosquito vector of malaria in Africa. Although increased use of insecticide-based vector control tools has decreased malaria transmission, elimination is likely to require novel genetic control strategies. It can be argued that the absence of an A. gambiae inbred line has slowed progress toward genetic vector control. In order to empower genetic studies and enable precise and reproducible experimentation, we set out to create an inbred line of this species. We found that amenability to inbreeding varied between populations of A. gambiae. After full-sib inbreeding for ten generations, we genotyped 112 individuals--56 saved prior to inbreeding and 56 collected after inbreeding--at a genome-wide panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although inbreeding dramatically reduced diversity across much of the genome, we discovered numerous, discrete genomic blocks that maintained high heterozygosity. For one large genomic region, we were able to definitively show that high diversity is due to the persistent polymorphism of a chromosomal inversion. Inbred lines in other eukaryotes often exhibit a qualitatively similar retention of polymorphism when typed at a small number of markers. Our whole-genome SNP data provide the first strong, empirical evidence supporting associative overdominance as the mechanism maintaining higher than expected diversity in inbred lines. Although creation of A. gambiae lines devoid of nearly all polymorphism may not be feasible, our results provide critical insights into how more fully isogenic lines can be created. "
positive,"Systemic RNAi of V-ATPase subunit B causes molting defect and developmental abnormalities in Periplaneta fuliginosa. The vacuolar (H+ )-ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-driven proton pumps with multiple functions in many organisms. In this study, we performed structural and functional analysis of vha55 gene that encodes V-ATPase subunit B in the smokybrown cockroach Periplaneta fuliginosa (Blattodea). We observed a high homology score of the deduced amino acid sequences between 10 species in seven orders. RNAi of the vha55 gene in P. fuliginosa caused nymphal / nymphal molting defects with incomplete shedding of old cuticles, growth inhibition, as well as bent and wrinkled cuticles of thoraxes and abdominal segments. Since growth inhibition caused by vha55 RNAi did not interfere in the commencement of cockroach molting, molting timing and body growth might be controlled by independent mechanism. Our study suggested V-ATPases might be a good candidate molecule for evolutionary and developmental studies of insect molting. "
negative,"First genome analysis and molecular characterization of Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus Egyptian isolate infecting squash. This study aims to identifying and characterizing some molecular properties of geminiviruses co-infection in squash field crop cultivated in Egypt. Squash crops observed to be heavily infected with several insect vectors, also severe chlorosis and stunting was observed. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed geminate capsid particles which indicate the infection of Geminiviruses, especially SqLCV which represent an economic problem to squash filed crop in Egypt. We have investigated possible mixed infections with different plant viruses associated with chlorotic stunt diseases and or other genus groups of geminiviruses. The main objective of this study is to investigate the recombination events, possible recombinants and variants among these genera in the same family differing in vector transmission. This is the first report of the molecular characterization, phylogenetic analysis and putative recombination events of the full length genome of the Chickpea Chlorotic Dwarf Mastrevirus in Egypt. And the first report of co-infection with another begomovirus infecting squash plants. A full length clone of both viruses were isolated and characterized at the molecular level. The complete nucleotide sequence of DNA-A was determined (2,572 bp) and submitted to the genbank under accession no. KF692356. The isolate from Egypt has about 97.8 % homology with the Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV) isolate from Syria DNA-A isolate FR687959, a 83.2 % homology with the Sudan isolate AM933134 and a 82.7 % homology with Pakistan isolate FR687960. To best of our knowledge this is the first report of complete genome of CpCDV that infect squash plants in Egypt and worldwide.  "
positive,"Identification, expression and function of myosin heavy chain family genes in Tribolium castaneum. Functions of myosin heavy chain (myosin) family genes are poorly understood in some insects. To address this, we determined the expression and function of myosin family genes in Tribolium castaneum. TcMyo15 is predominantly expressed in early embryos, late larvae and early adults, but TcMyo7B transcripts significantly increased in late larvae. TcMyo20 transcripts are abundant in pre-adults, whereas TcMhc1 is highly expressed in post-embryonic stages. TcMhc2 shows peak expression in late pupae. TcMyo9 transcripts reached their highest levels in late pupae. TcMyo15, TcMyo7B and TcMhc2 are abundantly expressed in the adult epidermis, gut and testis, respectively. TcMyo9 and TcMyo20 are highly expressed in the epidermis, fat body and ovary, and TcMhc1 exhibits high mRNA levels in the epidermis and accessory gland. TcMyo20 RNAi reduced wing and leg size, fertility and egg hatchability. TcMyo9 knockdown completely inhibited eclosion and fecundity, but TcMyo15 or TcMhc1 silencing only impaired eclosion. TcMhc2 RNAi affected pupation and wing development. This study suggests myosin genes as potential targets of pesticides due to their critical roles in insect development and reproduction. "
negative,"Beet poleroviruses: close friends or distant relatives? UNLABELLED: SUMMARY Taxonomy: There are three members of the genus Polerovirus (family Luteoviridae) that induce yellowing of sugar beet: Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV), Beet chlorosis virus (BChV) and Beet western yellows virus-USA (BWYV-USA, Fig. 1). Non-beet-infecting isolates of BWYV found particularly within Europe have now been re-named Turnip yellows virus (TuYV). Species-specific antibodies are unavailable, but the viruses can be distinguished by RT-PCR using primers specifically designed to the 5' end of their respective genomes. Physical properties: The isometric virus particles are approximately 26 nm in diameter and the genome consists of a single strand of positive sense RNA that utilizes almost all known plant virus gene expression strategies (initiation bypass, translational frameshifting and readthrough, synthesis of subgenomic RNA and proteolytic processing). HOST RANGE: Many members of the Chenopodiaceae are susceptible, including commercial crops of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), red beet and spinach. Experimental hosts include Montia perfoliata, Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. SYMPTOMS: Sugar beet infected with beet poleroviruses show patches of chlorosis on the older leaves 4-6 weeks post-infection; these areas expand until the whole leaf becomes yellow and older leaves then tend to thicken and become brittle. TRANSMISSION: Beet poleroviruses are transmitted in a persistent (circulative, non-propagative) manner by several different aphid species, Myzus persicae being the most important vector. "
negative,"Analysis of ESTs from Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies and their contribution toward understanding the insect-parasite relationship. An expressed sequence tag library has been generated from a sand fly vector of visceral leishmaniasis, Lutzomyia longipalpis. A normalized cDNA library was constructed from whole adults and 16,608 clones were sequenced from both ends and assembled into 10,203 contigs and singlets. Of these 58% showed significant similarity to known genes from other organisms, <4% were identical to described sand fly genes, and 42% had no match to any database sequence. Our analyses revealed putative proteins involved in the barrier function of the gut (peritrophins, microvillar proteins, glutamine synthase), digestive physiology (secreted and membrane-anchored hydrolytic enzymes), and the immune response (gram-negative binding proteins, thioester proteins, scavenger receptors, galectins, signaling pathway factors, caspases, serpins, and peroxidases). Sequence analysis of this transcriptome dataset has provided new insights into genes that might be associated with the response of the vector to the development of Leishmania. "
positive,"An Overview of Embryogenesis: External Morphology and Transcriptome Profiling in the Hemipteran Insect Nilaparvata lugens. During embryogenesis of insects, the morphological and transcriptional changes are important signatures to obtain a better understanding of insect patterning and evolution. The brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is a serious insect pest of rice plants, but its embryogenesis has not uncovered. Here, we described embryonic development process of the pest and found it belongs to an intermediate-germ mode. The RNA-seq data from different times (6, 30, 96, and 150 h, after egg laying) of embryogenesis were then analyzed, and a total of 10,895 genes were determined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on pairwise comparisons. Afterward, 1,898 genes, differentially expressed in at least two comparisons of adjacent embryonic stages were divided into 10 clusters using K means cluster analysis (KMCA). Eight-gene modules were established using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression patterns in the different embryonic stages were identified by combining the functional enrichments of the stage-specific clusters and modules, which displayed the expression level and reprogramming of multiple developmental genes during embryogenesis. The ""hub"" genes at each embryonic stage with possible crucial roles were identified. Notably, we found a ""center"" set of genes that were related to overall membrane functions and might play important roles in the embryogenesis process. After parental RNAi of the MSTRG.3372, the hub gene, the embryo was observed as abnormal. Furthermore, some homologous genes in classic embryonic development processes and signaling pathways were also involved in embryogenesis of this insect. An improved comprehensive finding of embryogenesis within the N. lugens reveals better information on genetic and genomic studies of embryonic development and might be a potential target for RNAi-based control of this insect pest. "
positive,"Evaluation of potential RNA-interference-target genes to control cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcuidae). RNA interference (RNAi) of vital insect genes is a potential tool for targeted pest control. However, selection of the right target genes is a challenge because the RNAi efficacy is known to vary among insect species. Cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis, is a phloem-feeding economically important crop pest. We evaluated the RNAi of 2 vital genes, Bursicon (PsBur) and V-ATPase (PsV-ATPase) as potential targets in P. solenopsis for its control. PCR fragments of PsBur and PsV-ATPase were amplified using cDNA synthesized from the total RNA. The PCR amplicons were cloned into Potato virus X (PVX) to develop recombinant PVX for the inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum plants for bioassays with healthy P. solenopsis. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the expression of transgenes in the recombinant-PVX-inoculated plants (treated), and suppression of the target genes in the mealybugs exposed to them. The RT-PCR confirmed the expression of transgenes in the treated plants. Mealybug individuals on treated plants either died or showed physical deformities. Further, the population of mealybug was significantly reduced by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggers against PsBur and PsV-ATPase. The results conclude that RNAi is activated in P. solenopsis by feeding on N. tabacum expressing RNAi triggering elements of PsBur and PsV-ATPase genes through recombinant PVX vector. Further, V-ATPase and Bursicon genes are potential targets for RNAi-mediated control of P. solenopsis. "
negative,"EST-based gene indices for the cattle fever tick, the horn fly, and the screwworm fly. The southern cattle tick, Rhip,cephalus (Boophilus) microplus, the horn fly, Haematobia irritans, and the New World screwworm, Cochl,omyia hominivorax, are economically important parasites of cattle throughout the world. Understanding the biology and genomics of these pests is critical to developing novel control methods. We developed EST sequence databases for these parasites and used bioinformatic analysis to identify conceptual open reading frames and assigned Gene Ontology (GO) terms to those database transcripts that had informative BlasIX hits. Bloinformatic analysis showed that a large fraction of the tick database entries have no clear matches in other sequenced genomes. Several putative tick G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified that mightserve as starting points to develop novel control technologies. "
negative,"Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of odorant-binding proteins in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. Olfaction contributes to many crucial behaviors in insects, such as foraging, locating hosts, mating, and avoiding predators. In the first step of the olfaction process in insects, odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) bind with the odorants and transport hydrophobic odorants. OBPs are also believed to accelerate the termination of the odorant response. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is one of the most destructive fruit-eating pests, causing enormous economic losses to the fruit and vegetable industry worldwide. However, information relating to the number, diversity, and expression patterns of OBPs still remains fragmented in this insect pest. Here, we attempted to identify the OBPs in B. dorsalis using genomic and transcriptomic information. In this study, we expanded the repository of B. dorsalis OBPs to 49. Phylogenetic analysis of BdorOBPs with other species revealed that these proteins grouped into four subfamilies. Furthermore, we determined the expression profiles in six body parts (namely, the legs, wings, antenna, cuticles of the head, thorax, and abdomen) and five internal tissues (namely, the fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubule, testis, and ovary). The results indicated that 21 BdorOBPs showed high expression levels in the antenna, legs, and head cuticles and may thus perform olfactory functions, which corroborates previous evidence. Two BdorOBPs were specifically expressed in the abdomen cuticles. Nineteen OBPs were highly expressed in the fat body, while four OBPs were highly expressed in the reproductive organs. This indicated that they may have physiological roles other than in chemoreception. In summary, our results contribute to the knowledge base of insect OBPs and provide a foundation for the further study of the molecular mechanisms of chemoreception in B. dorsalis. "
positive,"NlATG1 Gene Participates in Regulating Autophagy and Fission of Mitochondria in the Brown Planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Autophagy plays multiple roles in regulating various physiological processes in cells. However, we currently lack a systematic analysis of autophagy and the autophagy-related gene 1 ATG1 in the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), one of the most destructive of the insect pests of rice. In this study, the full-length cDNA of an autophagy-related gene, NlATG1, was cloned from BPH. Real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that this NlATG1 gene was expressed differently across developmental stages, at higher levels in nymphs but lower levels in adults. RNA interference with dsNlATG1 significantly decreased the mRNA level of the target gene to 14.6% at day 4 compared with that of the dsGFP control group. The survival of the dsNlATG1-treated group decreased significantly from day 4 onward, dropping to 48.3% on day 8. Examination using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that epithelial cells of the BPH's midgut in the dsNlATG1-treated group had less autophagic vacuoles than did the dsGFP control, and knockdown of NlATG1 clearly inhibited the starvation-induced autophagy response in this insect. RNA interference of NlATG1 upregulated the NlFis1 gene involved in mitochondrial fission, leading to reductions in mitochondrial width and area. Furthermore, knockdown of NlATG1 also decreased the ATP content and accumulation of glycogen. Together, these results demonstrate that the NlATG1 gene participates in regulating autophagy and fission of mitochondria in the brown planthopper, making it a potentially promising target for pest control given its key role in autophagy, including maintaining the normal structure and function of mitochondria. "
negative,"Abundant nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) in the Aedes aegypti genome. A portion of the Aedes aegypti mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene (ND4) was amplified using PCR with a 42 degrees C annealing temperature. Amplified fragments from individual mosquitoes were similar to ND4 but contained multiple segregating sites. We suspected that nuclear copies of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs) exist in the Ae. aegypti genome. A BlastN search in VectorBase with the entire Ae. aegypti mitochondrial genome identified 233 NUMTs comprising 110 178 bp in 145 supercontigs. At a density of 0.080 bp / kb, this represents the second highest density of NUMTs in an insect genome and the highest in Diptera. Analyses of flanking sequences suggested that Ae. aegypti NUMTs arise through mtDNA leakage from damaged mitochondria followed by breakage and nonhomologous recombination, rather than through duplicative processes such as transposition or molecular drive. "
negative,"Genomic origins of insect sex chromosomes. Recent efforts to catalog the diversity of sex chromosome systems coupled with genome sequencing projects are adding a new level of resolution to our understanding of insect sex chromosome origins. Y-chromosome degeneration makes sequencing difficult and may erase homology so rapidly that their origins will often remain enigmatic. X-chromosome origins are better understood, but thus far prove to be remarkably labile, often lacking homology even among close relatives. Furthermore, evidence now suggests that differentiated X or Y-chromosomes may both revert to autosomal inheritance. Data for ZW systems is scarcer, but W and Y-chromosomes seem to share many characteristics. Limited evidence suggests that Z-chromosome homology is more conserved than X counterparts, but broader sampling of both sex chromosome systems is needed. "
negative,"Genomic consequences of background effects on scalloped mutant expressivity in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic background effects contribute to the phenotypic consequences of mutations and are pervasive across all domains of life that have been examined, yet little is known about how they modify genetic systems. In part this is due to the lack of tractable model systems that have been explicitly developed to study the genetic and evolutionary consequences of background effects. In this study we demonstrate that phenotypic expressivity of the scalloped(E3) (sd(E3)) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is background dependent and is the result of at least one major modifier segregating between two standard lab wild-type strains. We provide evidence that at least one of the modifiers is linked to the vestigial region and demonstrate that the background effects modify the spatial distribution of known sd target genes in a genotype-dependent manner. In addition, microarrays were used to examine the consequences of genetic background effects on the global transcriptome. Expression differences between wild-type strains were found to be as large as or larger than the effects of mutations with substantial phenotypic effects, and expression differences between wild type and mutant varied significantly between genetic backgrounds. Significantly, we demonstrate that the epistatic interaction between sd(E3) and an optomotor blind mutation is background dependent. The results are discussed within the context of developing a complex but more realistic view of the consequences of genetic background effects with respect to mutational analysis and studies of epistasis and cryptic genetic variation segregating in natural populations. "
positive,"Silencing of CYP6 and APN Genes Affects the Growth and Development of Rice Yellow Stem Borer, Scirpophaga incertulas. RNAi is a powerful tool to target the insect genes involved in host-pest interactions. Key insect genes are the choice for silencing to achieve pest derived resistance where resistance genes are not available in gene pool of host plant. In this study, an attempt was made to determine the effect of dsRNA designed from two genes Cytochrome P450 derivative (CYP6) and Aminopeptidase N (APN) of rice yellow stem borer (YSB) on growth and development of insect. The bioassays involved injection of chemically synthesized 5' FAM labeled 21-nt dsRNA into rice cut stems and allowing the larvae to feed on these stems which resulted in increased mortality and observed growth and development changes in larval length and weight compared with its untreated control at 12-15 days after treatment. These results were further supported by observing the reduction in transcripts expression of these genes in treated larvae. Fluorescence detection in treated larvae also proved that dsRNA was readily taken by larvae when fed on dsRNA treated stems. These results from the present study clearly show that YSB larvae fed on dsRNA designed from Cytochrome P450 and Aminopeptidase N has detrimental effect on larval growth and development. These genes can be deployed to develop YSB resistance in rice using RNAi approach.  "
negative,"Investigation of the contribution of RyR target-site mutations in diamide resistance by CRISPR / Cas9 genome modification in Drosophila. Diamide insecticides are used widely against lepidopteran pests, acting as potent activators of insect Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) and thus inducing muscle contraction and eventually death. However, resistant phenotypes have recently evolved in the field, associated with the emergence of target site resistance mutations (G4946E / V and I4790M). We investigated the frequency of the mutations found in a resistant population of Tuta absoluta from Greece (G4946V ~79% and I4790M ~21%) and the associated diamide resistance profile: there are very high levels of resistance against chlorantraniliprole (9329-fold) and flubendiamide (4969-fold), but moderate levels against cyantraniliprole (191-fold). To further investigate functionally the contribution of each mutation in the resistant phenotype, we used CRISPR / Cas9 to generate genome modified Drosophila carrying alternative allele combinations, and performed toxicity bioassays against all three diamides. Genome modified flies bearing the G4946V mutation exhibited high resistance ratios to flubendiamide (91.3-fold) and chlorantraniliprole (194.7-fold) when compared to cyantraniliprole (5.4-fold). Flies naturally wildtype for the I4790M mutation were moderately resistant to flubendiamide (15.3-fold) but significantly less resistant to chlorantraniliprole (7.5-fold), and cyantraniliprole (2.3-fold). These findings provide in vivo functional genetic confirmation for the role and relative contribution of RyR mutations in diamide resistance and suggest that the mutations confer subtle differences on the relative binding affinities of the three diamides at an overlapping binding site on the RyR protein. "
positive,"Genomic organization and regulation of three cecropin genes in Anopheles gambiae. Three cecropin genes (AgCecA-C) were identified from Anopheles gambiae, a major vector for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. These genes form a cluster with AgCecA and AgCecB positioned in opposite orientation, while AgCecC is downstream of AgCecA in the same direction. One intron is present in each of these three genes. Motif searches of promoter regions revealed elements that could be regulated by the NF-kappaB family of transcriptional regulators. The divergent promoter (1186 nucleotides in length) between CecA and CecB and the promoter for CecC were analysed by transfection in An. gambiae cell lines. Results showed that these promoters were up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide. The activity was further elevated when heat-inactivated microbes were used to challenge the cell line. At least one NF-kappaB site was required for inducible expression of both CecA and CecB. "
positive,"Cloning and characterization of a 70 kDa heat shock cognate gene (HSC70) from two species of Chironomus. In the present study we carried out the isolation and characterization of an HSC70 gene from two midges, Chironomus tentans and C. yoshimatsui. The HSC70 cDNAs are approximately 2424 (C. tentans) and 2464 bp (C. yoshimatsui) long, and contain 1950 and 1956 bp open reading frames, respectively. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of two introns in these genes. The 5' untranslated regions of the HSC70 genes are adenosine-rich, a feature found in inducible HSP70 genes. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences exhibit high identity with cytosolic HSC70s from other Dipterans. Northern hybridization indicated that HSC70 is expressed at all developmental stages, from embryo to adult, and Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of multiple HSP70 genes in Chironomus. "
negative,"Inheritance of resistance to acrinathrin in Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). BACKGROUND: The western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is an economically important pest. The genetic basis of acrinathrin resistance was investigated in WFT. RESULTS: The resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for acrinathrin resistance from a pool of thrips populations collected in Almeria (south-eastern Spain), showed a high resistance to acrinathrin (43-fold based on LC(50) values) compared with the laboratory susceptible strain. Mortality data from reciprocal crosses of resistant and susceptible thrips indicated that resistance was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects. Analysis of probit lines from the parental strains and reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was expressed as a codominant trait. To determine the number of genes involved, a direct test of monogenic inheritance based on the backcrosses suggested that resistance to acrinathrin was probably controlled by one locus. Another approach, which was based on phenotypic variances, showed n(E), or the minimum number of freely segregating genetic factors for the resistant strain, to be 0.79. CONCLUSION: The results showed that acrinathrin resistance in WFT was autosomal and not influenced by maternal effects, and was expressed as a codominant trait, probably controlled by one locus. "
negative,"Molecular and genomic basis of volatile-mediated indirect defense against insects in rice. Rice plants fed on by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) caterpillars emit a blend of volatiles dominated by terpenoids. These volatiles were highly attractive to females of the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Microarray analysis identified 196 rice genes whose expression was significantly upregulated by FAW feeding, 18 of which encode metabolic enzymes potentially involved in volatile biosynthesis. Significant induction of expression of seven of the 11 terpene synthase (TPS) genes identified through the microarray experiments was confirmd using real-time RT-PCR. Enzymes encoded by three TPS genes, Os02g02930, Os08g07100 and Os08g04500, were biochemically characterized. Os02g02930 was found to encode a monoterpene synthase producing the single product S-linalool, which is the most abundant volatile emitted from FAW-damaged rice plants. Both Os08g07100 and Os08g04500 were found to encode sesquiterpene synthases, each producing multiple products. These three enzymes are responsible for production of the majority of the terpenes released from FAW-damaged rice plants. In addition to TPS genes, several key genes in the upstream terpenoid pathways were also found to be upregulated by FAW feeding. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of FAW-induced volatiles and the corresponding volatile biosynthetic genes potentially involved in indirect defense in rice. Evolution of the genetic basis governing volatile terpenoid biosynthesis for indirect defense is discussed. "
positive,"Characterisation, analysis of expression and localisation of the opsin gene repertoire from the perspective of photoperiodism in the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Organisms exhibit a wide range of seasonal responses as adaptions to predictable annual changes in their environment. These changes are originally caused by the effect of the Earth's cycles around the sun and its axial tilt. Examples of seasonal responses include floration, migration, reproduction and diapause. In temperate climate zones, the most robust variable to predict seasons is the length of the day (i.e. the photoperiod). The first step to trigger photoperiodic driven responses involves measuring the duration of the light-dark phases, but the molecular clockwork performing this task is poorly characterized. Photopigments such as opsins are known to participate in light perception, being part of the machinery in charge of providing information about the luminous state of the surroundings. Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are paradigmatic photoperiodic insects, exhibiting a strong induction to diapause when the light regime mimics autumn conditions. The availability of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome has facilitated molecular approaches to understand the effect of light stimulus in the photoperiodic induction process. We have identified, experimentally validated and characterized the expression of the full opsin gene repertoire in the pea aphid. Among identified opsin genes in A. pisum, arthropsin is absent in most insects sequenced to date (except for dragonflies and two other hemipterans) but also present in a crustacean, an onychophoran and chelicerates. We have quantified the expression of these genes in aphids exposed to different photoperiodic conditions and at different times of the day and localized their transcripts in the aphid brain. Clear differences in expression patterns were found, thus relating opsin expression with the photoperiodic response. "
negative,"Identification of insect genes involved in baculovirus AcMNPV entry into insect cells. The baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is a model enveloped DNA virus that infects and replicates in lepidopteran insect cells, and can efficiently enter a wide variety of non-host cells. Budded virions of AcMNPV enter cells by endocytosis and traffic to the nucleus where the virus initiates gene expression and genome replication. While trafficking of nucleocapsids by actin propulsion has been studied in detail, other important components of trafficking during entry remain poorly understood. We used a recombinant AcMNPV virus expressing an EGFP reporter in combination with an RNAi screen in Drosophila DL1 cells, to identify host proteins involved in AcMNPV entry. The RNAi screen targeted 86 genes involved in vesicular trafficking, including genes coding for VPS and ESCRT proteins, Rab GTPases, Exocyst proteins, and Clathrin adaptor proteins. We identified 24 genes required for efficient virus entry and reporter expression, and 4 genes that appear to restrict virus entry. "
positive,"Metabolism of selected model substrates and insecticides by recombinant CYP6FD encoded by its gene predominately expressed in the brain of Locusta migratoria. The migratory locust, Locusta migartoria, is a major agricultural insect pest and its resistance to insecticides is becoming more prevalent. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are important enzymes for biotransformations of various endogenous and xenobiotic substances. These enzymes play a major role in developing insecticide resistance in many insect species. In this study, we heterologously co-expressed a CYP enzyme (CYP6FD1) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from L. migartoria in Sf9 insect cells. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for metabolic activity towards six selected model substrates (luciferin-H, luciferin-Me, luciferin-Be, luciferin-PFBE, luciferin-CEE and 7-ethoxycoumarin), and four selected insecticides (deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and methoprene). Recombinant CYP6FD1 showed activity towards 7-ethoxycoumarin and luciferin-Me, but no detectable activity towards the other luciferin derivatives. Furthermore, the enzyme efficiently oxidized deltamethrin to hydroxydeltamethrin through an aromatic hydroxylation in a time-dependent manner. However, the enzyme did not show any detectable activity towards the other three insecticides. Our results provide direct evidence that CYP6FD1 is capable of metabolizing deltamethrin. This work is a step towards a more complete characterization of the catalytic capabilities of CYP6FD1 and other xenobiotic metabolizing CYP enzymes in L. migratoria. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis HS18-1. Bacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium that is a type of insect pathogen used in the field of microbial insect control. B. thuringiensis HS18-1 has effective toxicity for Lepidoptera and Diptera insects. It contains different types of parasporal crystal genes, including cry4Cb1, cry50Aa1, cry69Ab1, cry30Ga, cry30Ea, cry70Aa, cry71Aa, cry72Aa, cry56Aa and cry54Ba. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of B. thuringiensis HS18-1, which contains one circular gapless chromosome and nine circular plasmids.  "
negative,"Transcriptomics and functional genomics of plant defence induction by phloem-feeding insects. The relationship between phloem-feeding insects (PFIs) and plants offers an intriguing example of a highly specialized biotic interaction. These insects have evolved to survive on a nutritionally imbalanced diet of phloem sap, and to minimize wound responses in their host plants. As a consequence, plant perception of and responses to PFIs differ from plant interactions with other insect-feeding guilds. Transcriptome-wide analyses of gene expression are currently being applied to characterize plant responses to PFIs in crop plants with race-specific innate resistance, as well as in compatible interactions with susceptible hosts. Recent studies indicate that PFIs induce transcriptional reprogramming in their host plants, and that plant responses to PFIs appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively different from responses to other insects or pathogens. Transcript profiling studies also suggest that PFIs induce cell wall modifications, reduce photosynthetic activity, manipulate source-sink relations, and modify secondary metabolism in their hosts, and many of these responses appear to occur within the phloem tissue. Plant responses to these insects appear to be regulated in part by the salicylate, jasmonate, and ethylene signalling pathways. As additional transcript profiling data become available, forward and reverse genetic approaches will be necessary to determine which changes in gene expression influence resistance or susceptibility to PFIs. "
negative,"The mitochondrial genome of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). The entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule was 15,314 bp long. The C. raphaelis genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely sequenced mitogenomes of other lepidopteran species, except for the presence of an extra copy of tRNA(Ser)(AGN). High similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between the two tandemly located copies of the tRNA(Ser)(AGN) suggest a recent duplication of an original single tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The DHU arm of the two copies of tRNA(Ser)(AGN) formed a simple loop as seen in many other metazoan mt tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The putative initiation codon for the C. raphaelis COI gene appears to be a tetranucleotide, TTAG, found commonly in the sequenced lepidopterans. ATPase8, ATPase6, ND4L and ND6 genes, which are next to another protein-coding gene at their 3' end all had the sequences potential to form a hairpin structure, suggesting the importance of such a structure for precise cleavage of the mature protein-coding genes. "
positive,"Functional characterization of ultraspiracle in Leptinotarsa decemlineata using RNA interference assay. A heterodimer of ultraspiracle (USP) and ecdysone receptor (EcR) mediates 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signalling cascade to regulate insect moulting and metamorphosis. However, at least two questions remain to be addressed in terms of the molecular importance of USP in insect species. First, is USP involved in both regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis and mediation of 20E signalling in non-drosophilid insects, as in Drosophila melanogaster? Second, does USP play any role in larval metamorphosis except as the partner of heterodimeric receptor to activate the downstream 20E signalling genes? In this paper, we found that RNA interference (RNAi) of LdUSP in the final (fourth) instar larvae reduced the messenger RNA levels of four ecdysteroidogenesis genes (Ldspo, Ldphm, Lddib and Ldsad) and 20E titre, and repressed the expression of five 20E signal genes (EcRA, HR3, HR4, E74 and E75) in Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The LdUSP RNAi larvae remained as prepupae, with developing antennae, legs and discs of forewings and hindwings. Dietary supplement with 20E restored the expression of the five 20E signal genes, but only partially alleviated the decreased pupation rate in LdUSP RNAi beetles. Knockdown of LdUSP at the penultimate (third) instar larvae did not affect third-fourth instar moulting. However, silencing LdUSP caused similar but less severe impairments on pupation. Accordingly, we propose that USP is undoubtedly necessary for ecdysteroidogenesis, for mediation of 20E signalling and for initiation of metamorphosis in L. decemlineata. "
negative,"A genome-scale protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 uncovers additional nodes of the human p53 network. The genome of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a single p53-like protein, phylogenetically related to the ancestor of the mammalian p53 family of tumor suppressors. We reasoned that a comprehensive map of the protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) might help identify conserved interactions of the entire p53 family in man. Using a genome-scale in vitro expression cloning approach, we identified 91 previously unreported Dmp53 interactors, considerably expanding the current Drosophila p53 interactome. Looking for evolutionary conservation of these interactions, we tested 41 mammalian orthologs and found that 37 bound to one or more p53-family members when overexpressed in human cells. An RNAi-based functional assay for modulation of the p53 pathway returned five positive hits, validating the biological relevance of these interactions. One p53 interactor is GTPBP4, a nucleolar protein involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that GTPBP4 knockdown induces p53 accumulation and activation in the absence of nucleolar disruption. In breast tumors with wild-type p53, increased expression of GTPBP4 correlates with reduced patient survival, emphasizing a potential relevance of this regulatory axis in cancer. "
negative,"Evolutionary and functional genetics of insect diapause: a call for greater integration. Diapause in response to seasonality is an important model for rapid evolutionary adaptation that is highly genetically variable, and experiences strong natural selection. Forward genetic methods using various genomic and transcriptomic approaches have begun to characterize the genetic architecture and candidate genes underlying diapause evolution. Largely in parallel, reverse genetic studies have identified functional roles for candidate genes that may or may not be genetically variable. We illustrate the disconnect between the evolutionary and physiological literature using a suite of studies of the role of the circadian clock in diapause regulation. These extensive studies in two different disciplines provide excellent opportunities for integration, which should facilitate rapid progress in understanding both the regulation and evolution of diapause. "
negative,"The evolution of novel host use is unlikely to be constrained by trade-offs or a lack of genetic variation. The genetic and ecological factors that shape the evolution of animal diets remain poorly understood. For herbivorous insects, the expectation has been that trade-offs exist, such that adaptation to one host plant reduces performance on other potential hosts. We investigated the genetic architecture of alternative host use by rearing individual Lycaeides melissa butterflies from two wild populations in a crossed design on two hosts (one native and one introduced) and analysing the genetic basis of differences in performance using genomic approaches. Survival during the experiment was highest when butterfly larvae were reared on their natal host plant, consistent with local adaptation. However, cross-host correlations in performance among families (within populations) were not different from zero. We found that L. melissa populations possess genetic variation for larval performance and variation in performance had a polygenic basis. We documented very few genetic variants with trade-offs that would inherently constrain diet breadth by preventing the optimization of performance across hosts. Instead, most genetic variants that affected performance on one host had little to no effect on the other host. In total, these results suggest that genetic trade-offs are not the primary cause of dietary specialization in L. melissa butterflies.  "
negative,"Studying the organization of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes in Chrysomela tremula provides insights into a leaf beetle genome. The ability of herbivorous beetles from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides has only recently begun to be appreciated. The presence of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in the beetle's digestive tract makes this degradation possible. Sequences encoding these beetle-derived PCWDEs were originally identified from transcriptomes and strikingly resemble those of saprophytic and phytopathogenic microorganisms, raising questions about their origin; e.g. are they insect- or microorganism-derived? To demonstrate unambiguously that the genes encoding PCWDEs found in beetle transcriptomes are indeed of insect origin, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the genome of the leaf beetle Chrysomela tremula, containing 18 432 clones with an average size of 143 kb. After hybridizing this library with probes derived from 12 C. tremula PCWDE-encoding genes and sequencing the positive clones, we demonstrated that the latter genes are encoded by the insect's genome and are surrounded by genes possessing orthologues in the genome of Tribolium castaneum as well as in three other beetle genomes. Our analyses showed that although the level of overall synteny between C. tremula and T. castaneum seems high, the degree of microsynteny between both species is relatively low, in contrast to the more closely related Colorado potato beetle.  "
negative,"An Anopheles stephensi Promoter-Trap: Augmenting Genome Annotation and Functional Genomics. The piggyBac transposon was modified to generate gene trap constructs, which were then incorporated into the genome of the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi and remobilized through genetic crosses using a piggyBac transposase expressing line. A total of 620 remobilization events were documented, and 73 were further characterized at the DNA level to identify patterns in insertion site preferences, remobilization frequencies, and remobilization patterns. Overall, the use of the tetameric AmCyan reporter as the fusion peptide displayed a preference for insertion into the 5'-end of transcripts. Notably 183 - 44882 bp upstream of the An. stephensi v1.0 ab initio gene models, which demonstrated that the promoter regions for the genes of An. stephensi are further upstream of the 5'-proximal regions of the genes in the ab inito models than may be otherwise predicted. RNA-Seq transcript coverage supported the insertion of the splice acceptor gene trap element into 5'-UTR introns for nearly half of all insertions identified. The use of a gene trap element that prefers insertion into the 5'-end of genes supports the use of this technology for the random generation of knock-out mutants, as well as the experimental confirmation of 5'-UTR introns in An. stephensi. "
positive,"Odorant reception in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor (AgOr) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets for controlling the transmission of malaria. "
negative,"Where the baculoviruses lead, the caterpillars follow: baculovirus-induced alterations in caterpillar behaviour. Baculoviruses are well-known for altering the behaviour of their caterpillar hosts by inducing hyperactivity (enhanced locomotion) and / or tree-top disease (climbing to elevated positions before death). These features, along with the genomic small size of baculoviruses compared to non-viral parasites and the at hand techniques for producing mutants, imply that baculoviruses are excellent tools for unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying parasitic alteration of host behaviour. Baculoviruses can be easily mutated, allowing an optimal experimental setup in comparative studies, where for instance host gene expression can be compared between insects infected with wild-type viruses or with mutant viruses lacking genes involved in behavioural manipulation. Recent studies have revealed the first insight into the underlying molecular pathways that lead to the typical behaviour of baculovirus-infected caterpillars and into the role of light therein. Since host behaviour in general is mediated through the host's central nervous system (CNS), a promising future step will be to study how baculoviruses regulate the neuronal activity of the host. "
positive,"Hh signaling from de novo organizers drive lgl neoplasia in Drosophila epithelium. The Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen regulates growth and patterning. Since Hh signaling is also implicated in carcinogenesis, it is conceivable that de novo Hh-secreting organizers, if formed in association with oncogenic hit could be tumor-cooperative. Here we validate this hypothesis using the Drosophila model of cooperative epithelial carcinogenesis. We generate somatic clones with simultaneous loss of tumor suppressor, Lgl, and gain of the posterior compartment selector, Engrailed (En), known to induce synthesis of Hh. We show that lgl UAS-en clones in the anterior wing compartment trigger Hh signaling cascade via cross-talk with their Ci-expressing wild type cell neighbors. Hh-Dpp signaling from clone boundaries of such ectopically formed de novo organizers in turn drive lgl carcinogenesis. By contrast, Ci-expressing lgl clones transform by autocrine and / or juxtracine activation of Hh signaling in only the posterior compartment. We further show that sequestration of the Hh ligand or loss of Dpp receptor, Tkv, in these Hh-sending or -receiving lgl clones arrested their carcinogenesis. Our results therefore reveal a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of tumor cooperation by developmental organizers, which are induced fortuitously by oncogenic hits. "
negative,"Identification of ion channel genes in the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome. Aphids are major pests of crops, causing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage annually. Ion channel proteins are often the targets of modern insecticides and mutations in ion channel genes can lead to resistance to many leading classes of insecticides. The sequencing of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, genome has now allowed detailed in silico analysis of the aphid ion channels. The study has revealed significant differences in the composition of the ion channel families between the aphid and other insects. For example A. pisum does not appear to contain a homologue of the nACh receptor alpha 5 gene whilst the calcium channel beta subunit has been duplicated. These variations could result in differences in function or sensitivity to insecticides. The genome sequence will allow the study of aphid ion channels to be accelerated, leading to a better understanding of the function of these economically important channels. The potential for identifying novel insecticide targets within the aphid is now a step closer. "
positive,"Comparative analysis of C-type lectin domain proteins in the ghost moth, Thitarodes xiaojinensis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae). Insects have a large family of C-type lectins involved in cell adhesion, pathogen recognition and activation of immune responses. In this study, 32 transcripts encoding C-type lectin domain proteins (CTLDPs) were identified from the Thitarodes xiaojinensis transcriptome. According to their domain structures, six CTLDPs with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) were classified into the CTL-S subfamily. The other 23 CTLDPs with two CRDs were grouped into the immulectin (IML) subfamily. The remaining three with extra regulatory domains were sorted into the CTL-X subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CTL-S and CTL-X members from different insects could form orthologous groups. In contrast, no T. xiaojinensis IML orthologues were found in other insects. Remarkable lineage-specific expansion in this subfamily was observed reflecting that these CTLDPs, as important receptors, have evolved diversified members in response to a variety of microbes. Prediction of binding ligands revealed that T. xiaojinensis, a cold-adapted species, conserved the ability of CRDs to combine with Ca2+ to keep its receptors from freezing. Comparative analysis of induction of CTLDP genes after different immune challenges indicated that IMLs might play critical roles in immune defenses. This study examined T. xiaojinensis CTLDPs and provides a basis for further studies of their characteristics. "
negative,"Transcriptomic study of the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus embryogenesis. The red palm weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an invasive, concealed and destructive tissue borer, and it becomes a lethal pest of the palm family of plants and has been reported to attack 20 palm species around the globe. Here we report a systematic transcriptomic study on embryogenesis of RPW, where we analyze the transcriptomes across five developmental stages of RPW embryogenesis, involving four embryonic stages (E1, E2, E3 and E4) and one larval stage (L1). Using the RNA-seq and next-generation platforms, we generated 80 to 91 million reads for each library and assemble 22 532 genes that are expressed at different embryonic stages. Among the total transcripts from the five embryonic development stages, we found that 30.45 % are differentially expressed, 10.10 % show stage-specificity and even a larger fraction, 62.88 %, exhibit constitutive expression in all the stages. We also analyzes the expression dynamics of several conserved signaling pathways (such as Hedgehog, JAK-STAT, Notch, TGF-β, Ras / MAPK and Wnt), as well as key developmental genes, including those related to apoptosis, axis formation, Hox complex, neurogenesis and segmentation. The datasets provide an essential resource for gene annotation and RPW functional genomics, including studies by using tools and concepts from multiple disciplines, such as development, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics.  "
negative,"A genome-wide survey of small interfering RNA and microRNA pathway genes in a galling insect. Deployment of resistance (R) genes is the most effective control for Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say); however, deployment of R genes results in an increased frequency of pest genotypes that display virulence to them. RNA interference (RNAi) is a useful reverse genetics tool for studying such insect virulence pathways, but requires a systemic phenotype, which is not found in all species. In an effort to correlate our observed weak RNAi phenotype in M. destructor with a genetic basis, we have aggregated and compared RNAi related genes across M. destructor, three other insect species, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here the annotation of the core genes in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathways in M. destructor. While most of the miRNA pathway genes were highly conserved across the species studied, the siRNA pathway genes showed increased relative variability in comparison to the miRNA pathway. In particular, the Piwi / Argonaute / Zwille (PAZ) domain of Dicer-2 (DCR-2) had the least amount of sequence similarity of any domain among species surveyed, with a trend of increased conservation in those species with amenable systemic RNAi. A homolog of the systemic interference defective-1 (Sid-1) gene of C. elegans was also not annotated in the M. destructor genome. Indeed, it is of interest that a Sid-1 homolog has not been detected in any dipteran species to date. We hypothesize the sequence architecture of the PAZ domain in the M. destructor DCR-2 protein is related to reduced efficacy of this enzyme and this taken together with the lack of a Sid-1 homolog may account for the weak RNAi response observed to date in this species as well as other dipteran species. "
negative,"BmiGI: a database of cDNAs expressed in Boophilus microplus, the tropical / southern cattle tick. We used an expressed sequence tag approach to initiate a study of the genome of the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. A normalized cDNA library was synthesized from pooled RNA purified from tick larvae which had been subjected to different treatments, including acaricide exposure, heat shock, cold shock, host odor, and infection with Babesia bovis. For the acaricide exposure experiments, we used several strains of ticks, which varied in their levels of susceptibility to pyrethroid, organophosphate and amitraz. We also included RNA purified from samples of eggs, nymphs and adult ticks and dissected tick organs. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 11,520 cDNA clones and both 5' and 3' sequencing performed on each clone. The sequence data was used to search public protein databases and a B. microplus gene index was constructed, consisting of 8270 unique sequences whose associated putative functional assignments, when available, can be viewed at the TIGR website (http: /  / www.tigr.org / tdb / tgi). A number of novel sequences were identified which possessed significant sequence similarity to genes, which might be involved in resistance to acaricides. "
positive,"Egf-like gene is essential for cuticle metabolism in the brown planthopper. Using the mass spectrometry analysis of cuticle casts of brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and transcriptome analysis of BPH tissues, we identified a gigantic gene (50,922 bp, 16,973 aa) tentatively called Nlegf-like. Multiple transcripts were found. Nlegf-like encodes an integral membrane protein of 16,973 amino acid residues with 260 EGF-like repeats and 16 Ca2+-binding EGF repeats type (cbEGFs) in the extracellular portion. Nlegf-like was highly expressed in the integument and tended to peak at the middle stage or late stage of each nymph instar. Phylogenetic analysis showed this gene is conserved in many other insects. Different double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting eight different regions of the Nlegf-like gene resulted in abnormal cuticle formation or molting and lethal phenotypes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the newly formed endocuticle was significantly thinner for RNAi-treated BPHs with phenotype of contracted abdomen, or the old cuticle could not be digested sufficiently for those with phenotype of slender body shape or died with molting difficulty when compared with the control group. We suggest that the Nlegf-like is crucial for metabolism of the cuticle in BPH molting. "
negative,"The complete mitochondrial genome of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica Stainton (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was determined as a circular molecular of 15,273 bp in size. The mitogenome composition (37 genes) and gene order are the same as the other lepidopterans. Nucleotide composition of the C. cephalonica mitogenome is highly A+T biased (80.43%) like other insects. Twelve protein-coding genes start with a typical ATN codon, with the exception of coxl gene, which uses CGA as the initial codon. Nine protein-coding genes have the common stop codon TAA, and the nad2, cox1, cox2, and nad4 have single T as the incomplete stop codon. 22 tRNA genes demonstrated cloverleaf secondary structure. The mitogenome has several large intergenic spacer regions, the spacer1 between trnQ gene and nad2 gene, which is common in Lepidoptera. The spacer 3 between trnE and trnF includes microsatellite-like repeat regions (AT)18 and (TTAT)(3). The spacer 4 (16 bp) between trnS2 gene and nad1 gene has a motif ATACTAT; another species, Sesamia inferens encodes ATCATAT at the same position, while other lepidopteran insects encode a similar ATACTAA motif. The spacer 6 is A+T rich region, include motif ATAGA and a 20-bp poly(T) stretch and two microsatellite (AT)(9), (AT)(8) elements. "
negative,"Genomic analysis of ""Elusimicrobium minutum,"" the first cultivated representative of the phylum ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly termite group 1). Organisms of the candidate phylum termite group 1 (TG1) are regularly encountered in termite hindguts but are present also in many other habitats. Here, we report the complete genome sequence (1.64 Mbp) of ""Elusimicrobium minutum"" strain Pei191(T), the first cultured representative of the TG1 phylum. We reconstructed the metabolism of this strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from a beetle larva gut, and we discuss the findings in light of physiological data. E. minutum has all genes required for uptake and fermentation of sugars via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, including several hydrogenases, and an unusual peptide degradation pathway comprising transamination reactions and leading to the formation of alanine, which is excreted in substantial amounts. The presence of genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the presence of a pathway for peptidoglycan formation are consistent with ultrastructural evidence of a gram-negative cell envelope. Even though electron micrographs showed no cell appendages, the genome encodes many genes putatively involved in pilus assembly. We assigned some to a type II secretion system, but the function of 60 pilE-like genes remains unknown. Numerous genes with hypothetical functions, e.g., polyketide synthesis, nonribosomal peptide synthesis, antibiotic transport, and oxygen stress protection, indicate the presence of hitherto undiscovered physiological traits. Comparative analysis of 22 concatenated single-copy marker genes corroborated the status of ""Elusimicrobia"" (formerly TG1) as a separate phylum in the bacterial domain, which was so far based only on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. "
negative,"Functional consequences of mutations in the Drosophila histamine receptor HCLB. The gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in hclB lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of hclB in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two D. melanogaster mutants, hclB(T1) (P293S) and hclB(T2) (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41 degrees C, the hclB(T2) flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the hclB(T1) flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in hclB(T1) after anaesthesia with halothane. Enhanced synaptic signalling at low-intensity light stimuli was registered on electroretinograms recorded from the two mutant strains. Our results suggest that HCLB may play an essential and conserved role in insect neurophysiology. "
negative,"Applications of genome editing in insects. Insect genome editing was first reported 1991 in Drosophila melanogaster but the technology used was not portable to other species. Not until the recent development of facile, engineered DNA endonuclease systems has gene editing become widely available to insect scientists. Most applications in insects to date have been technical in nature but this is rapidly changing. Functional genomics and genetics-based insect control efforts will be major beneficiaries of the application of contemporary gene editing technologies. Engineered endonucleases like Cas9 make it possible to create powerful and effective gene drive systems that could be used to reduce or even eradicate specific insect populations. 'Best practices' for using Cas9-based editing are beginning to emerge making it easier and more effective to design and use but gene editing technologies still require traditional means of delivery in order to introduce them into somatic and germ cells of insects-microinjection of developing embryos. This constrains the use of these technologies by insect scientists. Insects created using editing technologies challenge existing governmental regulatory structures designed to manage genetically modified organisms. "
negative,"Comparative analysis of serine protease-related genes in the honey bee genome: possible involvement in embryonic development and innate immunity. We have identified 44 serine protease (SP) and 13 serine protease homolog (SPH) genes in the genome of Apis mellifera. Most of these genes encode putative secreted proteins, but four SPs and three SPHs may associate with the plasma membrane via a transmembrane region. Clip domains represent the most abundant non-catalytic structural units in these SP-like proteins -12 SPs and six SPHs contain at least one clip domain. Some of the family members contain other modules for protein-protein interactions, including disulphide-stabilized structures (LDL(r)A, SRCR, frizzled, kringle, Sushi, Wonton and Pan / apple), carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type lectin and chitin-binding), and other modules (such as zinc finger, CUB, coiled coil and Sina). Comparison of the sequences with those from Drosophila led to a proposed SP pathway for establishing the dorsoventral axis of honey bee embryos. Multiple sequence alignments revealed evolutionary relationships of honey bee SPs and SPHs with those in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Manduca sexta. We identified homologs of D. melanogaster persephone, M. sexta HP14, PAP-1 and SPH-1. A. mellifera genome includes at least five genes for potential SP inhibitors (serpin-1 through -5) and three genes of SP putative substrates (prophenoloxidase, spätzle-1 and spätzle-2). Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed an elevation in the mRNA levels of SP2, SP3, SP9, SP10, SPH41, SPH42, SP49, serpin-2, serpin-4, serpin-5, and spätzle-2 in adults after a microbial challenge. The SP41 and SP6 transcripts significantly increased after an injection of Paenibacillus larva, but there was no such increase after injection of saline or Escherichia coli. mRNA levels of most SPs and serpins significantly increased by 48 h after the pathogen infection in 1st instar larvae. On the contrary, SP1, SP3, SP19 and serpin-5 transcript levels reduced. These results, taken together, provide a framework for designing experimental studies of the roles of SPs and related proteins in embryonic development and immune responses of A. mellifera. "
negative,"Whole transcriptome responses among females of the filariasis and arbovirus vector mosquito Culex pipiens implicate TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification as key drivers of diapause induction. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are important disease vectors inhabiting temperate zones, worldwide. The seasonal reduction in temperature and photoperiod accompanying late summer and early fall prompts female mosquitoes to enter diapause, a stage of developmental arrest and physiological conditioning that enhances survival during the winter months. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying diapause induction, we used custom whole transcriptome microarrays to identify differences in gene expression following exposure to nondiapause (long days, 25 °C) and diapause-inducing (short days, 18 °C) environmental conditions. Using a two-way ANOVA, we identified 1130 genes that were differentially expressed. We used the expression of these genes across three time points to construct a gene co-expression network comprising five modules. Genes in modules 1, 2, and 3 were largely up-regulated, while genes in modules 4 and 5 were down-regulated when compared to nondiapause conditions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the network modules revealed some potential regulatory mechanisms driving diapause induction. Module 1 was enriched for genes in the TGF-ß and Wnt signaling pathways; module 2 was enriched for genes involved in insect hormone biosynthesis, specifically, ecdysone synthesis; module 3 was enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification; and module 5 was enriched for genes in the circadian rhythm pathway. Our results suggest that TGF-β signaling and chromatin modification are key drivers for the integration of environmental signals into the diapause induction phase in C. pipiens mosquitoes. "
negative,"Complete DNA sequence of Kuraishia capsulata illustrates novel genomic features among budding yeasts (Saccharomycotina). The numerous yeast genome sequences presently available provide a rich source of information for functional as well as evolutionary genomics but unequally cover the large phylogenetic diversity of extant yeasts. We present here the complete sequence of the nuclear genome of the haploid-type strain of Kuraishia capsulata (CBS1993(T)), a nitrate-assimilating Saccharomycetales of uncertain taxonomy, isolated from tunnels of insect larvae underneath coniferous barks and characterized by its copious production of extracellular polysaccharides. The sequence is composed of seven scaffolds, one per chromosome, totaling 11.4 Mb and containing 6,029 protein-coding genes, ~13.5% of which being interrupted by introns. This GC-rich yeast genome (45.7%) appears phylogenetically related with the few other nitrate-assimilating yeasts sequenced so far, Ogataea polymorpha, O. parapolymorpha, and Dekkera bruxellensis, with which it shares a very reduced number of tRNA genes, a novel tRNA sparing strategy, and a common nitrate assimilation cluster, three specific features to this group of yeasts. Centromeres were recognized in GC-poor troughs of each scaffold. The strain bears MAT alpha genes at a single MAT locus and presents a significant degree of conservation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, suggesting that it can perform sexual cycles in nature, although genes involved in meiosis were not all recognized. The complete absence of conservation of synteny between K. capsulata and any other yeast genome described so far, including the three other nitrate-assimilating species, validates the interest of this species for long-range evolutionary genomic studies among Saccharomycotina yeasts. "
negative,"Gene expression changes governing extreme dehydration tolerance in an Antarctic insect. Among terrestrial organisms, arthropods are especially susceptible to dehydration, given their small body size and high surface area to volume ratio. This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable for much of the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to quantify transcriptional mechanisms of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world's southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70% of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and ATP production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct transcriptional mechanisms to cope with similar desiccating conditions. "
positive,"Structure and evolution of the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE) gene from the firefly Photinus pyralis. To study the structural features of genes for the luciferin-regenerating enzyme (LRE), the entire gene along with 524 bp of upstream sequence was determined from Photinus pyralis (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). The LRE gene revealed an open reading frame composed of five exons divided by four introns ranging in size from 47 to 904 bp. The deduced LRE amino acid sequence showed identity to senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) from a number of insects and mammals including four putative SMP30 sequences from Anopheles gambiae. Gene structure comparisons showed some intron / exon site conservation with A. gambiae and mammalian SMP30 proteins but not Drosophila. LRE and luciferase sequence comparisons revealed two conserved putative luciferin-binding sites. The evolution of LRE was discussed in relation to its function. "
positive,"Translational and transcriptional control elements in the untranslated leader of the heat-shock gene hsp22. Downstream of the transcription start site in the Drosophila heat-shock gene hsp22, we have identified a region that is necessary for efficient transcription, and also for selective translation during heat shock. We assayed the expression of mutated genes after P-factor-mediated insertion into the genome. Deletions within the first 26 nucleotides block the preferential translation of hsp22 mRNA at high temperature. The rate of transcription is also decreased, though transcription is still heat-inducible. Leaving this region intact, up to 86% of the leader can be deleted without affecting translation or transcription. The functional region coincides with a region of sequence homology between the heat-shock genes. Only partial homology is found to a conserved sequence, ATCAGTTCT, found at the very 5' end of other insect genes. "
positive,"Hunchback knockdown induces supernumerary segment formation in Bombyx. Insect segment number within species appears to be fixed irrespective of germ types: long vs. short / intermediate. The present study showed induction of supernumerary segment formation by the knockdown of Bombyx hunchback (Bm-hb), presumably by terminal segment addition, a short / intermediate-like-segmentation mode that is not observed in normal Bombyx embryogenesis. This suggests that Bm-hb suppresses segmentation. The results obtained also suggest that the gap gene Bm-Kr (Bombyx Krüppel) provides a permissive environment for the progression of segmentation by suppressing the expression Bm-hb, which terminates segmentation. This indicates a novel mechanism by which the gap gene is involved in segmentation. It appears that Bm-Kr and Bm-hb are involved in segment counting and their interplay contributes to the correct number of segments being formed in Bombyx. Similar mechanisms may be operating in insects that employ the non-Drosophilan mode of segmentation such as in short / intermediate-germ insects. "
negative,"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73. Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive bacterium that produces intracellular protein crystals toxic to a wide variety of insect larvae. We report the complete genome sequence of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strain HD73 from the Centre OILB (Institut Pasteur, France), which belongs to serotype 3ab and is toxic to lepidopteran larvae. "
negative,"Reovirus genomes from plant-feeding insects represent a newly discovered lineage within the family Reoviridae. A complex set of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) was isolated from threecornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus), a plant-feeding hemipteran pest. A subset of these dsRNAs constitute the genome of a new reovirus, provisionally designated Spissistilus festinus reovirus (SpFRV). SpFRV was present in threecornered alfalfa hopper populations in the San Joaquin Valley of California, with incidence ranging from 10% to 60% in 24 of 25 sample sets analyzed. The 10 dsRNA segments of SpFRV were completely sequenced and shown to share conserved terminal sequences (5'-AGAGA and CGAUGUUGU-3') of the positive-sense strand that are distinct from known species of the family Reoviridae. Comparisons of the RNA directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) indicated SpFRV is most closely related (39.1% amino acid identity) to another new reovirus infecting the angulate leafhopper (Acinopterus angulatus) and provisionally designated Acinopterus angulatus reovirus (AcARV). The RdRp of both viruses was distantly related to Raspberry latent virus RdRp at 27.0% (SpFRV) and 30.0% (AcARV) or Rice ragged stunt virus RdRp at 26.2% (SpFRV) and 29.0% (AcARV) amino acid identity. RdRp phylogeny confirmed that SpFRV and AcARV are sister taxa sharing a most recent common ancestor. SpFRV segment 6 encodes a protein containing two NTP binding motifs that are conserved in homologs of reoviruses in the subfamily Spinareovirinae. The protein encoded by SpFRV segment 4 was identified as a guanylyltransferase homolog. SpFRV segments 1, 3, and 10 encode homologs of reovirus structural proteins. No homologs were identified for proteins encoded by SpFRV segments 5, 7, 8, and 9. Collectively, the low level of sequence identity with other reoviruses, similar segment terminal sequences, RdRp phylogeny, and host taxa indicate that SpFRV and AcARV may be considered members of a proposed new genus of the family Reoviridae (subfamily Spinareovirinae), with SpFRV assigned as the type species.

positive,"Molecular characterization of glutamate-gated chloride channel and its possible roles in development and abamectin susceptibility in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. Glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) mediate fast inhibitory neurotransmission in invertebrate nervous systems, and are of considerable interest in insecticide discovery. The full length cDNA encoding CsGluCl was cloned from the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis (Walker). Multiple cDNA sequence alignment revealed three variants of CsGluCl generated by alternative splicing of exon 3 and exon 9. While all the transcripts were predominantly expressed in both nerve cord and brain, the expression patterns of these three variants differed among other tissues and developmental stages. Specifically, the expression level of CsGluCl C in cuticle was similar to that in nerve cord and brain, and was the predominant variant in late pupae and early adult stages. Both injection and oral delivery of dsGluCl significantly reduced the mRNA level of CsGluCl. Increased susceptibility to abamectin and reduced larvae growth and pupation rate were observed in dsGluCl-treated larvae. Thus, our results provide the evidence that in addition to act as the target of abamectin, GluCls also play important physiological roles in the development of insects. "
negative,"Functional Immunomics of the Squash Bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer) (Heteroptera: Coreidae). The Squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a major piercing / sucking pest of cucurbits, causing extensive damage to plants and fruits, and transmitting phytopathogens. No genomic resources to facilitate field and laboratory studies of this pest were available; therefore the first de novo exome for this destructive pest was assembled. RNA was extracted from insects challenged with bacterial and fungal immunoelicitors, insects fed on different cucurbit species, and insects from all life stages from egg to adult. All treatments and replicates were separately barcoded for subsequent analyses, then pooled for sequencing in a single lane using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Over 211 million 100-base tags generated in this manner were trimmed, filtered, and cleaned, then assembled into a de novo reference transcriptome using the Broad Institute Trinity assembly algorithm. The assembly was annotated using NCBIx NR, BLAST2GO, KEGG and other databases. Of the >130,000 total assemblies 37,327 were annotated identifying the sequences of candidate gene silencing targets from immune, endocrine, reproductive, cuticle, and other physiological systems. Expression profiling of the adult immune response was accomplished by aligning the 100-base tags from each biological replicate from each treatment and controls to the annotated reference assembly of the A. tristis transcriptome.

negative,"Genome sequence of Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420T, a symbiotic bacterium from entomopathogenic nematode. Serratia nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) (=CGMCC 1.6853(T), DZ0503SBS1(T)), isolated from the intestine of Heterorhabditidoides chongmingensis, has been known to have symbiotic-pathogenic life cycle, on the multilateral relationships with entomopathogenic nematode and insect pest. In order to better understanding of this rare feature in Serratia species, we present here the genome sequence of S. nematodiphila DSM 21420(T) with the significance of first genome sequence in this species.  "
negative,"Large diversity of the piggyBac-like elements in the genome of Tribolium castaneum. The piggyBac transposable element (TE), originally discovered in the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, has been widely used in insect transgenesis including the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We surveyed piggyBac-like (PLE) sequences in the genome of T. castaneum by homology searches using as queries the diverse PLE sequences that have been described previously. The search yielded a total of 32 piggyBac-like elements (TcPLEs) which were classified into 14 distinct groups. Most of the TcPLEs contain defective functional motifs in that they are lacking inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) or have disrupted open reading frames. Only one single copy of TcPLE1 appears to be intact with imperfect 16bp ITRs flanking an open reading frame encoding a transposase of 571 amino acid residues. Many copies of TcPLEs were found to be inserted into or close to other transposon-like sequences. This large diversity of TcPLEs with generally low copy numbers suggests multiple invasions of the TcPLEs over a long evolutionary time without extensive multiplications or occurrence of rapid loss of TcPLEs copies. "
positive,"RNAi of ace1 and ace2 in Blattella germanica reveals their differential contribution to acetylcholinesterase activity and sensitivity to insecticides. Cyclorrhapha insect genomes contain a single acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene while other insects contain at least two ace genes (ace1 and ace2). In this study we tested the hypothesis that the two ace paralogous from Blattella germanica have different contributions to AChE activity, using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown each one individually. Paralogous-specific depletion of Bgace transcripts was evident in ganglia of injected cockroaches, although the effects at the protein level were less pronounced. Using spectrophotometric and zymogram measurements, we obtained evidence that BgAChE1 represents 65-75% of the total AChE activity in nerve tissue demonstrating that ace1 encodes a predominant AChE. A significant increase in sensitivity of Bgace1-interfered cockroaches was observed after 48 h of exposure to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, Bgace2 knockdown had a negligible effect on mortality to this organophosphate. These results point out a key role, qualitative and / or quantitative, of AChE1 as target of organophosphate insecticides in this species. Silencing the expression of Bgace1 but not Bgace2 also produced an increased mortality in insects when synergized with lambda-cyhalothrin, a situation which resembles the synergistic effects observed between organophosphates and pyrethroids. Gene silencing of ace genes by RNAi offers an exciting approach for examining a possible functional differentiation in ace paralogous. "
negative,The promise of insect genomics. Insects are the largest animal group in the world and are ecologically and economically extremely important. This importance of insects is reflected by the existence of currently 24 insect genome projects. Our perspective discusses the state-of-the-art of these genome projects and the impacts that they have on basic insect science and pest control. 
negative,"Delivery of dsRNA for RNAi in insects: an overview and future directions. RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the process of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) silencing the complementary endogenous messenger RNA. RNAi has been widely used in entomological research for functional genomics in a variety of insects and its potential for RNAi-based pest control has been increasingly emphasized mainly because of its high specificity. This review focuses on the approaches of introducing dsRNA into insect cells or insect bodies to induce effective RNAi. The three most common delivery methods, namely, microinjection, ingestion, and soaking, are illustrated in details and their advantages and limitations are summarized for purpose of feasible RNAi research. In this review, we also briefly introduce the two possible dsRNA uptake machineries, other dsRNA delivery methods and the history of RNAi in entomology. Factors that influence the specificity and efficiency of RNAi such as transfection reagents, selection of dsRNA region, length, and stability of dsRNA in RNAi research are discussed for further studies. "
negative,"Genome-wide association study of insect bite hypersensitivity in two horse populations in the Netherlands. BACKGROUND: Insect bite hypersensitivity is a common allergic disease in horse populations worldwide. Insect bite hypersensitivity is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. However, little is known about genes contributing to the genetic variance associated with insect bite hypersensitivity. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify and quantify genomic associations with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses in the Netherlands. METHODS: Data on 200 Shetland pony mares and 146 Icelandic horses were collected according to a matched case-control design. Cases and controls were matched on various factors (e.g. region, sire) to minimize effects of population stratification. Breed-specific genome-wide association studies were performed using 70 k single nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes. Bayesian variable selection method Bayes-C with a threshold model implemented in GenSel software was applied. A 1 Mb non-overlapping window approach that accumulated contributions of adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to identify associated genomic regions. RESULTS: The percentage of variance explained by all single nucleotide polymorphisms was 13% in Shetland pony mares and 28% in Icelandic horses. The 20 non-overlapping windows explaining the largest percentages of genetic variance were found on nine chromosomes in Shetland pony mares and on 14 chromosomes in Icelandic horses. Overlap in identified associated genomic regions between breeds would suggest interesting candidate regions to follow-up on. Such regions common to both breeds (within 15 Mb) were found on chromosomes 3, 7, 11, 20 and 23. Positional candidate genes within 2 Mb from the associated windows were identified on chromosome 20 in both breeds. Candidate genes are within the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region, which evokes an immune response by recognizing many foreign molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The genome-wide association study identified several genomic regions associated with insect bite hypersensitivity in Shetland pony mares and Icelandic horses. On chromosome 20, associated genomic regions in both breeds were within 2 Mb from the equine lymphocyte antigen class II region. Increased knowledge on insect bite hypersensitivity associated genes will contribute to our understanding of its biology, enabling more efficient selection, therapy and prevention to decrease insect bite hypersensitivity prevalence. "
negative,"Knockdown of midgut genes by dsRNA-transgenic plant-mediated RNA interference in the hemipteran insect Nilaparvata lugens. BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technique for functional genomics research in insects. Transgenic plants producing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directed against insect genes have been reported for lepidopteran and coleopteran insects, showing potential for field-level control of insect pests, but this has not been reported for other insect orders. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Hemipteran insect brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål) is a typical phloem sap feeder specific to rice (Oryza sativa L.). To analyze the potential of exploiting RNAi-mediated effects in this insect, we identified genes (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) encoding proteins that might be involved in the RNAi pathway in N. lugens. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously in nymphs and adult insects. Three genes (the hexose transporter gene NlHT1, the carboxypeptidase gene Nlcar and the trypsin-like serine protease gene Nltry) that are highly expressed in the N. lugens midgut were isolated and used to develop dsRNA constructs for transforming rice. RNA blot analysis showed that the dsRNAs were transcribed and some of them were processed to siRNAs in the transgenic lines. When nymphs were fed on rice plants expressing dsRNA, levels of transcripts of the targeted genes in the midgut were reduced; however, lethal phenotypic effects after dsRNA feeding were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that genes for the RNAi pathway (Nlsid-1 and Nlaub) are present in N. lugens. When insects were fed on rice plant materials expressing dsRNAs, RNA interference was triggered and the target genes transcript levels were suppressed. The gene knockdown technique described here may prove to be a valuable tool for further investigations in N. lugens. The results demonstrate the potential of dsRNA-mediated RNAi for field-level control of planthoppers, but appropriate target genes must be selected when designing the dsRNA-transgenic plants. "
negative,"Metabolic pools differ among ecologically diverse Drosophila species. Studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying metabolic storage have focused on a few model organisms. Although very fruitful, these studies have not allowed for the examination of mechanisms across a phylogenetic spectrum. The exploration of natural patterns of metabolic pool size variation across species will help us to better understand the genetics of metabolic adaptation. We examined the metabolic pools size (triglyceride, glycogen and protein) at two ages in 12 Drosophila species with distinctly different ecologies for which complete genome sequences (for 11 of the 12 species) are known. Overall, there were significant differences across species for all three pools, while age and sex appear to affect some metabolic pools more than others. After correcting for the phylogenetic relatedness of the species used, we observed no association between triglyceride and glycogen content. Although within species these two pools sometimes are correlated, at a larger phylogenetic scale control of triglyceride and glycogen contents may have been shaped independently by natural selection. "
negative,"RNA interference in the termite Reticulitermes flavipes through ingestion of double-stranded RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) represents a breakthrough technology for conducting functional genomics research in non-model organisms and for the highly targeted control of insect pests. This study investigated RNAi via voluntary feeding in the economically important pest termite, Reticulitermes flavipes. We used a high-dose double-stranded (ds) RNA feeding approach to silence two termite genes: one encoding an endogenous digestive cellulase enzyme and the other a caste-regulatory hexamerin storage protein. Contrary to results from previous low-dose studies that examined injection-based RNAi, high-dose silencing of either gene through dsRNA feeding led to significantly reduced group fitness and mortality. Hexamerin silencing in combination with ectopic juvenile hormone treatments additionally led to lethal molting impacts and increased differentiation of presoldier caste phenotypes (a phenotype that is not capable of feeding). These results provide the first examples of insecticidal effects from dsRNA feeding in a termite. Additionally, these results validate a high-throughput bioassay approach for use in (i) termite functional genomics research, and (ii) characterizing target sites of conventional and novel RNAi-based termiticides. "
negative,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and comparative analysis with five additional insects. Glutathione S-transferases are important detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide resistance. Sequencing the Tribolium castaneum genome provides an opportunity to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of GSTs on a genome-wide scale. Thirty-six putative cytosolic GSTs and 5 microsomal GSTs have been identified in T. castaneum. Furthermore, 40, 35, 13, 23, and 32 GSTs have been discovered the other insects, Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Acyrthosiphon, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that insect-specific GSTs, Epsilon and Delta, are the largest species-specific expanded GSTs. In T. castaneum, most GSTs are tandemly arranged in three chromosomes. Particularly, Epsilon GSTs have an inverted long-fragment duplication in the genome. Other four widely distributed classes are highly conserved in all species. Given that GSTs specially expanded in Tribolium castaneum, these genes might help to resist poisonous chemical environments and produce resistance to kinds of different insecticides. "
positive,"Cloning of a putative Bombyx mori TFIIB-related factor (BRF). To identify the protein domains responsible for its conserved and specialized functions, putative TFIIB-Related Factor (BRF) from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) was compared with BRFs from other organisms. The Bombyx BRF coding region was assembled from three separate and overlapping cDNA fragments. Fragments encoding the middle portion and the 3' end were discovered in the Bombyx mori Genome Project ""Silkbase"" collection through sequence homology with human BRF1, and the fragment encoding the N-terminus was isolated in our laboratory using the 5' RACE method. Southern analysis showed that silkworm BRF is encoded by a single-copy gene. Bombyx BRF contains the following domains that have been noted in all other BRFs, and that are likely, therefore, to provide highly conserved functions: a zinc finger domain, an imperfect repeat, three ""BRF Homology"" domains, and an acidic domain at the C-terminus. As expected from the evolutionary relationships among insects and mammals, Bombyx BRF is more similar overall to Drosophila BRF (55% identical) than to human BRF1 (42% identical). Detailed examination of individual domains reveals a remarkable exception, however. Domain II of Bombyx BRF is more similar to its human counterpart than to Drosophila Domain II. This result indicates that Domain II has undergone unusual divergence in Drosophila, and suggests a structural basis for Drosophila BRF's unique pattern of interaction with other transcription factors. "
positive,"Domain structure and expression along the midgut and carcass of peritrophins and cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins in insects with and without peritrophic membrane. Most insects have a peritrophic membrane (matrix) (PM) surrounding the food bolus. This structure, similarly to the cuticle, is mainly composed of chitin and proteins. The main proteins forming PM are known as peritrophins (PMP), whereas some of the cuticle proteins are the cuticle proteins analogous to peritrophins (CPAP). Both proteins are composed of one or more chitin binding peritrophin-A domain (CBD) and no other recognized domain. Furthermore, insects containing PM usually have two chitin synthase (CS) genes, one mainly expressed in carcass and the other in midgut. In this work we identified PMP, CPAP and CS genes in the genome of insects from the Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera and Holometabola cohorts and analyzed their expression profile in different species from each group. In agreement with the absence of PM, we observed less CBD-containing proteins and only one CS gene in the genome of Paraneoptera species, except for the Phthiraptera Pediculus humanus. The lack of PM in Paraneoptera species was also confirmed by the micrographs of the midgut of two Hemiptera species, Dysdercus peruvianus and Mahanarva fimbriolata which agreed with the RNA-seq data of both species. Our analyses also highlighted a higher number of CBD-containing proteins in Holometabola in relation to the earlier divergent Polyneoptera group, especially regarding the genes composed of more than three CBDs, which are usually associated to PM formation. Finally, we observed a high number of CBD-containing proteins being expressed in both midgut and carcass tissues of several species, which we named as ubiquitous-CBD-containing proteins (UCBP), as their function is unclear. We hypothesized that these proteins can be involved in both cuticle and PM formation or that they can be involved in immune response and / or tracheolae formation. "
positive,"Multiple functions of CREB-binding protein during postembryonic development: identification of target genes. BACKGROUND: Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect. RESULTS: CBP is ubiquitously expressed in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of CBP resulted in a decrease in JH induction of Kr-h1 gene expression in Tribolium larvae and led to a block in their development. Moreover, the injection of CBP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) showed lethal phenotypes within 8 days of injection. RNA-seq and subsequent differential gene expression analysis identified CBP target genes in Tribolium. Knockdown of CBP caused a decrease in the expression of 1306 genes coding for transcription factors and other proteins associated with growth and development. Depletion of CBP impaired the expression of several JH response genes (e.g., Kr-h1, Hairy, early trypsin) and ecdysone response genes (EcR, E74, E75, and broad complex). Further, GO enrichment analyses of the downregulated genes showed enrichment in different functions including developmental processes, pigmentation, anatomical structure development, regulation of biological and cellular processes, etc. CONCLUSION: These data suggest diverse but crucial roles for CBP during postembryonic development in the coleopteran model insect, Tribolium. It can serve as a target for RNAi mediated pest management of this stored product pest. "
negative,"Genome-wide analysis of phenobarbital-inducible genes in Drosophila melanogaster. An oligoarray analysis was conducted to determine the differential expression of genes due to phenobarbital exposure in Drosophila melanogaster (w(1118) strain) third instar larvae. Seventeen genes were observed to be induced with increased expression by a statistical analysis of microarrays approach with a q < or = 0.05. At q < or = 0.12, four more genes (Cyp12d1, DmGstd4, and two genes with unknown function) were found to be up-regulated, and 11 genes with unknown function were found to be down-regulated. Fifteen of these genes, Cyp4d14, Cyp6a2, Cyp6a8, Cyp12d1, Cyp6d5, Cyp6w1, CG2065, DmGstd6, DmGstd7, Amy-p / Amy-d, Ugt86Dd, GC5724, Jheh1, Jheh2 and CG11893, were verified using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Some of these genes have been shown to be over-transcribed in metabolically DDT-resistant Drosophila strains. "
negative,"Phylogeny and evolution of the cholesterol transporter NPC1 in insects. Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b. "
negative,"Extensive genetic diversity among populations of the malaria mosquito Anopheles moucheti revealed by population genomics. Malaria vectors are exposed to intense selective pressures due to large-scale intervention programs that are underway in most African countries. One of the current priorities is therefore to clearly assess the adaptive potential of Anopheline populations, which is critical to understand and anticipate the response mosquitoes can elicit against such adaptive challenges. The development of genomic resources that will empower robust examinations of evolutionary changes in all vectors including currently understudied species is an inevitable step toward this goal. Here we constructed double-digest Restriction Associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries and generated 6461 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that we used to explore the population structure and demographic history of wild-caught Anopheles moucheti from Cameroon. The genome-wide distribution of allelic frequencies among samples best fitted that of an old population at equilibrium, characterized by a weak genetic structure and extensive genetic diversity, presumably due to a large long term effective population size. Estimates of FST and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs reveal a very low genetic differentiation throughout the genome and the absence of segregating LD blocks among populations, suggesting an overall lack of local adaptation. Our study provides the first investigation of the genetic structure and diversity in An. moucheti at the genomic scale. We conclude that, despite a weak genetic structure, this species has the potential to challenge current vector control measures and other rapid anthropogenic and environmental changes thanks to its great genetic diversity. "
negative,"Discovery, adaptation and transcriptional activity of two tick promoters: Construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for optimization of RNA interference in rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus cell lines. Dual luciferase reporter systems are valuable tools for functional genomic studies, but have not previously been developed for use in tick cell culture. We evaluated expression of available luciferase constructs in tick cell cultures derived from Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, an important vector of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Commercial promoters were evaluated for transcriptional activity driving luciferase expression in the tick cell lines. The human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter resulted in detectable firefly luciferase activity within 2 days post-transfection of the R. microplus cell line BME26, with maximal activity at 5 days post-transfection. Several other promoters were weaker or inactive in the tick cells, prompting identification and assessment of transcriptional activity of the homologous ribosomal protein L4 (rpL4, GenBank accession no.: KM516205) and elongation factor 1α (EF-1α, GenBank accession no.: KM516204) promoters cloned from R. microplus. Evaluation of luciferase expression driven by various promoters in tick cell culture resulted in selection of the R. microplus rpL4 promoter and the human PGK promoter driving transcription of sequences encoding modified firefly and NanoLuc® luciferases for construction of a dual luciferase reporter system for use in tick cell culture.  "
negative,"Engineering the genomes of wild insect populations: challenges, and opportunities provided by synthetic Medea selfish genetic elements. Advances in insect transgenesis and our knowledge of insect physiology and genomics are making it possible to create transgenic populations of beneficial or pest insects that express novel traits. There are contexts in which we may want the transgenes responsible for these traits to spread so that all individuals within a wild population carry them, a process known as population replacement. Transgenes of interest are unlikely to confer an overall fitness benefit on those who carry them. Therefore, an essential component of any population replacement strategy is the presence of a drive mechanism that will ensure the spread of linked transgenes. We discuss contexts in which population replacement might be desirable and the requirements a drive system must satisfy to be both effective and safe. We then describe the creation of synthetic Medea elements, the first selfish genetic elements synthesized de novo, with the capability of driving population replacement, in this case in Drosophila. The strategy used to create Drosophila Medea is applicable to a number of other insect species and the Medea system satisfies key requirements for scientific and social acceptance. Finally, we highlight several challenges to implementing population replacement in the wild. "
positive,"The limpet transcription factors of Triatoma infestans regulate the response to fungal infection and modulate the expression pattern of defensin genes. As part of the innate humoral response to microbial attack, insects activate the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of this response in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans is important since biological control strategies against pyrethroid-resistant insect populations were recently addressed by using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. By bioinformatics, gene expression, and silencing techniques in T. infestans nymphs, we achieved sequence and functional characterization of two variants of the limpet transcription factor (Tilimpet) and studied their role as regulators of the AMP expression, particularly defensins, in fungus-infected insects. We found that Tilimpet variants may act differentially since they have divergent sequences and different relative expression ratios, suggesting that Tilimpet-2 could be the main regulator of the higher expressed defensins and Tilimpet-1 might play a complementary or more general role. Also, the six defensins (Tidef-1 to Tidef-6) exhibited different expression levels in fungus-infected nymphs, consistent with their phylogenetic clustering. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of T. infestans immune response in which limpet is involved, after challenge by B. bassiana infection. "
